            <p>Hello Vicky,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. Sorry to hear that you are unable to see your photos after importing them in Photo Gallery. Let me help you with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the option "Delete files from device after importing" was enabled when you imported your photos, the photos are deleted from the device and not in your computer. I would like to verify if you selected a location of your photos before importing. If
 yes, I would like you to check that location in order to see or view the photos. If not, the default location is in My Pictures folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent from this happening again, I would like you to disable the option that deletes the files from your device after importing them in Photo Gallery. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Start <strong>Photo Gallery</strong>.</p>
<p>2. On your keyboard, press <strong>Alt + F</strong> and <strong>O</strong>.</p>
<p>3. On <em>Import</em> tab, uncheck <strong>Delete files from device after importing</strong> option.</p>
<p>4. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have further questions, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft store not letting me purchase anything</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 and the Microsoft store will not let me purchase anything. I have both my profile address and payment methods&nbsp;on file with the store. I can download free apps but if it costs anything it will not let me buy it. What happens is that
 when I click on the price button and put in my password I get one of two windows. These are 'add a new payment method' and 'add profile address'. Both of these windows ask for an address to be typed in. The problem is that in both you cannot change the country
 from the United States to the one you live in, or change the province/state to one out of the United States. Also the Postal Code must be in the form of an American Zip Code, if it is not it calls your&nbsp;correct Postal Code invalid. These three things block
 your purchase from going any further. Which means that if you are a non US resident you cannot buy anything off the store. This blocking occurs no matter how you access the store. I have tried going through the app that came with the computer, and on the internet
 through the various Microsoft stores(eg. Microsoft store Canada, Microsoft store USA, Microsoft store UK ,etc.,). I have been blocked every time.&nbsp;Going to customer service and tech support is of no use. Over the past two weeks they have consistently ignored
 me, have&nbsp;said &nbsp;it is beyond them, that they do not know, hanged up on&nbsp;me,&nbsp;have not&nbsp;picked up the phone, have disconnected me from the chat line (after I spent&nbsp; 1 1/2 hours waiting for them and was in the middle of typing in my first response), treating&nbsp;me
 like&nbsp;I was are an idiot and then telling&nbsp;me to go find out&nbsp;the answer for myself (that from a Tech manager). This is not customer service or tech support. What is the money of non US citizens not good enough for them</p>

            <p>After about an hour with Sales over at the Microsoft store, we were able to track down the cause of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps use the region setting found on the computer, not your billing profile. To fix this, left click the 'language' on the task bar and go to 'language preferences'</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the new window that pops up, switch the 'Country or region' setting to your actual region. Once changed, it takes effect immediately and apps will know which set of billing details to pull out of your Microsoft account and let you finish your purchase.</p>

<p><span>Can you boot into safe mode with networking? If so, that's great.&nbsp; If not, skip the following steps that require you to boot into the system (except the clean
 boot one even if it doesn't end up working) and just do those that can be done from the disk and reply back with results.&nbsp; I don't know why you think a windows installer redistributable is required (the error message you posted said nothing about that) but
 if it is being requested then something besides Vista is trying to install at startup and we must find and remove that.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong><span>BEFORE</span></strong> the
 problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</strong></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></span></span></a><span><span><strong>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using</p>
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span>oot into Safe mode with networking and see if
 the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to start /
 search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click
 on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft
 Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

                    In older version of Windows Media Player this could be accomplished. I like to keep my music in folders for easy transfer to devices that don't sync well with Windows Media Player. Having thousands of mp3 files in one directory is a pain.<br />

Can you not do this anymore? It seems the functionality was lost in Windows Media Player 12.<br />
<br />
Example - C:\Users\Public\Music\%Artist%\%Album%\Metallica - Seek and Destroy.mp3<br />
<br />
You used to be able to set the rip settings, and it would go through and organize all your songs by dropping them in folders like what I am showing above.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Tim Bryant<br />

<p>
</p><p>The final question in your response indicates to me that you are not human, a computer and/or both. Since we are trying to create a new account, that he has never had an account before, that we are waiting to get the code to start the account so he can use
 your Skype App, what exact Skype version do you think it is? Do you think it might be your latest version? Perhaps? You know, since this is a brand new account as of March 27, 2018. Does it help to know if it's a MAC? It's for a MAC. But, this should have
 absolutely nothing to do with his not getting the code in his email in order to even sign on. He can't sign on. There is no issue because he can't sign on. Is there another piece of information, or a special word, or code phrase you need in order to respond
 to the problem? Does he need to set up a mobile phone to get a text message as an option?&nbsp;</p>

<h3> keaton01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Disconnects when coming up from sleep and doesn&#39;t automatically connect when rebooting.</h2>
                    
<p>Under Windows XP my network stayed connected always and when I rebooted it would connect automatically. Under Windows 7 it won't. I believe I found every setting that tells the system to do it, but it doesn't.</p>
<p>and another strange thing.</p>
<p>When the sleeping comes from sleeping it will disconnect. If I had a slower system I would say that it didn't connect, but no I'm able to open a browser open a page and then ding it disconnects and I have to tell it to connect again.</p>
<p>This is awfully annoying! Please help!I</p>
<p>I will add that my pc connects to my network through a wireless card.</p>

 and welcome to the Skype Community!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong><em>How do I send a Skype Request for a call to take place using a Skype address?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>Can you clarify what you meant by a Skype address and a Skype request?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to initiate a call on Skype, you just need to make sure of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You are using the latest version of Skype.&nbsp;</li><li>You have a stable Internet connection and;</li><li>The Skype contact you will be calling is Online.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As long as the Skype user you want to call is part of your contact list and is Online, you can call him/her right away. If you want your contact to call you, you can send him/her an instant message to call you instead. If the user you want to call is still
 not part of your contact list, send him/her a contact request by following these steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Contacts</strong>.</li><li>Click the search text box and type the Skype name or email address of the person you want to add and click&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2fscreenshots%2ffa3281%2ffa3281_8.png" />&nbsp;Search
 Skype.</li><li>Select your friend from the search results and click <strong>Add to Contacts</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>You can type in a quick note for introduction as well, and click <strong>Send</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<div>I've installed Nod32 antivirus and Action Center for some reason is mad at me :/</div>
<div>All im saying is that Action Center keeps on Spamming a message about Nod32 but then after a really short time it takes it away like the issue is fixed, so all i read is Nod32. My antivirus says im fully protected which means it is active, why is Action
 center keeps spamming me this message ? It's really annoying since its happening all the time... It happens and then again in a about 3 - 6 seconds.</div>

What's the exact message that the Action Center shows?

            I have Nod32 antivirus 5, i just downloaded from the official site yesterday, its the latest version.
<div>I also have a valid key for it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can't read the message from action center because it is only shown for like 0.1 second then it closes and if i try openning Action Center, all i see is that " No current issues detected ".</div>
<div><br />
<div>So since i couldn't read the message like that, i focused to the point it would pop up again later, so after about 3 - 6 seconds (it doesn't pop up after the same value of seconds) i read "ESET Nod32".</div>
<div><br />
<div>Im currently downloading a video recorder so i can record and freeze the message.</div>

            I guess we all are having the same issue, mine started after I installed windows updates. its saying my virus protection is off and then it goes away in like 1 second. and it keeps doing it, untill I went to action center and then "Change Action Center
 Settings" and unchecked "Spyware and unwanted software protection" and "Virus Protection". Not sure whats wrong with it.

            I am having the same issue with Windows 8 and&nbsp;ESET Security Center 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as if the&nbsp;two programs are&nbsp;battling one another.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went into the Action Center and had to unclick spyware, virus and firewall settings in the first set of choices.&nbsp; This seems
 to have stopped the flash-pop ups from Windows 8.

            Wdb files are MS Works files.&nbsp; Since most (all) versions of works are not compatible you can convert them to an MS office file.&nbsp; There are a bunch of ways to do this.&nbsp; Might want to Google opening wdb files for the various methods.

<p>I upgraded to the xbox one 3 days ago and since then I've noticed that none of the games/achievements on the xbox.com website are updated.</p>
<p>It still has the last games I played on my 360 though.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this is? Or how it can be fixed?</p>

<p>The &nbsp;site have not updated to &nbsp;record XBOX ONE activity on the site. If you want to get all of XBOX ONE activity on your computer. &nbsp;Is to get the XBOX ONE smart glass. &nbsp;but you need a WINDOWS 8 to do that. But you have ISO, ANDOIRD and WP8. You can used
 them as well to see them on there. &nbsp;It the same reason you can not see activity's on the 360. I know this as a fact. Because I have online friends with XBOX ONE. And what game they played on there XBOX ONE just says XBOX ONE on &nbsp;there gamer card. And when
 I compare to my games. &nbsp;So they might update it on other LIVE platforms &nbsp;in the future. but do not hold your breath. Because I have no idea this will happen or take place's.</p>

            Hello Anna,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />On login screen, once you login with password, Windows continues to ask you password in successive logins, until you select PIN option yourself.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if you've no plans to use PIN login, you can remove it from Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<div>&nbsp;hi all,<br />
</div>
every time my computer reboots, a weird folder is created on the c drive. this folder has a random alpha-numeric name and contains a bunch of windows update stuff.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vistax64.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fconfused.gif" />
 when i reboot, another folder is created with the exact same contents but with a different folder name...now i have ~15 of these weird folders<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vistax64.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2feek.gif" /> . i think it's
 related to updates because the folders contains files such as:<br />
WUClient-SelfUpdate-ActiveX.cab<br />
WUClient-SelfUpdate-Aux-TopLevel.cab<br />
wusetup.exe<br />
<br />
i'm having trouble deleting the folders due to permissions and "folder is being used"...but i'm not concerned about deleting them right now. what i'm really concerned with is stopping their creation! another odd thing is that if i connect an external usb drive,
 the new folders will be created on the <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Program will not close when click on close - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coldsnap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Program will not close when click on close</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Hand of God needs to smite these programs and close them.<br />
When I tell a program to close it is obviously frustrating to have the program defy my will and remain open.</p>
<p>Such is often the case with iTunes, and frequently with other programs.</p>
<p>I hit the X: no result<br />
I right click &gt; close window:&nbsp;no result<br />
I ctrl+shift+esc &gt; select the application and end task:&nbsp;no result<br />
I go to the process tab and select the process and tell it to end process:&nbsp;no result</p>
<p>Finally I closed all other programs and told my computer to restart:&nbsp;no result<br />
The computer got stuck for 10 minutes trying to shut down until I disconnected the power.</p>
<p>I am wondering why this happens, and why Windows cannot have some higher authority over a program that is running and force it closed.</p>

<p>Hi ColdSnap</p>
<p>Well, from the title of your thread and description, maybe it's time to take a break from computing, maybe go take a walk in the park and relax for a while.<span>J</span></p>
<p>OK, that was just some teasing.</p>
<p>Seriously, when a program refuses to close,&nbsp;this usually indicates that the program is performing a critical function and closing could cause corruption in the program. This can happen even though the system&nbsp;may view the program as being in a non-responding
 state. Forcing a program to close can cause any one of a&nbsp;long list of problems.</p>
<p>Never pull the plug on a computer. Doing so can immediately turn the machine into a large brick.</p>
<p>What you need to do is try and determine the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>Check with the developer of the program for any known issues.</p>
<p>Open Control Panel and type Troubleshoot in the Search Box. In the results you will see many installed troubleshooters that can be run to discover and fix problems.</p>
<p>Run the System File Checker. Open an elevated command prompt, type SFC /SCANNOW and press Enter.</p>

<p>Hey Ronnie,</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to reply.</p>
<p>Walk in the park not actually necessary ; ) I am a very level headed individual and I wrote this thread after countless years of having the same problem. (Windows 98 user)&nbsp;Obviously this problem is not always this dramatic and debilitating, still frustrating
 though.</p>
<p>I have (previous to writing this thread) tried some of your suggestions already, will give the other ones a shot and let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post Script:</p>
<p>Program in question this time was iTunes.</p>

<p>Hello ColdSnap,</p>
<p>Check and see if you have any other program that is configured to automatically decect and download files from connected devices, such as a camera, video camera, phone etc. If you disable this feature you should be able to close iTunes.</p>
<p>Please reply back with an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
