            Your friend would need to file a complaint on him via the console, however, since DDoS attacks are done through the internet and not Live, the enforcement team won't be able to do anything unless he did something over Live. Otherwise, he would want to
 contact his ISP as well to alert them of the issue.&nbsp;

            <p>Lawrence, Hi...</p>
<p>This sounds like a symptom and you probably need to look beyond this section of the forum. What has been happening with Windows Updates - have they been problematic? If unsure check your Windows Update history via Control Panel... Have you got all your personal
 you have to reinstall your OS. </p>
<p>If your files are already copied you could try system restore back to a point before the problem started but that might fail and in the short-term make things worse - hence the need for the back-up, but come back and advise on your Windows Updates first.
 Cheers, Ric.</p>

            Three years isn't that old - my Dell's six years and going strong but I have had to reinstall Windows twice! That may be worth trying if you have good copies of your files. It does sound more like OS failure than anything hardware related. What make is
 it? Cheers, Ric.

            <p>I am not familiar with Medion - I could not locate your model via a web-search.</p>
<p>If you decide to replace it you are going to be looking at Windows 10 -&nbsp;which I am keen to avoid for as long as possible! I like the W7 OS. I'd certainly try a re-install of Windows first - make sure you get all Windows Updates back in before reconfiguring
 whatever security software you use... and before installing any third-party software. Only install Important Updates along with recommended ones that are relevant. Leave optional updates alone.</p>
<p>Best - R.</p>

            Hi Jay
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You can't designate the time it downloads, but you can designate the time it installs, that is what Active Hours is for.
<br />
<br />If you want to block Windows Update and enable it at a time you find suitable, then you can consider the following options.
<br />
<br />Please note, Microsoft's approach to updates is very different that earlier releases. They are basically mandatory because of Microsoft's past history with customers sometimes failing to install important updates.
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.
<br />
<br />stop-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= disabled
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= disabled
<br />net stop dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />start-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= auto
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= auto
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= auto
<br />net start dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />Now you can simply right click on stop-updates.bat and select Run as Administrator
<br />

<p>Hi, I don't pretend to be any kind of bigshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea of Active Hours is that your computer won't&nbsp;<em>restart</em> to install an update during Active Hours. It's the restart that disrupts your work. Downloading the bits in the backgroud is managed so as not the interfere with your other uses of internet
 bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates aren't the only thing that gets downloaded in the background. Your applications can also download in the background, particularly antivirus definitions. Your computer can also upload in the background, to cloud storage, for example. All this down-
 and uploading in the background doesn't affect your computer's performance. It&nbsp;<em>can</em> affect your internet speed, which is why it's managed so as not use much (or any) bandwidth while you're using it for other things.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp;suspecting that this thing has something to do with my recent Windows re-install, since I didn't have this issue before.</p>
<p>Some other PCs in my work place have similar issues, but none of the MACs.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#8217;t recognise WD Passport USB drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m having trouble getting my WD Passport drive up and running on Windows 10. The Apps seem to have installed okay but I can’t access the hard drive through the USB drive. I read online that WD Passport is incompatible with the latest versions of Windows
 10. I followed some online instructions to try and make it compatible but it didnt work. I’m a complete amateur with computers so I probably missed sonething very obvious. Can anyone advise where I’m going wring with this please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanking you in advance, Tony 🙂</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft community!
<br />
<br />if indeed the updates are not compatible, but this possible solution can help you
<br />
<br />
<br />Enter Start and in the search box digited cmd, you will see the option cmd.exe, right click on this option and in the pop-up menu select Run as administrator.
<br />At the command line, type set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices = 1 and press Enter.
<br />Then type start devmgmt.msc and press Enter again.
<br />In the device manager window, click View and then Show hidden devices.
<br />
<br />Display the Universal Serial Bus Controllers menu.
<br />On each device marked as generic, right click and then click Properties.
<br />Click on the Driver tab and then on the Uninstall button.
<br />
<br />After you have uninstalled the drivers for each USB device that has ever been connected, restart the computer and reconnect your external hard drive, the device drivers will be installed.

<p>In the snapshot you posted there might be some extra details further down. They would become visible when you pull the scroll bar all the way down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some external USB disks consume more current than a single USB output can deliver (0.5 Amps). They are sold with a Y-cable. One plug goes into the USB case, the other two into two free USB sockets on the PC. If you use a straight rather than a Y-cable then
 the disk may not work.</p>

<p>Are you trying to perform an in place upgrade from XP or Vista?&nbsp; If so as these are end of life operating systems that doesn't surprise me.&nbsp; Other way to upgrade from one of these would be to perform a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the media creation tool this will enable you to create bootable media with a Windows 10 installer.</p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />Since you're using the instalation media - instead of just trying to install it straight up, try to use Greg's clean install guide: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know if this fixes your issue. If not, Please update with further inquiries. :)

            Skype to Skype calls are free, This I am talking about you installing Skype on your phone / computer and other party also has Skype on phone/computer. This is free irrespective of the fact where a person is located in the world.
<br />
<br />Now coming back to why you would need a Skype telephone number
<br />1. Calling from Skype is pretty cheap. Cheaper than regular telecom providers. You can also buy unlimited call packages.
<br />2. You can make group calls. You can add as many as 25 persons.
<br />3. People can call up on your Skype number and it will reach you wherever you are in the world.
<br />4. You can set up forwarding also on Skype phone number.
<br />5. You can set up Caller ID.
<br />6. A very strong feature is video calls. You can make individual or group video calls.
<br />7. Strong messaging features
<br />8. Voice messages

            The way I understand it, calling another Skype user or calling a toll-free phone number doesn't require a Skype number or Skype credit. However, placing calls to a mobile or landline does require purchasing some Skype credit. Only if you want phone numbers to reach you via Skype do you need to get a Skype number.

<h2>            File History backup and exclude settings are completely ignored resulting in massive storage use</h2>
                    <p>File History backup and exclude settings are completely ignored resulting in massive storage use.</p>
<p>File History also includes OneDrive and Public Backups which I don't want or need, but can't get rid of because of the settings being ignored.</p>
<p>This issue appears to have been around from the inception of File History in Windows 8.</p>
<p>From what I've seen in responses to this issue Microsoft doesn't have an answer and agents keeps posting pointless generics such as FAQ links and "How To Use" instructions.</p>
<p>Is File History ever going to be fixed or can someone suggest a decent third party solution?</p>

            <p>Are you using the latest v1511 10586.29. The reason I asked is I noticed the same as you but since the Nov release and up to now I am able to exclude Google drive and One Drive. (plus others) Currently my File History is backing up what I require.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only thing I had done prior to the Nov update was to exclude folders within Google and One Drive and that worked.</p>

            <p>Hi Neilpzz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I'm on the 1511 10586.29 version of Windows 10 and File History backup and exclude settings are ignored.</p>
<p>These settings have never worked for me and more worryingly the Backup settings are added to by the system for no good reason after File History runs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem I've discovered, is that File History closes down once a backup is in progress and if reopened closes again straight away. &nbsp;It can only be opened successfully once the backup has finished. &nbsp;With no progress meter and no way to determine the
 completion time, this means leaving it overnight before attempting to open it again. &nbsp;Bottom line, it's just poorly designed and shoddy software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As File History doesn't work correctly, I've turned it off. However for those who continue to use it, if it has such glaring bugs for some, the probability is low that any backups it creates can be trusted... at best it gives the Customer a false sense of
 security and needs to be fixed.</p>

            I had the same problem excluding files. My solution was to turn File History off. I save copies of data folders to One Drive and do a monthly full system backup to an external Hard Drive.

            I am total P--SED at poor backup software and I use SyncToy for my backups. No inbuilt scheduling but you can always use Task Scheduler to run it automatically. &nbsp;It is old and has an odd glitch and is very slow for the first run, but it works, is fully
 customisable, you can see what is doing, reports any problems at the end, is free and works with attached or network storage.

            <p>I agree I have not been able to find one thing that works. I will try starting it once and not re-opening because I was unaware that once it was opened again the previous would be closed. The lack of status bar is ridiculous, I have no idea when it will
 complete. Microsoft does not seem to have a fix, or support for this and even suggested I re-install. THANKS MICROSOFT! This is awful and I will probably go to a 3rd part software to backup my computer.<br />

            <p>Hi CO,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would appear that Microsoft are afraid to provide a proper piece of kit and then fall into the same problem as they did with IE in Europe, plus upsetting all the Backup Software providers; they could however provide it as an available extra. &nbsp;I
 really have tried to find a reliable alternative to SyncToy but nothing seems to work like it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most Backup Software want to start from fresh, or even a clean HDD. &nbsp;My data is on a separate partition because I dual boot and it could be used by both Win10 and Win8.1, BUT there are now
<em>permission problems</em> relating to a common Data Files so now only have Win8 as failsafe. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I have tested the free Backup Sotware versions and refuse to commit to the
<em>paid for</em>&nbsp;version unless I know it will provide what I want, a catch 22, but I will not give £40 to every hopeful provider just to find it fails my needs!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>RO's&nbsp;</strong>earlier post re whole system backups is only practical, I feel, with a minor amount of data, I have 2TB a on separate HDD that is added to almost daily and this is mirrored by another HDD as my Laptop only holds 1TB including 2 OSes.
 &nbsp;One HDD is attached to my TP Link router and it acts as a media server for music, videos and photos.<br />

            I have a lot more than 2TB on my systems, and don't need to back it all up every single time. Any good backup program will allow you to create a complete base image (which you can do, say, once a month), and then smaller incremental (daily/weekly) backups
 containing only the data modified since the last backup.

            <p>Hi RO,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;That is OK if the backup software was used for the original data loading &nbsp;but mine pre exists. &nbsp;The backup also needs to be accessible for media sharing via the router service and some do not permit that, such as Ms File History. &nbsp;SyncToy works well but
 does not work in the background adding new and changed files as they occur on the fly. &nbsp; If I were working regular hours I could program the backup for a period when I was at lunch say or when I finish with an auto shutdown, on the fly is so much simpler.
 &nbsp;Another problem is error reporting which a lot that I have tried do not seem very good at doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just searched using "on the fly" and it found some references I have not seen before. &nbsp;FreeFileSync looks a possible with some others, there seem to be quite a few people with the same need as I. &nbsp;I have been silly enough to restrict my search to Backup
 Software only when I should have known better. Any experience with FFS?</p>

<br />
<br />Then click your Profile Picture
<br />
<br />On the next page, under your Profile Picture is your Skype Name, which begins with live: . . .
<br />
<br />That is your Skype ID that you provide to other people so they can find you on Skype . . .

            Hi Urban
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To find Skype Name / Skype ID / Skype Address
<br />
<br />Click on your profile picture in top left corner &gt; In the resultant screen, click on Skype profile and you will have Skype Name which is also called Skype ID or Skype Address
<br />OR
<br />Click on 3 dots on top &gt; Settings &gt; Account &amp; Profile &gt; On right side, you will have Skype Name
<br />OR
<br />Another way to get Skype Name / ID is to type following command in any chat and Enter. One of the fields is Skypename: in the output
<br />/dumpmsnp
<br />(The output will be displayed to you only. The contact whose window did you entered this in will neither see the command nor the output)

            More info on Hidden Photos issue:<br />
<br />
This has been widespread recently and is apparently related <br />
to McAfee. Editing causes photos to become hidden.<br />
<br />
The files are not missing...they are hidden.&nbsp; Try changing the <br />
following setting and the photos should re-appear.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 - Show hidden files<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files</a><br />
<br />
When the photo thumbs reappear...they may look washed out...<br />
to clear that up...right click one photo or a selected group or a <br />
folder and choose...Properties...uncheck the box....."Hidden" / <br />
Apply / OK.<br />
<br />

            Do you use McAfee?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There has been many posts that seem to say that McAfee or one of it's updates has caused this problem.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Most likely the photos are hidden because of McAfee not deleted<br />
&nbsp;<br />
See this from McAfee<br />

&nbsp;<br />
Go to the Control panel and select Folder Options.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Select View.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Select Show hidden files, folder and drives.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The pictures should now be visable.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can unhide them permanently by going to each pictures properties<br />

            <p>If there is a "System Restore" point dated as far back&nbsp;as a month ago the you can use that restore point. Be aware however than any software applications installed in the last month&nbsp;and at least some updates will need to be reinstalled.</p>

<h3> gaerisch  say:</h3>
<h2>            APC Index Mismatch- Windows 10 Pro 64 bit</h2>
                    &nbsp; Ok , I started my PC, but as I was looking at my e-mails my pc went to a blue screen but not a BSOD, a Microsoft regular blue screen that told me there was an problem and Windows needs to restart to fix the problem. It gave me the info on the problem
 as APC Index Mismatch. I looked up this error and suspected from the info that maybe one of my drivers was either poorly written for the Windows 10 upgrade or not up to date. I checked the drivers on all my hardware and updated only my soundcard. It wasn't
 for the driver either. only the software was updated. All my drivers are up to date. I'm not sure what cused the error but I did copy the dmp files from windows just in case I have to call Microsoft on this problem. Has anyone else run into this with Windows
 10 pro 64bit?

            <p>Hi Gaerisch,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your effort towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start the computer in Safe mode.</p>
<p>Please refer the below link to start the computer in Safe mode and check if it fixes the issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The steps for Windows 8.1 applies to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is not occurring in Safe mode then, place the computer in a Clean Boot and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</p>
<p>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. Perform a clean boot on the computer by following the steps given in the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists then follow the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to update the Display adapters driver from the Device Manager and check if it works.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps:<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on Start button and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Select the Graphic driver from the list by extending <strong>Display adapters</strong>.</li><li>Right click on the Graphic driver and click on <strong>Update driver Software</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists then, I would recommend you to download and install the latest video driver for the manufacturer and check if it works.</p>

            I appreciate the quick response, but the problem only occurred once, after which I ran disk check and boot time defragmentation using my diskeeper program. Interestingly, when you run disk check it doesn't give a report after cleaning and checking the
 drive for errors. So I don't know if there are any. But I'll let you know if it happens again. Oddly it's not a regular blue screen. It's just a report screen.

 solution. I've had it on five occasions since I updated to WIndows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have to say that, although it's annoying, it does just dump you back to where you were 5-10 minutes earlier but I'd still like a better way of finding out what driver it is - if that is what is causing the problem.</p>

            <p>I recently started having this problem on my HP EliteBook 8460P, after more than a year running fine with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have the blue screen when I try to use the webcam in SKYPE, that I've been using with no problem since I upgraded the laptop to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Of course I updated all drivers, no change.</p>
<p>Today I even did a 'PC reset', and then I reinstalled only SKYPE... as soon as I tried to run the webcam via this application, the laptop chrashed.</p>
<p>Any suggestion?</p>
<p>Many thanks and Happy Holidays!</p>
