    <title>Movies in moviemaker won&#39;t play when I add music. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zaidordep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movies in moviemaker won&#39;t play when I add music.</h2>
                    <p>I finished a show with movie makers which contains pictures and movies.&nbsp; Everything works fine until I add music to the show. Once I add music the movie parts show nothing and the music doesn't play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Detail:</p>
<p>Everything started once I tried to save the project as a movie.&nbsp; It gave an error and closed the program. Everything failed after that although the last saved project was working music and all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process I followed:&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened the project again and deleted all music.&nbsp; I saved the project and re opened.&nbsp; Once I did this all pictures, effects and movies worked fine. But when I add music again, then the music doesn't play and the movies go blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's interesting is that if I add the music at the very end of the show it plays fine. But once I add music at the beginning , the music at the end dissapears. It seems that it is pushed out into lala land and the show fails again.&nbsp; I believe there may
 be some markers somewhere that go beyond the end of the show which are causing the problem, But I don't know how to analyze this.</p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4b76cb88-7640-4698-885d-01749737b3e7" title="zaidordep">zaidordep</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that the video and audio won't play after adding your music to your Movie Maker project. Let me help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This issue may be caused by unsupported file types, outdated video drivers, or corrupted codecs so to troubleshoot this, we request you to follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A. Check that the files you are using are of a supported format - Some file formats are not supported by Movie Maker. You can read about the list of supported file types in this
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>article</strong></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">B. Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files -Audio and video require codecs to play the file and it‚Äôs important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Try running the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Microsoft FixIt</strong></a> tool for codecs.</li><li>Media info will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether it‚Äôs already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at this
<a href="http://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a>.</li></ul>
<p>Note: If you can't find the codec you need, you may convert the video to a supported format (eg. wmv) and then add it to your Movie Maker project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C. Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date - Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.
 To determine the version and video card driver date, kindly run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button and type <strong><span>dxdiag</span></strong> in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.</li><li>Click on the <strong><span>Display</span></strong> tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</li><li>If your video card driver seems outdated, please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.</li></ol>
<p>If issue persists, please provide us the following information below to isolate your issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the file type of the music that you've added to your project?</li><li>When you tried to save the project as movie, what is the complete error message that you received?</li><li>If you create a new project and add the same music, do you still encounter the same issue?</li><li>What is your operating system?</li><li>What version of Movie Maker is installed in your PC?</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Glenda</p>

            <p>Hi Glenda thanks much for your response.&nbsp; I didn't figure what's causing the problem but I was able to figure a way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the facts as they happened:</p>
<p>1- I created a project that included pictures and movies. (saved the project)</p>
<p>2- I added and edited music to the project.&nbsp; (saved the project)</p>
<p>3- All this time i had not closed the project and re open and everything was playing fine.</p>
<p>4- I tried to save the project as a movie (this takes time) and in the middle of saving it failed.</p>
<p>5- When I re opened the project, the music wouldn't play and the 'movies' in the project wouldn't play.</p>
<p>6- I deleted all the music and saved and closed&nbsp; the project then re open again.</p>
<p>7- The movies were there and it played fine without the music.</p>
<p>8- I added the first track of music and it worked fine.&nbsp; I added the second track and movies and music stopped playing.</p>
<p>9- I re-opened my file without music again. And everything was fine.</p>
<p>10- I added the last track at the bottom of the project and then moved it to the top of the project and it worked fine. Then I started inserting the music thus pushing the last track down.
</p>
<p>11- I was able to insert all music and save as a movie before closing the project so I got a movie that works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the kicker, when I saved , closed and re-opened the project, it wouldn't play the music or the inserted movies. But by this time i already had saved the final product (full movie) in working condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm suspecting that somehow when I was inserting and editing music some 'markers' were created. As I added and deleted music, the markers may have been 'pushed' beyond the end of the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The format of my pictures and songs and movies&nbsp; was pretty standard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again for your inputs.</p>
<p>PJ</p>

            <p>Hello PJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. From the information that you've provided, there's a possibility that the issue is with the Music file. Most likely it is due to the metadata information of the Music file that Movie Maker doesn't recognize.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to verify if you've tried the troubleshooting steps provided by my colleague to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, we would like to ask some information from you for further isolation.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is your Movie Maker build version?</li><li>What operating system are you using?</li><li>What is the file type of the Music file? How many Music file are you trying to add?</li><li>Do they have the same file types?</li><li>Have you tried converting the Music file in to another supported file format?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            Hi Adam,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the description of the query, it seems like when you right click on some icon on the computer, you get a message prompting ‚Äúinstalling shredder 64‚Äù and then gives an error message ‚Äúerror code 1706 shredder‚Äù .</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like gather few information on this issue to help you better:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>2) Is this issue specific with any particular icon on the computer? If it is, then, which is the icon?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It could be some other application or program, which runs at the background, on the computer leading to this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you say that you get this message when you right click on some icon, let's check if you receive the same message when you&nbsp;boot the computer into Clean Boot state.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Please follow the link below to perform clean boot:<br />
<br />
<strong>‚Äú</strong><strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8‚Äù</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>Please go through the section:<strong> How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It could also be an installation issue for shredder 64 application as it states that the dll file is missing.</div>
<div>I would suggest you to register the dll files one by one and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the steps accordingly:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: Register the dll files one by one</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Type <strong>cmd </strong>on start screen.<br />
b. <strong>Right click </strong>on <strong>Command Prompt </strong>and select <strong>
Run as Administrator </strong>from the option on the bottom of the start screen.<br />
c. Type the following commands without quotes and hit<strong> Enter</strong>.<br />
‚ÄúRegsvr32 wuaueng.dll‚Äù<br />
‚ÄúRegsvr32 shell32.dll‚Äù <br />
‚ÄúRegsvr32 jscript.dll‚Äù<br />
‚ÄúRegsvr32 vbscript.dll‚Äù</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Start the Windows Installer service</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Press <strong>Windows and&nbsp;R</strong> key together to open <strong>Run</strong> box.<br />
b. Type <strong>Services.msc </strong>and press "<strong>ENTER</strong>".<br />
b. <strong>Double-click Windows Installer</strong>.<br />
c. Set the Startup type of Windows Installer to <strong>Manual</strong> .<br />
d. Click <strong>Start </strong>to start the service. Note down the error message if any.
<br />
e. Click <strong>OK.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps.

            Hi Adam,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for providing us an update on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to unregister and re-register the Windows Installer. To do so, you can follow the steps:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Type run and click on Run to open the run box.</div>
<div>b) Type MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER in the run box, and then click OK. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c) T<font color="#000000">ype MSIEXEC /REGSERVER in the run box, and then click OK. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass. After you run this command, the operation is
 complete.</font><font color="#000000"> </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Please reply us with the status of this issue.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Feel free to let us know if you need any other assistance on performance issues on windows and we would be more than happy to help you.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the exact same error (1706) and have tried the all of the above options and even double checked and tried them again and i am still having the same issue when i try to right-click most any program. I have uninstalled all Egis Tec programs and still
 am coming up with the error. What do i do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be exact what happens is when i right-click any icon, the installer service starts trying to install shredder, then gives me the message "The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable.&nbsp; Click OK to try again, or enter
 an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package 'Shredder64.msi' in the box below. In the use source box the source listed is C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Downloaded Installations\{D38BBF59-4A97-4AA2-97BF-E37634E5B39D}\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please HELP! Thanks</p>

            I'm now having this problem in Windows 10 when I right click on a folder or just when I click on my folder icon. I didn't have it on my old laptop running Windows 10, but it started soon after using my new laptop. Currently, it has locked up on "please
 wait while Windows configures shredder." It appears this has been an ongoing problem with some people prior to Windows 10. It doesn't resolve with a reboot.

<h2>            DSR won&#39;t work after newest windows 10 pro upgrade</h2>
                    <p>So i use DSR for some of my games to get a little more visible area in my games when only using a 1080p monitor/tv. &nbsp; this hasnt been a problem until the most recent upgrade to windows 10 pro..... i have to turn dsr back on as for some reason windows took
 it upon itself to change my settings without permission..... and now even though i have turned DRS back on and selected only the resolutions i wanted, i still cannot select these resolutions in game anymore... i can manually set the resolution to one of my
 DSR's through the nvidia geforce experience app yet it does nothing as the setting gets overwritten by windows/the game as soon as i load up</p>
<p>
</p><p>makes me want to install linux</p>
<p>
</p><p>does anyone else know the possible causes to this and or a fix?</p>

            My drivers have nothing to do with it .... they are all fully updated &nbsp;with no leftovers from previous drivers ... this didn't happen after an nvidia update ...or a regular windows update ...it happened after the windows upgrade....has happened twice since
 after correcting problem ...... it seems to be at random times chosen by windows&nbsp;

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView. All the minidumps were<br />
checked with DumpCHK and BlueScreenView and all the 2011 ones were checked with<br />
WinDBG.</strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
Bug_Checks are 19, 1A, 24, 3B, D1, and 7E.<br />
<br />
Use the methods such as SFC, CheckDisk, Driver Updates, and others in the troubleshooter referred<br />
to in this link as they will help solve or at least narrow down the issues. After those you can post the<br />
information from BlueScreenView and these other utilities so we can offer more specific advice. Of<br />
course checking with a real computer shop or System Maker's Support would be a good idea however<br />
I would try the possible solutions you can first.</p>
<p>Check this thread for information using BlueScreenView, MyEventViewer and other methods<br />
to troubleshoot BlueScreens - top 3 replies (+1 other).<br />

<p>=================================================================<br />
<br />
1, Many of the Bug_Checks were CAUSE by Windows components which means something else drove them<br />
into Fault.<br />
<br />
2. Some were CAUSE by mfefirek.sys, mfehidk.sys, mfefire.exe and other parts of McAfee so I would uninstall<br />
it and run the McAfee Removal Tool to prevent leaving remnants. Below are recommendations to use while<br />
testing, even better permanently.<br />
<br />
3. Some were CAUSE by MEMORY and it was implicated in a few others.<br />
<br />
4. Some were CAUSE by drivers. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, video driver, and the network<br />
drivers (NIC and WiFi).<br />
<br />
5. After 1-4 run the driver verifier.<br />
<br />
6. Use the other methods as needed in the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
===================================================<br />
<br />
Uninstall McAfee and run the McAfee Removal tool.</p>

<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 recent update in December did not support monitor DELL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikhaillf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 recent update in December did not support monitor DELL 2405FPW  resolution 1920X1200</h2>
                    I did Windows 10 update in December 2017 and it took 1.5 hours and destroyed my monitor DELL2405FPW resolution 1920X1200. Our IT person had attempted to find solution without success and restored it to previous version of Windows 10. Windows 10 has been
 trying to update to new version and it is invasive. It started updating today itself and I had to abrupt installation and restore previous version. Our IT support stated that I had to dump good monitor because no driver available for DELL2405FPW to support
 resolution 1920X1200. I see that some other people experienced similar problems with drivers after Microsoft created new Windows 10 version. I hope there is solution for my issue, because I like my monitor that has been working for me very well. Thank you.

    <title>windows 10 &#40;build 1607&#41; stop automatic reboots after updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikos z  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 &#40;build 1607&#41; stop automatic reboots after updates</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the "anniversary" update, my windows 10 moronically decide to reboot itself whenever it fetches updates. The old way of getting notified before a reboot was removed. I have seen only laborious recommendations that target the reboot task</p>
<p>https://techjourney.net/permanently-disable-prevent-automatic-restart-of-windows-update-in-windows-10/</p>
<p>
</p><p>surely Microsoft should understand that some people do important work on their computers and cannot have all the workspace rebooted without due warning? I am scared to put my laptop to sleep mode because I can never tell when a reboot is pending?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you please put back the warning before reboot so I can at least be mentally prepared that I'll need to reopen 100 windows with whatever I'm doing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>this windows 10 goes from absurd to definitely cantankerous :)</p>

            I also don't have a consistent 12 hour period every day where I'm guaranteed to not be using my computer and have everything open saved. It seems absurd that there is literally no way for me to stop windows from restarting without my express permission.
 I've already lost work files to this. Is there no solution to this horrible UX decision?

            If you are lucky and you don't miss the notification about pending upgrades, you can immediately go into the windows update options, and set a manual update time ("use a custom restart time"). That should buy you a few hours. Not happy but better than
 nothing

            <p>Updates requiring a restart are normally restricted to "patch Tuesday" which is the second Tuesday of the month. Not sure what the official release time is in the US, but in the UK it's shortly after 6pm.&nbsp; So to mitigate this issue, I make a point of going
 to start -&gt; update and security -&gt; check for updates just after 6pm on these days. In this way most of the&nbsp;time W10 needs to restart can be made to happen at this time, when I'm ready for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But otherwise I totally agree that that's an unwelcome change that we're not given the chance to save work before rebooting.

<p>I don't think Microsoft wants to show items with a high upvote count that disagree with their direction for Windows which is to completely control the user's machine remotely.</p>

<p>If Windows 7 came preinstalled (Dell, HP, etc),&nbsp; Key Finder Programs used on preinstalled Operating Systems only find the Manufacturer's Product Key which was used on multiple machines during manufacture and what they find is not suitable to use for a reinstall:</p>

</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it came preinstalled and the product key is erased/worn on the COA sticker:</p>

<p>Or&nbsp;take a photo of it&nbsp;and enlarge it on the screen.</p>

<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available (<strong>Most don't</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you received&nbsp;your&nbsp;Laptop there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how&nbsp;it was when new.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive and you can Boot into Windows, you should be able to make your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System in case of Hard Drive failure.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><em>The above reinstallation methods do not&nbsp;normally require you to supply a Product Key during the Installation Process as the Manufacturers&nbsp;Recovery Process uses the Factory Installation Product Key to automatically Activate during the reinstallation

</p><p>If there is a COA sticker on your laptop, it came with Windows pre-installed.&nbsp; Most computer manufacturers that pre-install Windows provide a means to restore the computer to ex-factory condition by using a hidden partition on the system's hard drive.&nbsp; Doing
 this does not require the use of a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't use this built-in mechanism, your computer's manufacturer may&nbsp; -- but probably will not -- be able to provide you with a set of "recovery disks" that you can use to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; You should not need the product key in connection with using
 these disks.</p>

                    Just downloaded 1903 to my LapTop today. All is well with the 1903 - 64bit. Except I don't have BlueTooth. So where do I go to download 1903 BlueTooth for my Windows 10 - 64 LapTop? Thanks.

            Often you can get missing drivers from the web site of the hardware manufacturer, either the PC manufacturer or the Bluetooth adapter's manufacturer. Have you checked those two places?

            Hi Loy
<br />
<br />Most likely that update has installed an incompatible Bluetooth device driver on your system, your best option is to go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website and from there download and install the Bluetooth driver they recommend
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty locating the support page, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

            It‚Äôs a known bug in ver 1903:
<br />Unable to discover or connect to Bluetooth devices
<br />Microsoft has identified compatibility issues with some driver versions for Bluetooth radios made by Realtek and Qualcomm. To safeguard your update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with affected driver versions for Realtek or Qualcomm Bluetooth radios from being offered Windows 10, version 1903 or Windows Server, version 1903 until the driver has been updated.
<br />
<br />Affected platforms:
<br />Client: Windows 10, version 1903
<br />Server: Windows Server, version 1903
<br />Workaround: Check with your device manufacturer (OEM) to see if an updated driver is available and install it.
<br />
<br />For Qualcomm drivers, you will need to install a driver version greater than 10.0.1.11.
<br />For Realtek drivers, you will need to install a driver version greater than 1.5.1011.0.
<br />Note Until an updated driver has been installed, we recommend you do not attempt to manually update using the Update now button or the Media Creation Tool. 
<br />
<br />Next steps: Microsoft is working with Realtek and Qualcomm to release new drivers for all affected system via Windows Update.

<p>I can confirm that Windows 10 Version 1903 breaks bluetooth if&nbsp; you are using a Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4. Even a rollback to the previous version of Windows 10 - does NOT resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>So it looks like a <em>triple</em> fail by MS here:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Insufficient hardware testing.</span><br />
<span>2. Update block (for PCs with affected devices) did not work.</span><br />

<p>What's the status on this?</p>

<p>same in here too.. amazing a bug that happen on june 2019 and until now at october 2019 nothing fixed.... i am using lenovo z400 touch with atheros bluetooth and just yesterday windows prompt me with big annoying button to update to this version!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>now my old but still functional laptop that i turn into and home media center is completely useless without bluetooth audio!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thankfully i am not using windows anymore for my main workstation... even thought mac/apple not the best or perfect but atleast i never experience something as trivial as this issue,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>forcing people to update to something that is broken..... if only my lenovo can work fine or at least have driver for windows 7....</p>
<p>
</p><p>my fixed:</p>
<p>i just uninstall the driver installed on device manager (don't forget to tick delete files too) and doing restart and suddenly it reinstall old driver and working fine now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>really microsoft!! i love surface but the only thing that prevent me from buying that is WINDOWS!! Mac is completely far ahead of windows when dealing with this update and so on, even the troubled catalina (32bit apps problem) is still much much better that
 this!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>shame on you microsoft!! no wonder windows phone is dead... someday windows is gonna dead if nothing is changed</p>

            Um thanks, Javaid well, this seems like a similar problem but what I did was a little different. I had restarted several times and that did not seem to help. But what I did was, logged in into safe mode (by msconfig) and tried to change the settings and
 this time bingo! But I wanted that password request to be disable so I went to user profiles and deleted all sorts of previous profiles I had made and left only the current one. After the restart there were no password request nor any sort of problems in changing
 any setting.. I wonder whether it was the deleting of profiles or the restart that help.

            <p>Probably what you need is a "USB to Firewire Adapter" and you can do a web search for those.&nbsp; Amazon.com does have them and you may need to shop around and double check the specifications for them before buying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a web link to get you started: http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=usb+to+firewire+adapter&amp;tag=mh0b-20&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=33335150&amp;ref=pd_sl_3txbx36p4t_e</p>
<p>
</p><p>These connect to the USB port on the computer and provide a Firewire connection.&nbsp; They will most likely have a driver disk that goes along with them and may be needed if Windows does not recognize the device.&nbsp; Since you don't have a DVD drive, copy the files
 from the installation disk onto a micro-SD card and when you insert the adapter, run the "setup" program located on the micro-SD card and it should install the driver suite for the adapter.</p>

<h2>            After downloading Google Chrome I am unable to open attachments in my otherTiscali  email account</h2>
                    I am unable to open any old or new attachments from my Tiscali email account. I seems to coincide with my downloading Google Chrome. I have been in touch with Microsoft Support but cannot really understand the way they say to resolve the problem. They
 say that they need to delete the account and then I suppose I need to recreate. Being a novice at all of this I am not sure of what to do or any implications in doing it. Has anyone else had this problem and how was it resolved. I can open attachments in my
 gmail account.

<h2>            Unable to reset difficulty on microsoft solitaire games</h2>
                    <p>Hello--</p>
<p>I really like Spider Solitaire on Microsoft. My usual level is Expert, but I played a few in Grandmaster, and now it defaults to that level automatically. How can I change it back to give myself a choice again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>In the top left corner, there's three horizontal lines with Menu under them. Click that, and go to game options at the top. Scroll down to the bottom of the options and you should see choices for "Remember Deck Difficulty" - just change that to Off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I think you need to play another game, and then go back and change that to Yes - assuming you want it to default to Expert.&nbsp; Not 100% sure about this part though.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm what Ackis said to turn off "Remember Deck Difficulty". Launch a new game,&nbsp; then select the difficulty you want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to stick with that difficulty moving forward each time, go back into the menu and turn "Remember deck difficulty" back on. The game will launch at that difficultly the next time you play. If you want to choose the difficulty each time, leave
 it off.</p>

<p>I turned off the remember deck difficulty, played a game, closed out, then started up a new game a few moments later.&nbsp; It didn't give me a choice of difficulty levels.&nbsp; Just immediately started playing - apparently always at random play (I liked playing
 solvable or switching things out to medium, hard, expert and the like.&nbsp; How do you get to where you can see those choices?</p>
