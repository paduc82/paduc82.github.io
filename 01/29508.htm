            <p>if the copy you have came pre-installed in your laptop then contact your computer manufacturer for a replacement key. If that is a retail key, you may call Microsoft Customer Service for a replacement key:

<h2>            can&#39;t do a system restore windows 8.1 pro</h2>
                    i have read over the post and none of these are helpful, i have tried everything. sfc shows that there are some corrupt files that can not be repaired, namely ms.net maybe corrupt and needs to be repaired, well when i go to get the ms.net repair tool nothing
 happens it will not download. and when i try to do a windows restore i get the error message that invalid media. i went to ms and bought windows 8 pro on-line and i made recovery media, but i didn't when i upgraded to windows 8.1 so now my restore media is
 invalid and my windows 8 pro disk that i made shows that it is invalid when trying to do a system restore with it. so if i reinstall windows 8 pro i'm i going to have to shell out another 119$ again? i believe that my hard drive is getting ready to crash,
 and i want to replace the faulty hard drive and do a clean reinstall of windows 8 pro, is that possible? any info is welcome

            <p>Hello Wallace,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
2. What is the reason of performing system restore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also appreciate this fact that you created a recovery media when Windows 8 was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you replace your hard drive and reinstall Windows, I would suggest you to
<strong>create a USB recovery drive again and then try to perform system restore.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Create a USB recovery drive</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important Notes: <br />
Creating a recovery drive will erase anything already stored on your USB flash drive. Use an empty USB flash drive or make sure to transfer any important data from your USB flash drive to another storage device before using it to create a USB recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use system restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also see:<br />

<p>
</p><p>Note: Please <strong>do not </strong>refresh or reset Windows at present.</p>

<h2>            Mail App problems Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having problems with the Mail App (Windows 10), basically one of my accounts wouldn't receive mail. I attempted to delete the account but the 'Delete Account' option was missing from the 'Manage Account' window. I assumed there must be a problem
 with the app so I uninstalled the app using the info here---&gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail/windows-10-mail-app-not-working/90e5ccca-c5cc-4222-9a7d-c6798dfd37a3?page=~pagenum~">Link</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the laptop and opened the 'Store' app to reinstall the Mail App but it says the app is already installed so I checked the other account on the laptop and sure enough the mail app is still there but I can't access it on my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know what's going on...........................?</p>

            <p>Hi Abdul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the Troubleshooter didn't pick up any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above I can access the Mail App on the other users account but can't from mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is how can the app be on the PC if I uninstalled it, the other users account can open the app and the 'Store' says it's already installed but I can't access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>I managed to download a Windows 10 App Remover and it successfully uninstalled the Mail App, of which I was able to reinstall from the 'Store'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm back to square one as I can't delete an email account (which isn't receiving mail) from the app as there is no delete button for this particular email account.</p>

            <p>I had a problem with Windows 10 Mail app as well.&nbsp; Last week it worked, this week it stopped downloading/sync incoming email.&nbsp; I could&nbsp;create and send email but not receive/sync incoming email.&nbsp; After two days and many hours each day on the Microsoft chat
 with a level 1 tech we couldn't resolve the issue.&nbsp; On the third day with a level 2 tech we solved my problem.&nbsp; I was receiving an error code 0x80048830.&nbsp; Both level 1 and 2 tech were told this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes into the discussion&nbsp;with the level 2, he said it
 was my eSet anti-virus software that was blocking the sync operation.&nbsp; My eSet software automatically installs the latest virus software.&nbsp; The latest update to eSet&nbsp;doesn't play well with Windows 10 Mail app.&nbsp; THIS COST $99 to find out.&nbsp; We turned off the
 email protection in&nbsp;the eSet software setup and&nbsp;email downloaded without a problem.&nbsp; We also found out that other virus protection software was having the same issues.&nbsp; It is upsetting that a level 1 tech didn't have the answer.&nbsp; Again, after five minutes
 with the level 2 and $99 later he had the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>&#34;Failed Redundancy&#34; RAID mirror in Windows 7 32 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rev doug  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Failed Redundancy&#34; RAID mirror in Windows 7 32 bit</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer running Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit.&nbsp; MS Office 2010 crashes sometimes while opening an excel document and I get a "not responding."&nbsp; I am unable to end the process through task manager. it says its going to end it but it never does.
 so I shutdown and after several minutes it finally shuts down.&nbsp; when I reboot my two mirrored drives are gone1&nbsp; It does not show the disks at all in disk management. If I shutdown again then turn the pc on. they are back. Here is the problem. when I go into
 Disk management it says "failed redundancy" both disks are back and are online.&nbsp; It did this once a week ago and disk management said resynching, this time it says failed redundancy.&nbsp; I am mirroriny two 1tb seagate drives. Model numbers are identical and are
 both brand new.&nbsp; I am using windows 7 software to setup the raid. I am NOT using any type of hardware or bios raid.&nbsp; I am worried that my data is only saving to one drive now, and how wouyld I know which one it is saving to.&nbsp; I have not tried breaking the
 mirror or reactivating or anything seeing as I am unsure what happens to the data on the drive that I would be messing with. Thank you for any help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s. One more thing. I am not sure if this is relevant or not but. prior to posting this the two drives where Disk 0 and Disk 4 according to Disk Management. After I posted this I shut my pc fully down then started it back up and logged in to see if the
 failed redundancy went away. It didn't, however it is now reporting the two drives as Disk 1 and Disk 2?&nbsp; I thought disk ID was determined by how the drives where plugged into the sata ports on the motherboard?&nbsp; Just wondering.&nbsp; thanks</p>

            <p>If you brake the raid the data *should* be still intact</p>
<p>Personnally I've seen too many problems with raid implimented by win, or by using the onboard&nbsp;motherboard raid controller, and as such the only way I would imlpliment raid is by using a third party hardware raid card. A decent one will cost a significant
 sum (more than your motherboard)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since to impliment software raid your drives will have been converted to Dynamic, theres no win/ms inbuilt method of converting to Basic without losing the data.</p>
<p>Third party partition managers can accomplish this.</p>
<p>Is the PSU upto the load?&nbsp;a low spec psu can cause all sorts of HD issues.</p>
<p>PS mirror raid is not an alternative to backups of data, even when running mirror raid systems with a 3rd fall back drive connected, I still had seperate data backups on external locations</p>

            <p>Hi...you should have buttons on the monitor to adjust the settings like the 'Auto setting'...</p>
<p>Why you would use some other software for this kind of common settings performance is beyond me ...I used to repair monitors and TV's.</p>
<p>You can try to uninstall that software and restart the Monitor....and reset to 'Auto' ..</p>
<p>Hopefully it will go back to where it used to be...then you can just use the monitor settings to adjust bios and brightness , contrast ,&nbsp; size...etc etc...

    <title>Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 ultimate using Full - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> osm101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 ultimate using Full retail DVD&#47;licence</h2>
                    I am going to buy a new PC with Win 7 Home Premium (64-bit) installed.<br />
I own a <span style="font-weight: bold">full boxed retail</span> version of Win 7 Ultimate (64-bit) that I would like to upgrade to when the new PC arrives.
<br />
<br />
Will I be able to upgrade to Win 7 ultimate using this retail DVD/licence or will I need to do a clean install?<br />
I would prefer to upgrade. Please provide suitable links or step-by-step instructions if this is possible.<br />
<br />
Also, my copy of Win 7 ultimate is currently installed on my old PC. I know I will need to uninstall/deactivate it, but does this need to be done before I install it on the new PC? I would prefer a window of a few days where they can be installed on the 2 machines
 at the same time so that I have time to transfer my data over to the new pc and establish if I am happy with it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you know the name of the codec or its ID (known as a <span>FourCC identifier</span> for video codecs or a<span>WaveFormat identifier</span> for audio codecs), try searching the Internet. For example, you can often go to a codec manufacturer's website
 to download the most recent version of a codec.</p>

<div>
Warning
<p>However, use caution when installing codecs that you find on the Internet, particularly some of the free codec packs that claim to include codecs from a wide variety of companies or organizations. Incompatibilities are known to exist with some of the components
 in these codec packs that can cause serious playback issues in the Player and other players, lead to system corruption, and make it difficult for Microsoft Support to diagnose and troubleshoot playback issues. For these reasons, we strongly discourage you
 from installing these codec packs, and recommend that you remove them if you have installed them and you're having problems with the Player. Install only codecs, filters, or plug-ins from trusted, authorized sources, such as the website of the official supplier.
 Even then, use caution: many codec suppliers offer minimal customer support. Before installing any digital media components, set a system restore point. The restore point enables you to return to your original system configuration, if necessary</p>

    <title>EapHost Error 2002 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesnoteman  say:</h3>
<h2>            EapHost Error 2002</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit on an Auau k56by Laptop using
</p>
<p>an Atheros AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter. The driver I am using is from the Asus</p>
<p>Help and support website, and its version information is:</p>
<p>Driver&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;c:\windows\system32\drivers\athrx.sys (9.2.0.427, 2.63 MB (2,753,536 bytes), 27/06/2011 12:37 AM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check my system logs, (event viewer -&gt; windows logs -&gt; application)</p>
<p>I have three errors:</p>
<p>Error: EapHost 2002 peer</p>
<p>Skipping: Eap method DLL path name validation failed. Error: typeId=43, authorId=9, vendorId=0, vendorType=0</p>
<p>The other two are the same, except that the "typeId" is 25 and 17.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tracked the problem to three registry entries:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\EapHost\Methods\9\17 <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\EapHost\Methods\9\25 <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\EapHost\Methods\9\43<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They relate to three files that are not installed:</p>
<p>c:\Program Files(x86)\Cisco\Cisco LEAP Module\CiscoEapLeap.dll<br />
@c:\Program Files(x86)\Cisco\Cisco LEAP Module\CiscoEapLeap.dll,-117<br />
<br />
09 -25<br />
c:\Program Files(x86)\Cisco\Cisco PEAP Module\CiscoEapPeap.dll,-119<br />
@c:\Program Files(x86)\Cisco\Cisco PEAP Module\CiscoEapPeap.dll,-119<br />
<br />
09 - 43<br />
c:\Program Files(x86)\Cisco\Cisco EAP-FAST Module\CiscoEapFast.dll<br />
@c:\Program Files(x86)\Cisco\Cisco EAP-FAST Module\CiscoEapFast.dll,-30119</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that I do not have Cisco installed on my computer. I dont know if it was left be hind by some other program, and
</p>
<p>there does not seem to be any conectivity problems - My wireless addaptor connects just fine to networks I join such as my wireless wi-fi modem.</p>
<p>I am wondering if it is safe to remove these entries as they point to non-existant software - or if anyone knows where to get the Cisco</p>
<p>software that is missing (and what that software may have been)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice would be welcome.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            MISSING Xbox One Day One Achievement &#40;Possible Fix&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Issue: &nbsp; &nbsp;Day One Achievement and Background UNLOCKED one 11/22/2013 But Missing Since NXOE Update 2014</p>
<p>Cause: Achievement is Listed Under Apps and Other which under the new Dashboard are not searchable unless you have that app running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the Achievement is not for an App but just a stand alone achievement it is lost.</p>

<p>Possible Fix: Reclassify the Achievement under games so it is searchable again by those who had unlocked it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Deathlok OG</p>

<p>most likely a change to the achievement system has caused this to not display under any category. &nbsp;there are other games/apps that have the same issue not displaying on various consoles/platforms or xbox.com. &nbsp;you can verify whether this achievement is indeed
 still unlocked on your gamertag by going to TrueAchievements.com and adding your account. &nbsp;you would be able to see it here:</p>

<p>of course i understand that's not the point. &nbsp;it is nice to be able to display it as a part of your XBOX Displayed Achievements. &nbsp;unfortunately there's not much you can do other than requesting this be changed at
<a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.uservoice.com/</a> &nbsp;but perhaps a forum staff member will see this post and direct the issue to someone who can look into it more.</p>

<h3> supersh  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make Windows 10 select ONLY the filename when hitting F2</h2>
                    Is there a way to make Windows 10 select only the filename and not the extension under the Windows Explorer when I want to rename the file using F2 key? If not a setting, maybe a Registry edit? This is annoying having to select just the filename when you
 just want to rename a video or picture file.&nbsp;

            Hi SuperSH, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />There's no way to make it select only the filename other than hiding file extensions.
<br />
<br />You can do this in File Explorer by clicking the View tab, then deselecting the checkbox labeled "File name extensions".
<br />
<br />Once you've done this, you won't see the file extensions in the filenames, and pressing F2 will only select the filename to change.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

                    We’re using your copy of Windows Small Business Server 2003.&nbsp; We’re using it temporarily – it’s installed on a laptop to help us migrate to Windows Server 2008 R2 but we need more than 30 days – peharps another 2 weeks&nbsp; to be safe.&nbsp; How can we reset or
 re-arm the 30 trial?&nbsp; We cannot activate on this laptop since it is already activated on the old existing server.

            First of all, why are you asking a Windwos Server question in a Windows XP forum?<br />
<br />
Second of all, you aren't talking to Microsoft. This is a peer-to-peer forum.<br />
<br />
Third of all, there is only one trial of any software allowed on a computer. Nothing can be extended, re-armed, or rest.<br />
<br />
Third of all, it's not even a trial. There are no trials for Windows 2003, which has been superceded by 2008. It simply means you can't use if after 30 days without activing.<br />
<br />
After 30 days, its dead in the water.<br />

                    <p>Dear Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 looks fine, but the search function does not work properly on my Workstation (Fujitsu M720). When I search for 'Color Management' a few items appear in cortana (in the search result list) - under settings -&nbsp;but these items are not clickable. When
 I do this on my laptop clicking these items works fine. Spent hours in order to fix this. On the wedge to go back to windows 7&nbsp;where everything works fine.

            <p>Thank you for your quick answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occurs when I try to select one of the results either with the mouse or by highlighting the the item with the keyboard and pressing enter - nothing happens. And this only happens for the items in the 'Settings' category&nbsp; and some of the items
 under category&nbsp; 'Best Match'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example. I click on the start menu icon, and start typing 'Col' - up comes a fine list with the categories:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Best Match</strong></p>
<p>Color Picker </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desktop App</p>
<p>Color Management</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Panel</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Apps</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Solitaire Collection</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>Calibrate Display Color</p>
<p>Color Settings</p>
<p>Choose Your Accent Color</p>
<p>....etc</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<p>College Board</p>
<p>Colorado Lottery</p>
<p>...etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click Color Picker, this application starts. If I click Color Management, nothing happens. If I click Microsoft Solitaire Collection, the program starts. No matter what item I click under Settings, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed Your advise and did the scan sfc/scannow, no errors found (no integrity violations)</p>
<p>So I still have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might have found something, that might help you helping me. I am using a system with microsofts bootmanager</p>
<p>on a 500GB SSD disk. This disk is&nbsp; divided into 4 partitions - 2 primary and one extended. In the extended partition there are&nbsp; 2 partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first prim partition - Windows 10 is installed with all my office and color things open office xrite etc.</p>
<p>On the second prim partition - Windows 10 is installed with all my programming things visual studio etc</p>
<p>On the first logical drive in the extended partition - Windows 7 is installed with a lot of sony film editing software .
</p>
<p>On the second logical drive in the extended partition - Data resides for fast SSD access.</p>
<p>(This config has worked perfectly and boots fine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I made a clean rebuild of Windows 10 on the second primary partition - A build with all needed software. And to my surprise everything worked - including the search function, where I could pick and click on everything and it worked !
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I then made a ghost (disk image) with paragon disk manager version 15, and saved this perfect image for later use. This rebuild actually was my 'Office/Color build' which should reside on the first primary partition.&nbsp; Therefore I restored the image&nbsp; to
 the first primary partition. </p>
<p>Having done this, the system now has two identical Windows 10 installations on primary partition 1 and 2. Everything boots fine and looks good. but the restored partition has&nbsp; the initial problem - as described above. Has this something to do with some identity
 issue of the disk versus the installed windows 10 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working happily with this way of organizing my workstation for a long time - with windows 7. I would like to do the same with Windows 10.
</p>
