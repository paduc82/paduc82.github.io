<p>I have recently purchased a new laptop with windows 10 and trying to load some of the software that I have enjoyed using on my old laptop, only to find that none of them now run, I am trying to run some of my old PC games such as DOOM 1 and 2, but not to
 my surprise they do not run in windows 10, when the creators of this product wrote this programmes they would have realised that many older programmes would be rendered obsolete, its bad enough that we no longer physically own any software, the software we
 do physically own is being gradually phased out, Windows 10 has not improved my experience whatsoever, in fact it will cost me more to try and update my existing software but I wont have and discs.</p>
<p>Rant over</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Trackpad problem in all of Windows. Moving slightly, and then clicking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jermerf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trackpad problem in all of Windows. Moving slightly, and then clicking jumps the cursor back to the original spot and then &#39;triggers&#39; the click.</h2>
                    So I've had the problem for years, on many different brands of laptop and on many different models. I'm wondering if this a fundamental problem in how Windows handles trackpads or if it has to do with synaptic trackpad drivers or something but I find this
 incredibly irritating.<br />
<br />
The type of trackpads I'm using are ones where you can move the mouse by moving your finger on the trackpad and click either by removing and tapping your finger or push down for hardware click.<br />
<br />
So, when you're just doing what you do with a laptop and you are moving the mouse with with the trackpad, occasionally this will happen. You want to click on something that is a few pixels away from where the mouse is right now. So you move the mouse to the
 target and then click by pressing down the trackpad to trigger the hardware click. What happens if you do this just right is, when you click, the mouse jumps back to the original position, before you moved the mouse and registers the click as having been at
 that original location.<br />
<br />
At first I thought it was intermittent which would mean it's next to impossible to replicate, but I think I've got the technique down for triggering it. You have to do a pretty quick move-then-click and it'll happen. I can do this with one or two fingers, one
 moving the mouse, the other pressing down for the click.<br />
<br />
What I think is going on is that this is a "feature" rather than a bug. Say you want to click but your hand isn't on the trackpad. If you want to click the mouse right where it is with the hardware click, you would have to put your finger on the trackpad and
 push down and that would trigger a click. The "Feature" part I would imagine is this: when you put your finger onto the trackpad to do the click, if your finger moves a bit accidentally before the hardware click is triggered then the mouse will have moved
 little and clicked in that slightly moved location. This "feature" is to ignore the slight movement and register the click in the original location.<br />
<br />
If that's the case, I want that not to happen. I know where I want the mouse to be and I have good enough control to move the mouse where I want, or alternately, I can accept that I might accidentally move the mouse a little before it clicks.<br />
<br />
What's a little irritating is I want to move the mouse from here -&gt;|&lt;- to here -&gt;|&lt;- and click, but because of this quirk the move was ignored and I now I've clicked in the original spot. What's most irritating is how, semi often, this will happen two, three
 even four times IN A ROW. So I've clicked several times in the wrong location because the mouse refused to move.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this? Because like I said, different brands of laptops all have this problem. I can tell you at least Dell, Lenovo and Asus laptops. I teach and these are the laptops we have and I go around class helping students for hours a day and this
 problem will happen every single day at least once.

    <title>Unable to reformat PC Error code&#58; 0x80070241 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicktraeger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to reformat PC Error code&#58; 0x80070241</h2>
                    <p>This will be my 4th post on this site I believe and yet I have not been able to fix my issues.&nbsp; So, I have not been able to complete any windows updates for the past 2 months.&nbsp; I currently have 17 updates that continually fail.&nbsp; Yes, I have attempted every
 fix and or troubleshoot without success.&nbsp; So skip this, I don't feel like dealing with this any longer all I want to do now is just perform a clean install and remove everything on my PC to start from scratch because I can't deal with this anymore.&nbsp; Well,
 I am unable to even reformat.&nbsp; Now, probably 8 months ago I was able to perform a reformat without issue now I keep receiving the above mentioned error code each and every time I attempt to perform an install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I took:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I insert my alienware windows 7 install disk and run it.&nbsp; The only option that I have at this point is to choose my language.&nbsp; Next screen allows to install language, time and location, and keyboard.&nbsp; Clicked next.&nbsp; Only option on the following screen is
 to install now, only other clickable option is "What to know before installing."&nbsp; Clicked install now.&nbsp; Next screen options are to go online to get updates or not to go online.&nbsp; I go online to get updates and this completes at 100%.&nbsp; Next screen gives me the
 uption to upgrade or perform clean install.&nbsp; I choose to perform clean install which then begins but ends with the error code I listed above with the message "Windows cannot copy files required for installation.&nbsp; The files may be corrupt or missing.&nbsp; Make
 sure all files required for installation are available and restart the installation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to download my version of windows from Microsoft, copied this to a Flash Drive and attempt the install this way without success.&nbsp; What are my options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also mention that right before I am able to start the installation for a clean install I am told that the partitions or something are out of order and mentions GPT.&nbsp; Regardless of this message, I have already completed a full reinstall of windows
 about 8 months ago without issue.&nbsp; Why would this now be giving me issues?</p>

<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 not charging</h2>
                    <p>I was using my surface pro the other day and I noticed that the power had gotten down to less than 6%, so i plugged it in to charge. However it does not seem to be charging, even though the charge light is on. I even left it over night and nothing. &nbsp;The
 battery has now drained even more to the point that when I try to turn it on the surface logo shows and then the low battery symbol then it turns off, meaning it needs to be charged.</p>
<p>

    <title>Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect to Burnout Paradise servers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spookyhurst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect to Burnout Paradise servers</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having a rather strange problem. I just bought Burnout Paradise and the DLC. When I started the game, it said that I could not connect to the servers. I tried a variety of fixes (plugging my console directly into the modem, deleting the update and redownloading
 it, deleting my profile and redownloading it, clearing the cache 3 times), and nothing worked. On a whim, I tried playing with a different profile on the console. Initially the game gave me the same message about not being able to connect to the servers, but
 when I tried to join an online freeburn, it worked! I went back to my first profile, and it still can't connect to the servers. I went over to EA's website and did a chat with support, and they couldn't figure it out either. They had me disable cloud saves,
 and they checked to make sure that my gametag was linked (it was), but I still can't connect. I can play all other games online, including EA games like Need for Speed Most Wanted, so it's perplexing why I can't connect.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a problem like this?</p>

<p>Hi Spooky,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the profile/server troubles. Let's see what we can do. <br />
<br />
 If so, let's go ahead and delete those.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If not, we may want to delete any and all data related to this game, and then give it another shot.
<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There weren't any yellow exclamations, but I went ahead and deleted everything Burnout related from my console (game saves, DLC, updates). I also deleted my profile again, cleared the cache, and restarted my Xbox. I redownloaded my profile, and only downloaded
 the required update (I skipped the DLC just in case it was a problem). Unfortunately, I still cannot connect to the Burnout servers.

<p>Nope, I'm not having any other online troubles. I've tried playings other EA games, and I connect to the servers fine.</p>
<p>My modem is a Motorola SB6141, and my router is a Netgear WNDR4000. I've tried connecting my Xbox directly to the modem, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>I tried moving my profile to a USB drive. I then deleted my save file again, cleared the cache, and restarted my Xbox. I still couldn't connect to the Burnout servers.

<p>Hey spooky,<br />
<br />
I've been doing some digging on this and the only thing I could find pointed to a possible issue with the update.<br />
<br />
You might want to try deleting the update (or even the game as well) and then redownloading to a USB drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know you said you already spoke with EA support, but since this is just happening with this one game, I would recommend
<a href="https://help.ea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">getting back in touch</a> with them about troubleshooting the connection to those servers.</p>

<p>I tried putting the update on a USB drive. However, when I started the game, it gave me the following message: "You have a Paradise Update that is not on the Xbox 360 Hard Drive. To use it you must move it to your Xbox 360 Hard Drive."</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice though! I'll try contacting EA again, but at this point, I don't know what else could possibly be done. I really wish I had tried the game out BEFORE I purchase the DLC.</p>

<strong>Let us know how contacting EA goes</strong>. Other than that, I may recommend reaching out to

<p>I called EA yesterday. Very friendly people! The first person ran through a bunch of stuff, but none of it worked. Then she escalated me to higher support. He tried a bunch of stuff too, and even went and asked someone familiar with Burnout for ideas. Nothing
 worked. They said they would send a message to someone who worked on Burnout back in the day to see if they had any ideas, but since it's an old game, they couldn't guarantee anything. I hope they can figure it out!</p>

<p>MS Higher Support downloaded my profile onto one of their Xboxs and confirmed that there was something within my profile that kept it from connecting to the servers. The support person said there was nothing they could do about it. I'd like to pursue this
 further. Is there anyone beyond higher support that could fix this issue? I'm worried that if there is a bug in my profile, it may lead to more problems down the line. A friend of mine suggested that MS could perhaps make a new profile, and just dump all of
 my info (achievements, game licenses, gold subscription, MS points) into it. Is that even a possibility?

<h2>            Windows Update has not worked for a year</h2>
                    <p>My husband was complaining that his computer was slow, so I took a look and found that since March 2011, he has only had a couple of successful Windows Updates.&nbsp; Almost all have failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran Fixit Default but did not run Aggressive yet because of all the warnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's got a ton of unused disk space, so that's not it.&nbsp;I've tried running one at a time but each one fails.&nbsp; I've searched&nbsp;for information regarding failed updates but the
 suggestions (to other people) don't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could give you more information but where to start?&nbsp; The codes are all different, but I can give you any codes that you want.&nbsp; And if we get this working again, how do I get a year's worth of missed updates?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has Windows Vista Home Premium SP1, security is Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Firewall.&nbsp; (I think it's still SP1 because SP2 is one of the missed updates.)&nbsp; I hope that this is something simple. Thank you for your help.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Support for Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) ended on <em>Tuesday, 12 July 2011</em>.</strong> Computers still running Vista SP1 "will no longer receive software updates [i.e., updates released after 12 July 2011
<em>so&nbsp;hubby's computer is&nbsp;now at least seven months behind on critical security updates!</em> ] from Windows Update" until SP2 has been installed (which will require that several Prerequisite Updates be installed first).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ What does it mean if my version of Windows is no longer supported?<br />

</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>That being said, please answer <em>all of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. When (approx. date) did your hubby&nbsp;purchase the computer?</p>
<p>2a. Was MSE offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did&nbsp;he intentionally <em>
choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>2b. In Windows Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder</em>
</p>
<p>Select <strong>Properties</strong>: What is the <strong>Created</strong> date displayed on the resulting
<strong>General</strong> tab?</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before&nbsp;hubby installed</em> <em>
MSE</em>, was the subscription still current, and did&nbsp;he uninstall it before&nbsp;he installed MSE?</p>
<p>4. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when&nbsp;hubby&nbsp;bought it? (Doesn't matter if&nbsp;he never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. Why wasn't SP2 installed <em>years ago? </em></p>
<p>7. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;Is hubby&nbsp;in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; CCleaner)?</p>

            <p>If you read my first message, I said that the sp2 update did not run because it is one of the updates that failed.&nbsp; That is why I mentioned it.&nbsp; The reason I mentioned this was that I know sp1 is no longer supported.&nbsp; Since the problem is failed updates,
 this is a catch-22.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I don't know when <em>hubby</em> bought the computer.</p>
<p>2a.&nbsp; I installed MSE last year before Avira Antivir Premium&nbsp;expired.</p>
<p>2b.&nbsp; Sunday, â€ŽJune â€Ž12, â€Ž2011</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Avira Antivir&nbsp;was installed.&nbsp; The subscription was still current when I installed MSE.&nbsp; I uninstalled Avira early because I found that MSE was faster on my PC and since the subscription was running out, I went ahead and
<em>installed it for hubby</em>.&nbsp; I uninstalled Avira first.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Since this is an Acer, my guess is that it had a Norton free trial but never installed.&nbsp; McAfee may have been installed because that was what our ISP offered.&nbsp; I got Avira because McAfee was problematic.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; See above.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I don't know why sp2 wasn't installed "<em>years ago</em>."&nbsp; As I stated, this is not my machine.&nbsp; I didn't know there was a problem with updates.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 and I don't think about what Vista is up to.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Firefox is installed, Chrome is not.&nbsp; He uses IE.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; No, hubby doesn't touch the registry and does not do any type of maintenance, which is probably why there is a problem now.&nbsp; He thought that his updates were installing because it always said they were installing.&nbsp; He never noticed that they failed.</p>

            <p>Working backwards in time: MSE was installed on 21 June 2011 according to your answer 2b. If the AntiVir subscription was about to expire, it must have been installed in late June or early July 2010 (or possibly 2009), after you'd installed&nbsp;the "problematic"&nbsp;McAfee
 freebie from your ISP.</p>
<p>Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling cleanly.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>1. Did you or your husband&nbsp;(a) uninstall the McAfee application AND THEN (b) download/run the
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</a> &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE&nbsp;Avira AntiVir was&nbsp;installed?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Which, if any,&nbsp;of the following updates <em>ARE&nbsp;listed</em> in <strong>View installed updates</strong> (<em>not</em> Update History)? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ KB2555917, KB2507938; KB2530548, KB2544521, KB2544893, KB2476490, KB2535512, KB2393802 &amp; KB971029 [2]</p>
<p>3. Can you successfully update Microsoft Security Essentials manually via the UPDATE button on the UPDATE tab? [YES/NO]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Comment: If a Norton <em>or a&nbsp;McAfee</em> free-trial was&nbsp;preinstalled on the computer and the free-trialware was NOT uninstalled
<em>and/or</em> the appropriate removal tool was NOT run, chances are that neither the ISP freebie nor AntiVir nor even&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials ever&nbsp;installed or worked properly.</p>

    <title>lost internet connection after installing vista sp2, only local - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulzed  say:</h3>
<h2>            lost internet connection after installing vista sp2, only local network</h2>
                    <p>After installing SP2 on Vista Home Premium my ACER laptop cannot access the internet with either wired or wireless connections.&nbsp; I have a cable wireless modem / router provided by the cable service provider.&nbsp; The system was working perfectly before SP2 and
 is still working perfectly for all other wireless devices so it isn't a modem/router issue.</p>
<p>I have searched all forums and tried all steps.&nbsp; I have manually entered all of my&nbsp;IP address details in IP4, I have changed registry keys, re-entering IP addresses, default gateways etc in the registry keys, changed from public to private networks etc</p>
<p>I have tried all of the usual netsh solutions,&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig release, renew etc etc.</p>
<p>When manually entering the IP, default gateway and submask addresses I still cannot connect to the internet, even after rebooting etc, and the details revert back to acquiring settings automatically after each reboot.</p>
<p>My system also did not create a restore point so I cannot go back to SP1, so I am now at the stage of having to reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>Any new ideas would be most welcome before I wipe the system clean.</p>
<p>I can provide more specifics when I get back in front of the laptop</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I have MCC digital version that came with console Every time I try to launch the game I get to the main menu screen showing the 4 campaigns, but I cannot get past the screen. &nbsp;Controller(s) both work and while the Options and Career icon is lit up, I cannot
 advance. &nbsp;Controller will turn on, off-allow me to access via my password protect, and can even use other apps on library.</p>

<p>What gives? &nbsp;MCC was the main reason I spent $400 on upgrading to XO after spending several thousand on maxing my X360.</p>
<p>Very frustrated after reading all the posts that say MSFT cant fix. &nbsp;Please advise or I will pursue refund.</p>

            <p>Power down the computer, start it again, just before the system loads the Windows operating system; hit the [F8] Function 8 key on your keyboard which will launch the Advanced Boot Options menu. choose the Last Known Good feature.</p>
<p>Once you have booted into the desktop normally, try the following:</p>
<p>Thats a lot of updates to install. My recommendation would be to install the updates in batches, such 5 at a time, exclude hardware/driver updates. Avoid installing a combination of Microsoft Windows and Office updates at the same time. Also, try installing
 the small updates first. Avoid installing things like .NET Framework and SQL Express Updates.</p>
<p>Restart each time you install the updates (its a chore, but it guarantees a more reliable experience). Try starting out with Microsoft Office Updates for programs such as (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint).</p>
<p>Another thing, try downloading the updates then install them. When prompted to restart, disconnect from the Internet and restart your computer.</p>
<p>Proceed with installing the additional updates.</p>
<p>If the computer continues to become non-responsive, try the following:</p>
<p>ã€€</p>
<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page. But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</u></a></p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</u></a></p>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously. Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers. If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode. Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

<br />Where in Windows 10 are you seeing this error message?
<br />
<br />Have you installed any new hardware or software since this started happening?
<br />
<br />I would try performing a system restore before you started seeing this error to see if it helps.

<h2>            How to get around Microsoft Store&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a brand new Sony laptop and one of the "apps" is Microsoft Store. &nbsp; With no "search option", it's very difficult to locate what your looking for. &nbsp;They don't come in categories like books.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am looking for the Old and New Testament Commentaries by Jon Courson. &nbsp; I have that on my IPAD and it was easy to search for on the apple store because it has different categories. &nbsp;With this Microsoft store I just know where to start. &nbsp;Some may call
 it a Window store but on the apps that came with my laptop it reads Microsoft store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I need help in getting the books I mention above. &nbsp;Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi MelvinPartido Sr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows store is a preinstalled app through which we download apps. The Microsoft Store is a chain of retail stores and an online shopping site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Search</strong> option is not included in Windows store app in Windows 8 operating system. However, you can search for the apps using the Windows Search feature that gets the list of apps. For more information, you may use this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_store/how-do-you-search-in-the-app-store/9e418e0b-bd6f-4a15-80ff-b20ee0721ea2">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Search option is included in Windows 8.1 store app, all you need to do is, just upgrade your Windows 8 operating system to Windows 8.1.</strong></p>

            XVT is an "old" development tool, that does not always <br />
comply with the newest printerdrivers. A suggestion is <br />
therefore to try installing an older - or just different -<br />
driver and try again.<br />

<h2>            windows 10 ruined my life and my tablet</h2>
                    <p>first off i highly do not recommend windows 10. &nbsp;horrible, you cant even turn offf windows update which is why i think it messed up in the first place. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>one day i randomly turned my tablet on, it worked perfectly fine the day before, then it said there was an error or whatnot that stupid blue screeen with a frown face, how immature. &nbsp;so i try and restard and nothing changes, i got into advance recovery option,
 click every single thing nothing hppens. &nbsp;load a previous windows version on a flash drive set the bios correctly and still nothing happens it wont even allow the flash drive to run. &nbsp;i tried restarting the system with &nbsp;clean boot. &nbsp;it manages to work for
 that session only and if i turn the tablet off then on again i get the blue screen error of death forwny face again. &nbsp;it wont let me roll back or run the flash drive from the OS itself either it says it failed. &nbsp;so whatever you idiots did it made my tablet
 a useless paper weight. &nbsp;i dont have the time to spend fiddling around with this thing runnning your little log programs i am in law school and simply dont have the time. &nbsp;i just need one of you "geniuses" to take control of this tablet and fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>error message: Recover your pc needs to be repaird. &nbsp;a required device is not connected or cant be acessed. &nbsp;error code: 0xc0000225 youll need to use recovery tools blah blah blah.</p>

            Hello LESMOORE44,
<br />
<br />To make use of MiraCast, you should not have to download anything. For computers running Windows 8 or higher and that are equipped with a Wi-Fi adapter can make use of MiraCast without charge. The only time you would incur a cost would be to purchase an adapter/dongle to allow your display or a Wi-Fi adapter for your computer to connect wirelessly with MiraCast.
<br />
<br />For more information about MiraCast with Microsoft Windows, please visit: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15053/windows-8-project-wireless-screen-miracast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15053/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps, let us know if you require any further assistance. Thank you.
