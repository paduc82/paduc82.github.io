<h2>            How do I remove all traces of Libraries from Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>I truly loathe Windows 10 libraries. </strong>They're useless for the way I handle my files in projects where audio, video, music and document assets come and go on a per-client basis, and change locations quickly. But Microsoft is convinced it knows
 my needs better than I do. It renames my folders with Library names and wants to move their contents around to please itself. And, it seems most or all questions about removing Library listings have been locked in this forum with unsatisfactory answers or
 are uselessly years old. I've emptied the Library folder in Windows Explorer's navigation bar. Now, here's what I need...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp; How do I remove the empty Libraries folder </strong>from the Navigation pane since I have no libraries....</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. How do I delete the useless Music folder </strong>in my Navigation pane? There's no deleting this either. Even though it points to a folder with a different name, I cannot change it on the Nav pane. I'm stuck with a warning popup saying my music
 is unavailable and might have been deleted. Not helpful. Security info is "unavailable or can't be displayed" How do I rid my PC of this?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. How can I rename the Videos folder or change its icon?</strong> I have more than one folder containing videos. I don't want all my vid files placed in the same folder — whether in sub-folders or not. I want the freedom to choose whether they're
 located on a fast SSD for editing or placed in a storage drive. How can I delete Windows Videos folder in order to create a series of project folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. 3D objects is uninstalled. How can I remove its listing in Navigation?&nbsp;</strong>Don't use it, never will. It's a space-wasting annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, REAL answers will help me undo Windows tyrannical behavior. My only solution seems to be to make Quick Access shortcuts to suit my needs, but cluttering the Nav Pane with useless micromanaged file demands by Windows. This has to stop.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Michael, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />I understand your pain - there are a lot of parts of Windows 10 I wish were more customizable.
<br />
<br />I'll give you some ways to remove the things you've listed:
<br />
<br />To remove 3D Objects from the navigation pane, you'll need to modify the registry. Press Windows Key+R and type...
<br />
<br />regedit
<br />
<br />...then press Enter. Copy and paste the below address into the address bar at the top of Registry Editor:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\NameSpace
<br />
<br />...then locate the below entry:
<br />{0DB7E03F-FC29-4DC6-9020-FF41B59E513A}
<br />
<br />Right-click the entry, and delete it. This will remove the 3D Objects icon from your navigation pane.
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />As for the Libraries icon in the navigation pane, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />- Open File Explorer and click the View tab at the top.
<br />- Click Options in the top-right.
<br />- In the folder options window, click the View tab.
<br />- Scroll down in the list and uncheck Show Libraries.
<br />
<br />Once you've done the above steps, I'll see if I can address your other issues. Let me know how you go!       
        </p>

<p>File Explorer &gt; View ribbon &gt; Panes group &gt; Navigation pane dropdown &gt; remove the checkmark from Show libraries
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Libraries are simply a way of looking at your folders. The actual folders (and the files inside them) are organized exactly the same way whether you choose to look at them as Libraries or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Libraries had a short life. Microsoft quickly dropped the idea in favor of cloud storage. That's why Libraries are not enabled in a clean install of Windows 10.</p>

<p>I'm guessing you have the Navigation Pane view settings to 'Show All Folders', is that correct? Otherwise, removing Libraries from the Navigation Pane is a simple matter of clearing the checkbox for 'Show LIbraries'</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc4b2775-db2f-4bdf-8588-94d66f1d61c5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc4b2775-db2f-4bdf-8588-94d66f1d61c5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If that's the case, you can try removing the 'Libraries' from the Desktop namespace:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\{031E4825-7B94-4dc3-B131-E946B44C8DD5}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Music &amp; 3D Objects aren't normally root-level items in the Navigation Pane, they appear as items under 'This PC'. Is that not your situation? Can you post a screenshot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The This PC system shortcuts to User folders can be renamed, re-iconed, and re-purposed if you like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Redirection to a new target folder can be accomplished via the Location tab in the folder's Properties dialog or by directly editing the values found under:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</strong><br />
</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\CLSID</span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><span>Here is how I changed the name of '3D Objects' to 'Sandbox'</span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Study the other subkeys to see how to assign a custom icon.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Here's a handy reference for the folders inserted under This PC:</p>

            I <em>did </em>a clean install of Windows 10 on November 10 with a fresh license using Windows 1809 with software provided by Microsoft Support. It's now at OS build 17763.167 — I'm assuming updates changes this number. However, Libraries persisted. If
 Microsoft is phasing out libraries, they sure have a stupid way of setting us free from its clutches,&nbsp;

</p><p>Thanks, Keith. I'll give it a shot. Before I start, will these Registry customization entries survive when the next version of Windows is released?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the;y'll survive a major update or not. It's a good idea to export the key you modified so you can restore your customizations if it's reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also hide the folders under <strong>This PC</strong>. Then <strong>This PC</strong> would display only drives &amp; network locations and you could have all customized folder shortcuts in
<strong>Quick Access</strong>.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try these methods and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<div>Known multiplayer issues in Halo: Combat Evolved.</div>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829469</a></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>Create a new user account that has administrative rights. Then, use that user account to download and install the game update separately. To do this, follow these steps:</div>
<div>a.Create a new user account that has administrative rights. </div>
<div>Create a user account.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Create-a-user-account</a></div>
<div>b.Log off from the current user account.<br />
<div>c.Log on to the computer by using the new user account that you created.<br />
d.After you log on to the computer, visit the following Microsoft Web site to download and install the game update:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/downloads.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/downloads.aspx</a></div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> When you install the update, the installation may take more time to process some of the files in the update. This behavior occurs because of the size of the file that is being updated or the amount of data that has to be incorporated
 into the file. If you see the update installation not progressing for some time, wait until the game update installation continues and finishes.<br />
<div>e.Log off from the new user account. <br />
<div>f. Log on to the computer by using your original user account. Then, play the game.
<br />

<h2>            Error message from RunDLL saying the specified module could not be found</h2>
                    <p><span>Well I goofed. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Running Windows 10 on a Dell 23 desktop</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I replaced my HP Envy 120 series printer with the HP Envy 140 series (which I made the default printer)<span>&nbsp;
</span>and gave the 120 to my son. Sometime later I was browsing C drive and noticed in C:\Program Files\HP\ the folders for HP Envy 120 and HP Envy 140. Without thinking I deleted the folder for the HP Envy 120 rather than uninstalling it. As far as I can
 tell there has been no harm done except that when I boot the computer I get an error message from RunDLL saying the specified module could not be found.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I looked in the recycle bin but did not find the folder. (I must have permanently deleted it). I assume I could go on line with HP and download and reinstall the software so I could then uninstall it, but I am not sure that is a wise thing to do.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The DLL error message is mildly annoying and I’d like to get rid of it without having to jump through a lot of hoops. Any thoughts?</span></p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When trying to install Win 10 it just stays on "Progress 0%, if I'm using the downloaded tool of Microsoft's web site. If I try doing the "wuauclt.exe /updatenow" in cmd, it eventually says "Check your PC before you update", And clicking "Check your PC"
 doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The the only error message I seem to get is the Check your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In turn, when I try to reset the PC it goes "Preparing..." And then says "There was a problem resetting your PC" "No changes were made"</p>
<p>There is a button allowing you to check for solutions, but it doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>
Thanke</p>

            <p>I've include information on how to create a Windows 10 USB drive without the use of Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read more about it here. You should be able to use this upgrade to Windows 10 by canceling the previous installation and then running "setup.exe" from the USB drive you create with the proper Windows 10 ISO. Your tablet should treat the USB port
 like a disc drive—and properly upgrade you to Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi ShaneWelsher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this app is a Minecraft modification tool, is that correct? If yes, then I highly suggest that you contact the app developer to get further assistance regarding this issue. I'm sure they can assist you better as they are more knowledgeable with
 their products. Maybe there is a correct setting that you need to apply to your app in order to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.<span><br />

<p>
</p><p>I fell asleep last night while working and woke up at around 4:30. I went over to my PC hoping to get some more work done and noticed it had just completely frozen at, I believe it was around 11:35 PM. There was nothing I could do, so I just held the power
 button down and restarted the computer. Everything works just fine.. except for some reason my wifi wont work anymore. I have a wireless adapter, but my PC wont show any available networks to connect to. I went on device manager and checked the deive status
 of ny Realtek adapter, under which it said everything is working fine. I typed in “netsh wlan show networks” into command prompt and it said “There is no wireless interface on this system.” I also tried updating my adapters drivers and making sure that power
 saving wasnt on and setting the power settings for the adapter to maximum performance, but to no avail. I am stumped and hoping for some help.</p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Continuous growing of System &#38; Reserved space in Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vendutch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continuous growing of System &#38; Reserved space in Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Before asking the question, I will point out the configuration and usage of my computer.</p>
<p>- Use a Pro 3&nbsp; Tablet with i5 and 256GB drive, upgraded to Windows 10 after official release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Used to manage&nbsp;more or less 128GB of drive space with mostly Office 365 applications usage., some music and images.</p>
<p>- SharePoint usage is about 7.5 GB storage with 5000+ files</p>
<p>- And most of my private files are on Onedrive 32GB.&nbsp; </p>
<p>- SharePoint and Onedrive files&nbsp;are used and moved quite often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:&nbsp;the System &amp; reserved space reports 163GB storage and with the rest of the installed applications and files it leaves me with lest then 20GB free, slowing considerably the system when getting lower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the 163GB be lowered to a "reasonable" size or should I change my behavior to avoid growing this space absurdly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Some people have mentioned to recreate SharePoint completely, because every time a repair is executed, it leaves old copies somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community. We understand your concern and we will try our best to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the&nbsp;details that you have provided to help us get a clearer picture of the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that the Storage issue with Surface devices has been an ongoing issue. &nbsp;I would not suggest that you shrink or alter your Storage and Reserved space I any manner.&nbsp;I would recommend that you add an&nbsp;external source of storage, for
 eg, sd card, USB drive etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the section <strong>How can I add more storage space?</strong> in the article
<strong>Surface storage</strong>&nbsp;provided in the link below</p>

            <p>Thank you for your prompt reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is an ongoing issue, when do you expect this to be solved? With Windows 8.1 I was not aware of this being an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have thought to reinstall Windows 10 again but then in a few months I will be coming back to this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me there would be no problem to use an external storage but as this&nbsp;reserved space&nbsp;keeps growing and will eventually eat up all disc space.&nbsp;When reduced to 5% of available space, the system starts to respond very slow and working with it is not acceptable.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start off, I would like to rephrase my statement, the ongoing issue here implies to that fact that the storage space offered by Surface is&nbsp;low and may not be enough for frequent users such as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to address your query I would suggest that you refer to the article <strong>
What to do if Surface is running slower</strong> provided in the link below</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the&nbsp;time and effort that you have invested in to fix the issue and also apologize for the inconvenience&nbsp;faced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;per the information that you have provided, I would suggest that you try to perform the steps mentioned below and check if the system space reduces in size. This will help us narrow down if the cause of the issue are the applications or there is some
 other cause to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. On the search bar, type <strong>Disk Cleanup </strong>and click on it.</p>
<p>2. Then select the drive that is increasing in space and click on <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>3. Reboot&nbsp;and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest that you clear temp files&nbsp;and %temp% files and check. To clear temp files&nbsp;and %temp% files follow the steps below</p>
<p>1. On the search bar type, Run.</p>
<p>2. In the dialog box, type <strong>temp </strong>and <strong>%temp% </strong>respectively.</p>
<p>3. Delete the data present in the folder and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi again, </p>
<p>Followed your instructions but, since my initial email, System and Reserved space grew an other 1GB in storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information my system provides is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Files: 164GB</p>
<p>Virtual Memory: 3.64GB</p>
<p>Hibernation: 3.16</p>
<p>System Restore: 5.27GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 other Surface Pro 3 are being used in the office, one with 40GB and the other with 90GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not run virtual systems, just office365, Onedrive Personal/business&nbsp;and lots of browsing to SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that after upgrading from 8.1 to 10, if I reset the system, 10 will be reinstalled?&nbsp; If you provide me some instructions, I will try to reset my system as every time my system slows down, I have to do maintenance with Disk Cleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I seem to have the exact same problem, except a little worse. My system and reserved files have grown to over 325GB and keep growing. Every few days I have to restore to an earlier point to just get 5 or 10gb of space to be able to run anything at all.</p>
<p>I talked to microsoft help without much luck. The tech people there did not seem to have a clue as to what is going on and everytime it was the same disk clean up etc. with some reboots and no result.</p>
<p>I tried SFC /scannow as suggested by someone on this forum, and everything seems fine.</p>
<p>Also, the file explorer or any of the directory tree programs (like dirtree or top100files etc.) do not show the system files. I used drive clone to backup the drive and it only saw and backed up the 175gb of the 466gb disk, and did not account for the 325gb
 of system files.</p>
<p>Any solution would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>My system storage looks like this:</p>

<p>Thanks. Only a clean windows 10 install seemed to "work"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a clean install, I had to re-install all of my programs which was rather difficult since I did not have a list of programs. Now I am making a list as I install each program so that next time it will be less hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been 15 days since the clean install and the system files still seem to be growing. They started out at 20GB and now are at 38GB. At this rate, in a few months they will reach unmanageable levels like 350GB and I will need to do a clean install of
 windows again. Unless some windows 10 update resolves the issue. Or some Microsoft guy looks at this thread and comes up with a solution.</p>

<p>Hi Panduranga, I did a clean install in 2016 and since then, with all programs reinstalled again, it has not grown over the 150GB. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also can control with Onedrive to have storage space saved using the new features to select to have files local or in the cloud, which gives me flexibility on storage space in use.</p>
<p>But yes, reinstall definitely has helped me out.&nbsp; This is not wat Microsoft suggested to do.</p>

            <p>To be sure everyone is on the same page . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge actually has two different concepts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First is a "Open with:" where you choose what page/pages the browser will open with EACH TIME.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second is the "Home Page" where you select whether the "Home" icon is shown and where you go when the button is visible and clicked or (button visible or not) you press "ALT+HOME" keys. &nbsp;(Note: you can only set the HOME page location when the setting
 for the Home button visibility is ON. &nbsp;You can turn it back off and the keyboard shortcut still works - you just don't actually have the HOME icon.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is accessible directly under settings... &nbsp;"Open with". &nbsp;I could go into more detail - but why when it's been done so well HERE:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5090-microsoft-edge-startup-page-change-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5090-microsoft-edge-startup-page-change-windows-10-a.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is a little deeper in... under settings --&gt; view advanced settings --&gt; show the home button (on to set the home page and turn on the home icon, off to turn off the home icon [but the home page itself will stay set so &nbsp;the hotkey still
 works.])</p>

            <p>Hey Shenan Stanley</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick and detailed answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this one out, without success. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the "Open with" is configured customized&nbsp;by this policy "Configure coroporate Home pages", where I set a value, for example "https://google.com/"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still couldn't find the setting, to define the "Home-Page" on advanced settings.</p>
<p>I guess it has to do with the policy-settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Duc</p>

<h2>            cant text wrap photos in wordpad</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10. I had a long complex document in Word which had many photos text wrapped tightly within it. Now the document seems to sit in Wordpad and I cant seem to find a way of text wrapping the photos. This is a 16,000 word document
 with hundreds of photos that now looks disastrous. Help please.

<p>Probably because you launched Wordpad instead of Word. Press the Windows key then have a look under All Apps / Microsoft Office. If Word is installed then you should find it there.<br />

 This is something I used all the time, so it is putting a big crimp in my workflow.</p>

    <title>Windows stucks after inserting SD Card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kovu007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows stucks after inserting SD Card</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've got a little problem.</p>
<p>I have an Acer Iconia W510 Tablet&nbsp;with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Yesterday a new problem occurred, I've never had before.</p>
<p>I used a MircoSD Card to save all my personal Data on it, because I've no enough space on my tablet.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, after I restarted my Tablet, it was not that stable, than it was before. I logged in, and I had only a black screen and after a few seconds it finally loaded the Windows UI, but everything was not like it supposed to be. I figured out, that my
 microSD card, because it wasn't shown in the windows explorer, that my SD card causes the instability.
</p>
<p>I've tried to restart and insert my SD card again, but Windows will stuck immediately, or the explorer is stuck.</p>
<p>Then I entered the Safe Mode to run a scan through CHKDSK to check my drive.</p>
<p>It always starts in read-only mode and says </p>
<p>"Warning! F not specified"</p>
<p>At the End it tells me that the Volume Bitmap is not how it's supposed to be and that I should run an offline scan and run, because CHKDSK/scan or /spotfix doesn't work.
</p>
<p>So I tried to do the offline Scan and Fix which only happened after I restarted, because it couldn't do it right away because the drive was already in use by something else.</p>
<p>I didn't checked it again, because I ran it before I wrote this Post.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried then to insert my SD Card again, but nothing changed, It still has problems with my SD Card.</p>
<p>Does Anyone know, how to fix it WITHOUT refreshing the System, because then I'll fall down to Windows 8 again, download all the Updates, then Download Windows 8.1 through the MS AppStore and finally install MS Office 2013, that means I would be really busy
 the whole night because of this weird Issue.</p>
<p>And Windows already&nbsp;ran before a couple of Months without problems. I just know, that Acer Update installed an Update with ActiveX Log In something, I don't really know what it was, because I thought it's not that necessary, It it shows me a BIOS Version
 which is lower than the Version I installed, and I'm not going to ruin my BIOS again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue might have caused due to files corruption on the SD card or due to not removing the SD card safely. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try connecting the SD card on a different computer and check if the same issue occurs there as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try reinstalling the Card reader drivers from Device Manager and reinstall it.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Uninstalling the card reader from Device Manager:</b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press/tap <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X </strong>
keys and click/tap on <strong>Device Manager</strong></span></span></span><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In <b>Device Manager</b>, locate the
<strong>Card reader</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click the<strong> card reader</strong>, and then click
<b>Uninstall</b> to remove it. </span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer. </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Download the driver from the Acer website and then install it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.acer.com.au/ac/en/AU/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acer.com.au/ac/en/AU/content/drivers</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Run Microsoft Safety Scanner and check if there are any virus infections found.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font><font><b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b>:
</font></font></font><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</font></span></a></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. During
 this 10 days, it will remove all the virus infected files and folders. I suggest you to create a backup of your data and then Install Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you better.</p>

                    <p>After doing the latest update on Windows 10 &nbsp;that my computer forced me to do I can no longer log into my computer using my Pin I have to log in using my Microsoft Account. &nbsp;When I try to log in using my Pin an Error pops up telling me "This sign in option
 is disabled because of failed sign-in attempts or repeated shutdowns. Use a different sign-in option, or keep your device powered on for at least 2 hours and then try again." I read online and someone said to try to change your Pin in the settings. I tired
 that and another Error message popped up saying " The dictionary attack mitigation is triggered and the provided authorization was ignored by the provider." &nbsp;Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Lolita,<br />

<h2>            Computer rebooting itself and not shutting back down.</h2>
                    As the questions says, my computer is rebooting itself.&nbsp; I've tried to go into Task Scheduler and Reboot properties, but when I try to uncheck "Wake the computer to run this task" it won't let me save my choice.&nbsp; If I tried to sign in under my windows
 login it tells me that "An error has occurred for task reboot. Error message: the following error was reported: The supplied variant structure contains invalid data."&nbsp; I also provides two user name options I'm not familiar with and don't know the passwords
 for.&nbsp; Please help, this is getting really obnoxious and worrisome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might not have or lost administrative privileges resulting to unable to configure Task Scheduler. For us to isolate the issue, we would like to ask these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Is your computer connected to a domain or being managed by a Windows Server?</li><li>What is the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/13443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">build number and version of your Windows</a></strong>?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run a antivirus scan using Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>

<h2>            For a new user account, there&#39;s no start menu and no action center</h2>

<li>Nothing happens when I left-click or right-click the Start button--no menu at all.</li><li>When I try to open the Action Center, nothing happens; it won't open.</li></ul>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This happens when logging in to any new user account I create, <em>not </em>just a particular one.</p>

<h2>            WD external drive is not detected by Windows Backup program</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>Backup program with WD external drive</span></p>
<p>I have a WD My Book Essential 320 GB external drive. The Windows Backup program does not recognize the drive.. The drive IS recognized&nbsp; on My Computer and I can access it and transfer and copy and paste to it with no problem. It is just the Backup program
 that does not recognize it. No error messages or anything. It just doesn't recognize the drive when I get to the destination box.I've tried updating the drivers. The WD support site has Backup downloads for OTHER external drives but not this one. Their site
 says to contact Microsoft support. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>You cannot transfer on oem version, it lives and dies on the first PC it was installed on</p>
<p>The other two can be installed on a new PC provided you have the keys for each cd</p>
<p>And if you have new PC's you would need to check first whether winxp drivers are available from the individual hardware makers, or system makers in the case of large oem, eg Dell / HP or Laptop</p>

            The desktop would need to also have a wireless connection and you need to setup a peer to peer network between the two.

            HI Eduardo.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Another idea is to drag or copy your files into OneDrive, once they upload they will be in the OneDrive folder on the other PC to be copied out or left there to remain in sync between PC's.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external drive or flash stick.  The best way is to sort them first into their User Folders, then copy the User folders from your User profile to the backup drive, move it to the other PC and copy them into their folders there. 
<br />
<br />You can also create a Homegroup between PC's to transfer or access files from or on the other PC.  See here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-setup-and-manage-windows-10-homegroup-local-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-setup-and-ma...</a>
<br />
<br />So there are some of the many options to back up and transfer files.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
