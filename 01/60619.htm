    <title>Error - Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> navjotchhina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error - Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close in Internet Explorer &#38; pop-ups in Windows Explorer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows/Internet Explorer/Data Execution Prevention.</p>
<p>I am consistently getting pop-ups of Windows and/or Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close. Windows Explorer especially will sometimes do this every few seconds. &nbsp;I also occasionally get a Dr. Watson debugger pop-up that locks everything
 up on my computer.<br />
<br />
I also get Data Execution Prevention pop-ups indicating that Windows has closed this program to help protect my computer.<br />
<br />
My desktop icons during this process will sometimes disappear. &nbsp;I'm able to reestablish them by going into Task Manager and clicking on the following:
<br />
<br />
"C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\Windows Explorer.lnk"<br />
<br />
I'm unable to go on-line most of the time. &nbsp;Sometimes I'm able to sneak in a "back door" by clicking on a link within an e-mail, but time is limited (anywhere from five minutes to five hours) before I get booted off.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />

            What root killer did Webroot suggest?<br />
<br />
Are you going to provide the other requested information (requested earlier) about your system and if not, why not?<br />
<br />
Did you run the scans indicated in my previous post and if not, why not?&nbsp; I am reluctant to work on weird XP problems if MBAM and SAS have not been run.<br />
<br />
To date, I have never seen a Microsoft Support Engineer in these forums successfully resolve a DEP error the "right" way.&nbsp; Sometimes they have things to try (how's that working out for you?), but you don't need Methods to<span style="font-style: italic"> try</span>,
 you need to <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> things that fix your problem.<br />
<br />
I doubt you have a memory problem or a disk problem - that is not what causes DEP errors.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have made any DEP exceptions in XP to try to get your stuff working, you need to undo any DEP exceptions to proceed.<br />
<br />
If I ever see Windows Explorer crashing and giving DEP errors, here is what I do to figure out what is going on:<br />
<br />
When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you<br />
install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.&nbsp; If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and
 then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView, under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move the Microsoft column closer
 to the top so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header for "Microsoft" to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column) so all the non Microsoft extensions (all the "Nos") are at the top and easy to see.<br />
<br />
The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; XP explorer crashing&nbsp; (you have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on).<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your failure condition.&nbsp; If
 Explorer starts to behave, you will know that some extension in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.<br />
<br />
If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again.&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave.&nbsp; When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can
 enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the error and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list.<br />
<br />
<br />
If Internet Explorer is complaining, launch Internet Explorer with no Add-ons and see if you still have the problem.<br />
<br />
If Internet Explorer then runs okay with no add-ons, you can figure out which add-on is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Windows has a built in option to run Internet Explorer with no Add-ons (imagine that).<br />
<br />
To launch Internet Explorer with no Add-ons, click Start, Programs, System Tools and choose:<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)<br />
<br />
If you can't find that, click Start, Run and in the box enter (or copy/past the following line):<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"&nbsp; -extoff<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch IE with no Add-ons.<br />
<br />
IE will launch with a message reminding you it is running with no add-ons and ask you to click the Home button (do it) and then you can visit some web pages where you might think you would get a DEP error.&nbsp; The pages may look different, but you want to see
 if you still get the DEP error message or not.&nbsp; Then you can enable the Add-ons one at a time until you find the one that is causing problems.<br />

    <title>In Windows 10 , how do you pin &#47; add Internet Explorer 11 to the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankbartling  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Windows 10 , how do you pin &#47; add Internet Explorer 11 to the task bar</h2>
                    <p>I wish to get the icon for Internet Explorer 11 pinned to the task bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The IE 11 Tools section has "Add site to Apps" and "Go to pinned sites" but nothing about how to pin/add IE 11 to the task bar.</p>
<p>So I am asking: How do you pin/add Internet Explorer 11 to the task bar?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SOLUTIONS</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I just stumbled upon "<span>Make Internet Explorer your default browser", <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/make-ie-default-browser#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/make-ie-default-browser#ie=ie-11</a> .</span></p>
<p><span>Look for the section: </span>How do I pin Internet&nbsp;Explorer to my taskbar in the desktop?</p>
<p>I could not get it to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you will have better luck.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, try my solution below.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Below is a multi-step solution that I devised prior to finding the solution listed above.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Edge.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Bing to do a search.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any word for a search argument will work just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used " Cow ".</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to More Action and use the option: Open with Internet Explorer. &nbsp; Doing so will display the Bing output in IE 11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the Menu Bar and make any needed changes. &nbsp; Change the URL to your home page and refresh to display your home page
 web site. &nbsp; Make sure everything is displayed that you wish to display. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>4. &nbsp; Using IE 11 Tools, use Add Site to Apps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; Then click on the window pane in the bottom, left side of the screen and look for the icon in the &nbsp; &nbsp; Recently Added section, the IE app should be listed there.&nbsp; If not, check the All apps section because the entry may have been put there.&nbsp; &nbsp; The home
 page name will be the title of the IE 11 session and the icon associated to the home page site will be the icon in the task bar.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Right click on the Icon and select: Pin to task bar.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Enjoy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the problem with the above instructions is that the icon pinned to the task bar will be the icon of the&nbsp; home page. &nbsp; If you like that then you can stop here. &nbsp; If you dislike the icon then do the following.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Just use the icon a few times resulting in Internet Explorer being added to your&nbsp; Most Used list.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click on the Windows icon in the lower left part of the screen and checked the Most Used list located along the left edge of the screen.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If Internet Explorer is in the Most Used list then right click on the IE 11 icon and&nbsp; click on Pin to Taskbar.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Now click on the IE 11 icon on the Taskbar to start IE 11.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Enjoy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Side comment:&nbsp; If you use Norton Security from Symantec, the add-ons&nbsp; Norton Tool Bar and Norton Identity Protection will be enabled but not displayed on the tool bar. &nbsp; This is&nbsp; a little confusing because their presence is displayed in other browsers.&nbsp;

<h2>            Microsof Edge and Windows 10</h2>
                    After 2 years of smooth operation of Windows10 on new laptop, I am suddenly now unable to access the Internet. When I click on Internet icon, Microsoft edge starts up briefly then throws me out after 30 seconds or so with out letting me access any websites.
 I've tried the "scan now" procedure and have reset all internet options, but it still doesn't work. Help please!

    <title>Entering activation key after 30 days&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonoc5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entering activation key after 30 days&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a copy of windows 7 home premium a few months ago to use with my&nbsp;programming&nbsp;course. Due to my poor eyesight i was unable to read the activation code when asked to do so during&nbsp;installation&nbsp;and just&nbsp;continued&nbsp;on. Everything worked fine without
 a key until a few days ago where the internet stopped working. I'm told it's because i didn't enter the key but when i look for somewhere to enter it i can't find anything. Is this because i've waited too long? is my key useless now?
<div>I'm using an iMac in bootcamp if that makes a difference. Thanks in advance.</div>

<p>any current software or drivers. &nbsp;Right now I am stuck just replaying them on my recorder and deleting files before I need the next weeks class.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think I am stuck having to purchase a new voice recorder but I would appreciate any and all input.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t pin Microsoft Office icons to taskbar on Windows 10</h2>
                    I just bought a new computer and after using it for a few weeks, several icons from Microsoft Office disappeared from the taskbar, including Excel, Word and Outlook. There is an invisible box in the taskbar where these these icons would go and if you put
 the cursor over it the word, "excel" etc. will appear. I cannot pin them from the programs because it assumes they are already pinned and the only option is "unpin from taskbar." How do you get them to appear on the taskbar?

</p><p>Nope still does not work. I don't think you are understanding my issue - i know how to make a call, my issue is on a conference call i need to make a selection with the dial pad to choose an option. There used to be an icon to bring up the dial pad but i
 cannot see it anymore. If i use the person+ icon all i get is this which is not to she as touch tone selection on an active call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No-one seems to understand this problem or be able to answer it. Please can you escalate higher. If the next reply does not work I'm going to seek a refund on my subscription because the app is no longer working for me and providing the service im trying
 to use it for. Furthermore it's fine on my iPad but for a reason keeps crashing/has become super slow even though everything is up to date and has space (version 6.35.0.54)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either that or please advise how i can downgrade my app version on android/resolve iPad problem. I would follow Google search instructions except i don't want to take risk of downloading app from a potentially unsecure site</p>

            Hi Wardeh... This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<div>Hi there,</div>
<div><br />
Refreshing your pc will not affect any of your files. But it will remove all of the applications and programs you installed. You will also need to update the Windows 8 core applications and the system itself.
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

    <title>How to change keyboard layout for windows 8 &#40;UK version&#41; to US - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwal_dr_on  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change keyboard layout for windows 8 &#40;UK version&#41; to US version</h2>
                    <p>Hello I am sorry to say I downloaded the wrong version of Windows 8, which was the UK version. I noticed no differences on my UK version from the original US version except when I use the keyboard. Many common symbols are switched, which is painfully annoying
 as a programmer. Instead of reinstalling and backing up my files, is there a way to just manually change the build of my keyboard to have the same layout of the US version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First attempt:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel&gt; Hardware and Devices&gt; USB keyboard</p>
<p>-Once in the properties of the kerboard, I can't find a way to change the layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second attempt:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager&gt;kerboard</p>
<p>-That bring me to the same window which is dependent on the driver of the installed keyboard</p>

    <title>Skype for Business Call Forwarding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reecemoyes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business Call Forwarding</h2>
                    <p>I have a UK number assigned to auto attendant that is forwarded to a specific persons Skype in the organisation. I want this call to be further forwarded to that persons external mobile number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Said person has a Phone System licence and a Calling Plan (both enabled via the Skype for Business Admin Portal). I have turned on call forwarding to +44xxxxxxxxx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the end goal is for a customer to phone the company number, that call is then forwarded to persons Skype which is then forwarded to that persons mobile number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, the call makes it as far as Skype, but it fails to dial the mobile number. Instead the operator says "John Smith is not available".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to how to solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Drop-down Menu Malfunction in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzanne m.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drop-down Menu Malfunction in Windows 7</h2>
                    I purchased a new PC with Windows 7, I've loaded Microsoft Office with Access, and Quicken 2008.&nbsp; For the past several weeks&nbsp;the drop-down menus in Windows and Quicken&nbsp;no longer work, the Start Menu no longer functions correctly either.<br />
If I click on "Start", then "All Programs", then choose something that is not in the originally seen window, the list scrolls back to the top and the item that is 3 places higher than the one I selected on the list opens.<br />
In Windows, in "Turn Windows Features On or Off", the same type of thing happens; if I try to scroll down the list to choose something that is not visible in the original window, it just puts me back up at the top and I can't select anything.<br />
In Quicken, I open a window to perform a task, the entire window waivers and blinks, I click on a drop down menu,&nbsp; and no matter what I select from the drop-down menu, it goes back to the first option in the list.

            I recently upgraded from a Surface 1 to a Surface 3. &nbsp;My original Type keyboard works perfectly with the Surface 3 although the physical dimensions don't match so not really suitable as a cover. &nbsp;I think you can connect and use any Type keyboard with the
 Surface 3 as the connections have been kept the same.

<p>Hi Bruno,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When the Automatic repair fails, we can suggest using the command prompt from Windows 10 Boot Options menu to run bootrec commands to fix the files the Auto Repair couldn't. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the windows Recovery Option, choose <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>
Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Enter the following commands in the Command Prompt:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd</li><li>bootrec.exe /fixmbr</li><li>bootrec.exe /fixboot</li></ul>
<p>Once the repair is done, restart your PC and check if the issue is resolved. Let us know the outcome, so we could provide further assistance as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>
<p>
