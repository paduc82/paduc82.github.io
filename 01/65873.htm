            <p><span>Hello George,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue can be caused due to incorrect keyboard language settings. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method&nbsp;1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your default keyboard layout or input method is the one that’s automatically used with the language you see Windows in (for example, the QWERTY keyboard for American English). If you want to keep your Windows language the same but use a different keyboard
 automatically, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Open Control Panel by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
<strong>Search</strong> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
<strong>Search</strong>), entering <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the search box, and then tapping or clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Enter <strong>Add a language</strong> in the search box, and then tap or click
<strong>Add a language</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Tap or click <strong>Advanced settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Under <strong>Override for default input method</strong>, choose the keyboard layout or input method you'd like to be your new default, and then tap or click
<strong>Save</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information, please refer to the below link:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/add-language-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change your language or keyboard</a></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then try method 2. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to these steps to <strong>delete English (United States) </strong>
Windows display language.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key and X </strong>key together.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b.&nbsp;Select <strong>Control Panel</strong> and then click on<strong> Language</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c.&nbsp;Go to <strong>Change your language preference</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. Move the English (UK) keyboard up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e.&nbsp;You will be able delete the <strong>English</strong> (United States) Windows display language.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>f. Now reboot the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you</span></p>

<p>Greeting everybody.</p>
<p>My Lifecam VX-6000 stopped working a few months ago. When plugged in, it is detected as "USB20 camera" and whether I install the drivers and software from the CD first, or look for a specific location with the drivers, Windows will say it can't find proper
 the drivers for the webcam.</p>
<p>I tried a fresh Windows XP install with no success.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>What happened when you tried the steps?</p>
<p>Were there any error messages you can post in this thread?</p>
<p>What have you tried already?</p>
<p>What is the PC brand and model?</p>
<p>If it failed on a fresh install of XP, the device may have failed.</p>
<p>You can try it on another computer to see if it works.</p>

<h2>            Problem with navigation files &#40;kml, gpx&#41; to load from within programs such as Google Earth.</h2>
                    <p>Pretty much exhausted Google Earth forum help.&nbsp; For some reason I can not open a kml, kmz, gpx file in GE.&nbsp; Soon as I hit&lt; File&gt;&lt;Open&gt; get a freeze up.&nbsp; A directory&nbsp;option&nbsp;should appear so that I should be&nbsp; able to select a file.&nbsp; GE runs okay as long as
 I don't try to open or save.&nbsp; Another navigation program is Garmin Basecamp.&nbsp; If I try to do a file import, it too also freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other windows programs such as adobe acrobat finding unable to load file into also, as I just checked.&nbsp; So might be a freeze problem in all platformed programs that open from within and are supposed to offer a file directory.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the instance of using Google Earth, I have it set up to open both kml and gpx file by double clicking the file in the explorer directory.&nbsp; The Google Earth program then does load.&nbsp; It loads the kml as a track on the satellite map but the gpx opens the
 program without being able to load open the gpx to a visible track.&nbsp; Program runs okay until I try to load from within or try to save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted all other navigation programs.&nbsp; Did a ms link to help uninstall all remnants of removed programs.&nbsp; Did a reinstall of Google Earth and done reboot.</p>

            <p><strong>Nothing worked.&nbsp; Google and other programs will not open file directories within programs.&nbsp; Otherwise they run fine.&nbsp; I think I realize now it is not just google earth.&nbsp; In addition to the Navigation programs like Google Earth, GarminBaseCamp and
 MapSource which have no problem to open and run, Adobe Acrobat also not loading files from within.&nbsp; It is only when I try to bring in a file, &nbsp;ex.&lt;File&gt;&lt;Open or Import&gt; that the programs freeze.&nbsp; This&nbsp;just happened when I opened Adobe Acrobat also when&nbsp; I
 tried to bring in a file, the program was running fine but froze up without going to a directory popup to choose my file.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Rant:</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if it might have something to do with OneDrive.&nbsp; I absolutely hated this program.&nbsp; Somehow I thought it was syncing only&nbsp;one directory to my computer.&nbsp; It synced(which I didn't understand to begin with) &nbsp;all kinds of files where they
 somehow loaded into one drive along with being on my computer.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;realized all my pics, music, navigation were sent to something I never intended (even though purchase came with&nbsp;15 gig free use space)to use. &nbsp;I was concerned when I read something about
 MS reducing the space allotted to One Drive and worked with a MS technician who worked on my computer remotely online.&nbsp; He individually put red dot x's on many of my files.&nbsp; It looked like **** when he got done and he finally just got tired I think and didn't
 finish.&nbsp; He said I didn't have anything to worry about since in my situation&nbsp;I had bought my HP computer new&nbsp;with a special package through Best Buy and the reduction in OneDrive space didn't apply.&nbsp; Needless to say I lost hundred of files because it was reduced
 to 10GB and because most of my files were still synced and also deleted from my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like a further deletion is planned to 5 gb, though I think now I'm turned off from sync after the damage has been.&nbsp; Sorry for my vent but I spent many hours
 trying to get back&nbsp;lost files from an old computer that didn't work.&nbsp; I absolutely hated OneDrive I never realized I was pathed into my File Explorer on the computer.&nbsp; I thought it was separated.&nbsp; Something I never-ever want to use is share on the cloud.&nbsp;
 Would maybe use to store some backup files only.&nbsp; Guess I was stupid for not understanding ramifications of being synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Back to my current problem.&nbsp; I can open and run programs of Google Earth, BaseCamp, MapSource, and Adobe Acrobat.&nbsp; I just cannot begin process of loading files into these programs without freezeup.&nbsp; I am at a loss why this is?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done these following procedures as suggested by Google Earth Support:</p>
<p>
</p><div>Google Earth normally works fine in Windows 10. &nbsp;There is something wrong though if you can't use File or Tools. &nbsp;One possibility is those are grayed out when you have a Tour running. &nbsp;The Tour control is at the bottom left of the window and can get covered
 up by the Tour Guide bar.</div>
<div>Some things to keep in mind. &nbsp;You can have the standard version of Google Earth and Google Earth Pro on the same computer. &nbsp;You can only use one at a time and they both use the same My Places file. &nbsp;The last one installed becomes the default for opening
 .kml or .gpx files. &nbsp;These are settings in the Windows registry. &nbsp;Doing things like "<span style="color: rgba(119, 119, 119, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(119, 119, 119, 1)">I disabled the GE&nbsp;exe. file in Basic GE directory"
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">are extremely likely to confuse Windows.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You should uninstall both versions of GE and, importantly, Topofusion. &nbsp;Then run&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.</span></a>&nbsp;for
 all three programs.&nbsp; That should straighten out the registry. &nbsp;Then install Google Earth Pro only. &nbsp;Go to Control Panel&gt;Default Programs&gt;Associate a file type or protocol with a program and make sure .kml, .kmz and .gpx files are associated with Google Earth.
 &nbsp;That should fix it.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>and later: &nbsp;I can't find any old posts with a problem similar to yours. &nbsp;If I had to guess, I'd say there was some kind of Windows permission problem but I can't recommend how to fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Wanted to make clear in feedback through GoogleEarth that &lt;Tools&gt; not working was other option to open a navigation (kml,gpx) file.&nbsp; Going &lt;Tools&gt;&lt;GPS&gt; is also supposed to bring up directory but instead causes a freeze in program.&nbsp; They are saying
 as I believe it is a Windows 10 problem.&nbsp; The red x'circles are no longer in my directory as they were when the technician took control of my computer and unsynced files.&nbsp; I never understood why Windows 10 put some of my navigation files in this directory

            <p>I looked at different problem posts and don't see anything like mine.&nbsp; I did a<strong> SFC -scan
</strong>and everything checked out for no corrupt files. Rebooted afterwards and still have same problems.&nbsp; I am still confused about my directory associations with OneDrive and what the MS online person did exactly to my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the little red dot
 X's for a long time on my files but they are now gone.&nbsp; Don't understand if that all happened in an update.&nbsp; It is still peculiar to me about OneDrive and how it shows in my explorer structure path.&nbsp;

    <title>the ordinal 342 could not be located - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nubnub90  say:</h3>
<h2>            the ordinal 342 could not be located</h2>
                    <p>So let me start with explaining the problem by using a scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open "Word 2016" trough the search bar then it opens without giving me an error, however when I try to open an existing file that I saved on my pc then it shows me the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2db7c5d-58df-4a5a-a03e-64a74d86ee83" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2db7c5d-58df-4a5a-a03e-64a74d86ee83" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(translation: Can not find the ordinal 342 in DLL files )</p>
<p>The program still opens and functions, but I'm worried to why this is happening.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried: sfc /scannow in the cmd, but that didn't change anything. It said that everything was fine.</p>
<p>I tried running malwarebytes and Avast in normal (windows) boot mode and safe (windows) mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also&nbsp;tried: sfc /scannow in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I tried locating the file it is trying to reach:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01df1d9e-1692-47ac-a1c4-4e216e09484e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01df1d9e-1692-47ac-a1c4-4e216e09484e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the file does exist. Because this is in the System32 directory I didn't want to do anything with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. This problem isn't just for "Word 2016", but for many others as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/ suggestions would be helpful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>(some information I found)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error: At least one file was not a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows module</strong>. This means a DLL is probably corrupt. To pinpoint the module having the problem, look through the list of DLLs before the error appeared and find the one with the [&nbsp;! ].
 Here is an example of my xinput dll which is corrupt:&nbsp;<code>[&nbsp;! ] c:\windows\system32\XINPUT1_3.DLL</code></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Source :&nbsp;https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Solving_Runtime_Error_Codes_with_Dependency_Walker</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for me to download that specific dll file and just replace the current one?&nbsp;</p>
<p>(if so: any idea where I can find a legit dll file?)</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can do that but I thought you just wanted to know whether the module that you knew you had contained the entry point that you were getting a report about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, instead of asking DependencyWalker to open that .docx using whatever file type associations exist, I would use it to open your word 2016 (e.g. as an .exe) and then give that problem file to it as a command line parameter.&nbsp; You can do all that using&nbsp;
 DW's&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/help/html/application_profiling.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
profiler&nbsp; command (F7)</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW where did you get your install?&nbsp; I was expecting you to go to the <a href="http://dependencywalker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
official site</a>.&nbsp; I have no idea what all that other site might have included in its install.</p>

<h2>            Changing print size, icon size, without any input from me</h2>
                    I had a normal looking screen, with medium icons and readable print.&nbsp; I wet to a website for awhile, when I returned to my homepage, everything on my screen was miniature.&nbsp; I could barely even see them!<br />
I have my default settings to medium (12 pt), Courier New, font.&nbsp; So, there should be no reason for this.&nbsp; I have absolutely no clue how/why this happens.&nbsp; Clicking on the size icon on the toolbar does nothing.&nbsp; But, I just tried that &amp; this is large.&nbsp; What
 I get is tiny print that I cannot read.&nbsp; How can I make the print kind &amp; size standard for me?

            Hello sanskeen,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
If the system restore does not work, you might try the following.<br />
<br />
You also might try holding down the Ctrl key and use the scroll button on your mouse. It will adjust the size of the entire screen from extremely small to very large. Once you release the scroll button, it will stay that size until you adjust it. Changing the
 size of the Font will not make any difference.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade error IRQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Each time shortly after the progress bar appears I get an error that states&nbsp;IRQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. My PC is a custom build</p>
<p>Mainboard Model<span> </span>P55A-UD3</p>
<p>Manufacturer &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gigabyte Technology Co. Ltd.</p>
<p>Processor<span> </span>Intel Core i7 860</p>
<p>Video Card &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ATI Radeon HD 5770</p>
<p>I have the full CPU-Z report if required. It doesn't create any dump files during the install so I ran driver verifier and was able to recreate the "crash" and I do have dump files from then available as well. I tried to read the dump file but that is where
 my skills end. I have successfully upgrade Windows 10 on 2 other laptop in the house and this is the last PC required. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Let me know how I can get the files here to be reviewed or anything else you may need</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As I understand you are unable to upgrade to Windows 10 and receive an error
</span></span><span><span>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL error in Windows 7 is displayed as a dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Just like other Blue Screen of Death errors, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
 errors arise from corrupt software installations, corrupt system files, incompatible or inappropriate device drivers and faulty hardware devices.<br />
To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;What is the complete blue screen error message that you are getting on your screen?<br />
2.&nbsp;Did you make any recent software or hardware changes to the computer?<br />
3.&nbsp;Are you able to boot to the desktop?&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. please confirm, if you are upgrading from windows update or windows 10 ISO</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are able to boot the computer, then I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>In first place I would suggest you to
</span><span>disconnect all external devices connected to computer except keyboard and mouse and then try to upgrade to windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue still persist, Perform Hardware Cleanboot</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hardware cleanboot:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here’s the procedure to perform Hardware clean boot:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press <strong>Windows + R</strong> and type
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></span></li><li>
<span>In the device manager Expand display adapter and right click on the display adapter and try to disable and try to boot to the desktop.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span>Devices that can be disabled for doing
 a Hardware clean boot are: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display Adapters.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound, video and game controllers.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Network Adapters.<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USB Devices and controller (Please don’t disable this if you are using USB keyboard or Mouse or Wireless Keyboard or mouse).<br />
e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVD/CD-ROM drives.<br />
f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modems<br />
g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ports</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue did’nt get resolve try method2,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Disable Anti-virus software if any installed.
</span></span></strong><strong><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong></span></span></strong><span><span>Antivirus
 software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

            <p>Here are my answers to your questions</p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;What is the complete blue screen error message that you are getting on your screen?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A - I am not getting a BSOD during normal operation of Windows 7. That is the error that comes up on the "Oops we ran into a problem" screen when running the Windows 10 upgrade. Outside of that everything works just
 fine<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;Did you make any recent software or hardware changes to the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A - No, there have been no new installs but as I said regular use is fine<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;Are you able to boot to the desktop?&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A - Yes, it always reverts bask to Windows 7 Successfully after a failed attempt</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>4. please confirm, if you are upgrading from windows update or windows 10 ISO</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A. I have tried upgrading from the updates and I created a USB boot image and both give me the same results</span></span></p>
<p>I have done a clean boot by running MSConfig and removing all start up items and removed all services, except for Microsoft services. That resulted in the same error. I have not tried disabling the hardware devices in your list yet. I will be trying
 that after I post this and will update on the status. For Method 2 I had completely uninstalled my antivirus software on my clean boot attempt with the same results</p>

            I have tried installing to a new partition by booting up from the USB image and still get the same error. Yes I used Acronis to split the C drive so I could do a clean install from boot. There seems to be something conflicting with the hardware but I have
 no idea how to identify what

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App Doesn&#39;t Allow Image In Signatures Anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I recently had to reset my Mail app on my Lenovo Thinkpad. I just purchased and set up my Mail App with an image for the signature less than 6 months ago. However, once I reset - I no longer am able to edit my Signature other than adding unformatted
 text. Can anyone please assist me in fixing this? Thanks. Attached a picture for the screen I see below.</p>

            Hi Anil.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The WIndows 10 Mail app is free, not purchased, and has never offered any other than a text signature.  Are you sure you were previously using the built-in Windows 10 Mail app?
<br />
<br />See this tutorial which has remained the same for years:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/change-the-windows-10-mail-app-default-signature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/change-the-win...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>Hi Greg, thanks for the quick reply. That's the surprising part, I am absolutely sure I was utilizing the built-in Windows 10 Mail app. I am so confused how I was able to set up a Signature before.

                    I wanna burn/add files to a DVD which has files already on it. The DVD is write-protected, so Windows won't let me burn files on it. I don't wanna lose the files on the disc, but I want to add new files. Does anyone know how to burn files skipping the
 write-protection, or to remove it temporarily, or something, without clearing the disc, on Windows 10? Probably I can't, but I wanted to ask here anyways :c

            Hi Stick909101_YT,
<br />
<br />If the DVD is a DVD-r or DVD+R, then you cannot add files to it . . .
<br />
<br />If the DVD is a DVD-RW or DVD+RW, then you can as follows:
<br />
<br />Copy the files from the DVD onto your hard drive
<br />Right click the disk in Windows file Explorer and choose Erase
<br />Copy the files back onto the Disk in File Explorer and add the new files
<br />Burn the Disk

    <title>Removing Optional Features - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rifdhan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing Optional Features</h2>
                    
<p>I'm currently trying to remove any non-essential features from my Windows Vista installation (Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features &gt; Turn Windows Fetaures on or off). However, I don't know what some features do and if they are safe to remove.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if someone can tell me what each of the following tools do,&nbsp;if they are safe to remove/uninstall, and what doing so will do to my system (I'm only interested in the items listed here,&nbsp;I require the other features):</p>
<p>- Internet Information Services (IIS)</p>
<p>- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0</p>
<p>- Remote Differential Compression</p>
<p>- SNMP Features</p>
<p>- Telnet Client &amp; Server</p>
<p>- TFTP Client</p>
<p>- Windows DFS Replication Service</p>
<p>- Windows Process Activation Service</p>
<p>- Windows Web Services API</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any information,</p>

<p>Thank you for your helpful response. I have been in touch with Konig. They have a new version that is OK for Windows 10 but they do not have a reseller in Israel and they are most unhelpful in refusing to supply me directly even though it is a replacement
 for my present version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another make that you can recommend?</p>

    <title>Vista Scanning software for external flatbed scanner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mmattern  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista Scanning software for external flatbed scanner</h2>
                    How can I remove scan profiles from the vista scanner interface?<br />
When using a scanner how can I change the default scan profile without having to create a new profile? Once I create a new scan profile, How do I delete it?<br />
<br />
e.g. When I use a scanner&nbsp; interface on my HP computer,&nbsp; under&nbsp; PROFILE I can change the scan profiles and save them for later reuse. But there seems to be no way of&nbsp;&nbsp; DELETING a profile once is created. And no way to change the DEFAULT profile unless you create
 a new profile and save it.&nbsp; So I cannot&nbsp; change the default profile from one group of settings to another without creating a&nbsp; NEW scan profile and&nbsp; saving it as the default.&nbsp; which means if you want to switch the default profile you end up with a long list
 of scan profiles you can not purge or delete from the interface window.<br />

            Hello MMattern,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I will need just a little more information in other to better assist you.&nbsp; What model of scanner and the software you are using.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
There are a few ways to get the functions and features back that you want.&nbsp; The easiest would be to uninstall the device and then reinstall.&nbsp; I've included&nbsp;the steps to remove then add them back below.<br />
<br />
<p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click Start/Orb and&nbsp;select&nbsp;Device Manager to open it.‌&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type
 the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>In Device Manager, locate the device you want to remove, and then double-click the device name.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Driver</span> tab, and then click&nbsp;uninstall<span>&nbsp;</span>and disconnect the device from computer and restart.<br />
<br />
Now when you reconnect the device after the restart it should reinstall the default driver settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.</p>
</li></ol>

    <title>External Hard Drive Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walterrowlands  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Hard Drive Issues</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to use an external hard drive (the brand is KESU if that's important.) First, I tried to set it as my download location, which only resulted in an error message. I then tried to delete some of the files on it, but nothing happened. I unplugged
 it, and upon plugging it back in, it was listed as Local Disk as opposed to KESU. I then tried to open it, resulting in an error message: "This request could not be performed as the result of an I/O device error." I tried some fixes I found online, to no avail.
 What should I do?</p>

            It's USB 3.0. It is formatted in NTFS. My data is already on the drive, but it's an interesting situation. My computer stopped working, so I had it fixed, which of course entailed a factory reset. Before this, the drive worked fine on the computer in question.
 Now it says it is data from another PC although it's from my own. It doesn't work in any of the USB ports. I haven't tried letting it "settle" yet. In disk manager, it says it's been formatted in RAW, but the original format was NTFS.

<p>
</p><p>If you rebuilt the computer, its Security IDs and such changed - so you need to take ownership change permissions of all the files on that drive.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are receiving error while trying to sync HTC Desire 816 to WMP12 and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this the first time you are trying to sync your phone to WMP12?</li><li>If yes, do you remember making any specific change in WMP12 settings or phone or in computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>This could be due incorrect sync settings in both WMP12 and phone&nbsp;or corruption in WMP12. Let's try the following methods and check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the Windows media Player troubleshooters and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Press

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Now type
<strong>Troubleshooter</strong> in the <strong>search</strong> option.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>In the search option in the new window, type Media Player and click on Windows Media Player Settings Troubleshooter and follow the prompts.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span></span></span></span>Clear the Windows Media Player database cache files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
b. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R</strong>, type <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c. Select the <strong>Media Player folder</strong>, and then
<strong>Delete</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>d. Restart Windows Media Player.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 3: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Clear the Windows Media Player database and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
b. Press <strong>Windows</strong> Key + <strong>R</strong>, type </span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
c. Select <strong>all the files in the folder</strong>, and then click <strong>Delete</strong></span> on the File menu.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></span></strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em>You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.</em><br />
<br />
</span></span></span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 4: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How can I prevent duplicate or invalid entries from being added to my library when I play music files?</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<span><br />
</span></span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When you move digital media files on your computer, the file name and file path information remain unchanged in your library. Then when you select a file to play from its new location, a new entry is created
 in your library if the option to automatically add it to your library when it is played is selected. As a result of this, your library may quickly contain a large number of duplicate or invalid entries.<br />
<br />
To prevent music files from being added automatically to your library<br />
<br />
a. In Windows Media Player, on the<span><strong>Tools</strong> menu, click<strong> Options.</strong></span></span></span><br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. On the <span><strong>Player</strong> tab, clear the
<strong>Add music files to library</strong></span> when played check box.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this information is helpful. Kindly revert with the status of the issue, we'll be happy to assist you further.</span></span></span></p>

                    <p>Hello. I have a Microsoft account and email address. I have used this account for my son's xbox one. Now that he is getting older, I'd like to transfer the account, gametag and digital purchases for the Xbox to his microsoft account. I need to keep my email
 address as it is used for MS Office etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can transfer my xbox account only to my son? Thanks</p>

<p>Hi bluegum44,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately&nbsp;there is no way to dissociate an Xbox profile from the Microsoft Account used to create it. All of the data and progress, purchases, games&nbsp;etc. is tied to the Microsoft account and cannot be transferred to another Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><div>The best thing to do for this scenario is to add your son's email on your account as a secondary alias and then set it up as a sign in preference.
<div>1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=864833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>2. Under <strong>Add an alias</strong>, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new Outlook.com email address and add it as an alias.</li><li>Add an existing email address as an alias.</li></ul>
<p>3. Select <strong>Add alias</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. After you've added the email address,&nbsp;you'll be asked to verify that you're the account owner:&nbsp;
</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Verify </strong>next to the new alias. A&nbsp;message is sent to the account for verification.</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>After you receive the message, select the included link to confirm that you own the account.</span></span></span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>5. Under <strong>Sign-in preferences</strong>, select
<strong><span>Change sign-in preferences</span></strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>6. Either select the check boxes next to the aliases that you want to use to sign in or clear the check boxes for the aliases that you don’t want to use to sign in, and then select
<strong>Save</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
