<p>lever? unsure about that- but, at the blacksmith, isn't there a wall you can bust through? and which boss- pinwheel? I was thinkin you meant Nito. you don't have 1 homeward bone?

<p>you could die and go back to a bonfire if you're really stuck. sorry man, I'm confused as to where ya are myself. I don't even remember a blacksmith in the tomb of giants. &nbsp;only the skeleton one right before pinwheel. and I know I keep saying 'homeward bone'
 but warp and homeward bone are two different things. homeward bone is an item you should have in your inventory. if you beat pin wheel, you got at least 1 of em.

    <title>Windows Search problem&#58; &#34;These files can&#39;t be opened&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bzzman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Search problem&#58; &#34;These files can&#39;t be opened&#34; </h2>
                    Whenever I click the Start Orb in Windows 7, you know that search box that is in the menu? Yeah, it does not work. For example, I search "speech" because I sometimes use Speech Recognition for the fun of it, and all that comes up is Control Panel, but
 with no icon, just a blank page icon. What gives? It was working fine yesterday. Nothing done to system. Whenever you click it, Windows Security pops up. It says "These files can't be opened" and the message says, "Your Internet security setting prevented
 one or more files from being opened." CONTROL PANEL IS NOT ON THE INTERNET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS ON MY SYSTEM!!!!!!! I haven't even touched my internet settings 0-0. When I click "Why can't these files be opened?" link, Windows Help comes up. It says,"
<div>
Why can't I open or copy files from the web?
<p>It's probably because the site that the file comes from has been identified by<span>Windows</span> as potentially dangerous.<span>Windows</span> uses
<span>security zones</span> to determine whether or not a site is trusted. To learn more about trust and the Internet, seeWhen to trust a website .</p>
<span>security zones</span> to determine whether or not a site is trusted. To learn more about trust and the Internet, seeWhen to trust a website .</p>
<p><span>Windows</span> assigns all websites to one of four security zones: Internet, Local intranet, Trusted sites, or Restricted sites. The zone to which a website is assigned specifies the security settings that are used for that site.</p>
<div>
<p>The following table describes the four security zones.</p>
</div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>
<p>Zone</p>
</th>
<th>
<p>Description</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Internet</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The security level set for the Internet zone is applied to all websites by default. The security level for this zone is set to Medium High (but you can change it to either Medium or High). The only websites for which this security setting isn't used are
 those in the Local intranet zone or sites that you specifically assign to the Trusted or Restricted site zones.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Local intranet</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The security level set for the Local intranet zone is applied to content and websites that are stored on a corporate or business network. The security level for this zone is set to Medium (but you can change it to any level).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Trusted sites</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The security level set for Trusted sites is applied to sites that you specifically indicate to be ones that you trust not to damage your computer or information. The security level for this zone is set to Medium (but you can change it to any level).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Restricted sites</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The security level set for Restricted sites is applied to sites that might potentially damage your computer or your information. The security level for this zone is set to High and can't be changed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
To add or remove a site from a security zone
<ol>
<div>
<p>You can change security zone settings in Control Panel, but you shouldn't add aURL to the Trusted sites zone unless you're confident that the site in question is a trusted site.</p>
</div>
<li>
<p>Click the <span>Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcontent.windows.microsoft.com%2fBetterWhenConnectedHelpWS%2fGetContent.aspx%3fassetID%3d4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%26amp%3bdocumentSet%3den-US%26amp%3bProd%3dWIN700%26amp%3bMarket%3dUS" /> , click<span>Control
 Panel</span> , type <span>Internet options</span> in the search box, and then click<span>Internet Options</span> .</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Security</span> tab, click a security zone (<span>Local intranet</span> ,<span>Trusted sites</span> , or<span>Restricted sites</span> ), and then click
<span>Sites</span> .</p>
<span>Sites</span> .</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you clicked <span>Local intranet</span> in the previous step, click <span>Advanced</span> .</p>
</li><li>
<p>Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To add a site, type the URL into the <span>Add this website to the zone</span> box, and then click<span>Add</span> .</p>
</li><li>
<p>To remove a site, under <span>Websites</span> , click the URL for the website that you want to remove, and then click<span>Remove</span> ."</p>
</li></ul>
So what's happening??? </li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 device not showing up on the microsoft devices.</h2>
                    <p>When perform windows 10 free upgrade from windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Access to&nbsp;https://account.microsoft.com/devices</p>
<p>We can see devices activated with windows 10 shows up here. I can see several devices there, but not the devices I currently using now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: I have laptop that I name it <strong>AWH</strong> come with windows 8.1 OEM, and it upgrades to windows 10 home fine, see it in the list. I have purchased other windows 8.1 pro key and upgraded to windows 10 pro and I named it
<strong>AW&nbsp;</strong>only, but it only shows <strong>AWH</strong>, and not <strong>
AW</strong> on the list. So I don't want to lose my windows 10 home (OEM) and windows 10 pro. What would I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have other laptop, have windows 8.1 pro OEM, upgraded correctly to windows 10 pro (I name it
<strong>ins</strong>). When I fresh install windows 10 pro again to check the activation, I installed it on other partition. It activated successfully but with different name
<strong>DESKTOP-XXXXXX</strong>&nbsp;. But when I get into the device list in my MS account. I saw that it remove my
<strong>ins, </strong>and insert <strong>DESKTOP-XXXXXX</strong><strong>.</strong> So I know that is it, the same laptop. So I want to know, really, how does it works for the activation? &nbsp;I still use 2 windows 10 pro on 2 different partition, one name
<strong>ins </strong>that had already removed, other name&nbsp;<strong>DESKTOP-XXXXXX</strong>. How can I keep both of them?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have successfully activated all the 2 laptop with 2 windows 10 on different partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how could I know that all of the activated windows are saved/backed up on Microsoft activation server?
</p>
<p>1. There is nothing warranty that If I reinstall windows 10 PRO on the AW, it will activate.</p>
<p>2. There is warranty that on ins, I can activated windows 10 PRO but If install on 2 different partitions, it will not save other one.<br />

<p>For some reason, support came in and locked the thread. Kind of shady, honestly, since the issue is still unresolved.</p>

    <title>No audio&#59; possible driver problem. &#34;There are no mixer devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No audio&#59; possible driver problem. &#34;There are no mixer devices available.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot play any sounds on my computer: no CDs, no mp3s, no iTunes, no system sounds, nothing. When I try to open my sound mixer (Volume Control) it gives me the following error&nbsp;message:</p>
<p>"There are no mixer devices available. To install mixer devices, go to Control Panel, click Printers and Other Hardware, and then click Add Hardware. This program will now close."</p>
<p>I have tried adding hardware, uninstalling and reinstalling my drivers, checking hardware connections and power cords, rebooting, and ensuring everything relevant in services.msc is set to Automatic. Nothing has helped. Device Manager shows numerous devices
 (under Sound, video and game controllers) not working properly: Audio Codecs, Legacy Audio Drivers... SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio, etc. When I check the Properties of these devices, it gives the following message in Device status (General tab):</p>
<p>"A driver (service) for this device has been disabled.&nbsp; An alternate driver may be providing this functionality. (Code 32)"</p>
<p>They are enabled, so the only problem seems to be one or more drivers. But updating doesn't fix the problem and Windows Troubleshooting is useless.</p>
<p>I've been working with someone at Bleeping Computer to remove malware and we determined a few days ago that my machine was clean. The tech who was helping me said the audio problem is a separate issue from the malware, but I suspect the malware might have
 corrupted something or changed my settings. I thought it might have been caused accidentally by my use of AutoRuns (a few hours before I noticed the audio problem, and in the middle of the 9-day process of removing the malware) to turn off malicious programs
 that were auto-loading, but I can't find anything that looks audio-related that isn't set to auto-load at startup.</p>
<p>I did notice in AutoRuns that the driver aeaudio.sys is set to auto-load but in the Path column it says "File not found". I checked the system32 folder and it wasn't there at first, but then I found the file in two other folders and copied it to system32,
 yet AutoRuns still says it's not found. I tried rebooting to see if that would refresh it but it still says not found. I also fail to see how a problem with a driver (aeaudio.sys) that filters background noise (when recording sounds, right?) could knock out
 all my audio.</p>
<p>I've researched this problem for days and can find no answer to the problem. Please help.</p>
<p>Specs:<br />
Windows XP, SP3<br />
Dell Dimension 4600<br />
Sound card is SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio</p>

<p>msecox,</p>
<p>Bad news: the problem is hardware, not software. I tried&nbsp;installing a new sound card but&nbsp;it turned&nbsp;out that the part of my motherboard that controls sound was fried. You, too,&nbsp;may want to replace the&nbsp;sound card before condemning the sound controller. If
 that fails, your best bet is to replace the entire PC because a new motherboard will cost nearly $200 (plus labor if you can't install it yourself).</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

==========================================<br />
CDA is the format normally used on commercial audio (music) CDs.<br />
Your car CD Player should be compatible with commercial CDs.<br />
<br />
Anyway...you can convert the .cda files to .mp3 by ripping the CD<br />
using Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
Instructions are in the following article:<br />

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I copied a few files (maps) on&nbsp;my SD card of my car navigation system on windows 10. When I inserted the&nbsp;sd card back, it would display&nbsp;and read&nbsp;those files. When I use it on my laptop (windows 10). It shows everything.</p>
<p>Moreover, I copied a CD of my angiogram on my laptop (windows 10). When I visited my doctor to show him the CD, it was blank on windows 7 of my doctors PC.</p>
<p>Please some one help me.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Quick Access - Folders grouped separately sometimes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Quick Access - Folders grouped separately sometimes</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10, Quick Access is really great. I like the fluidity of it. Here's my question: sometimes (most of the time for me) folders are integrated into the list of recent files (20 recent files/folders), and sometimes folders are grouped separately (8
 recent folders, then 20 recent files). I can actually click on several folders and convince W10 to do the separate grouping. I prefer the separate grouping, but when I am mainly working in files, they go away and show files and folders together. Is there a
 way to default to show the folders grouped separately from the files. I'll try to post screen caps if that helps. Thanks!</p>

            <p>This happens due to corrupted saved folder views in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be fixed by deleting the keys that store folder views.&nbsp; If you don't mind losing all saved folder views, the fix is quick.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Registry Editor</li><li>Close all open File Explorer windows.</li><li>In Regedit, navigate to <strong>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell</strong></li><li>Delete the subkeys named <strong>BagMRU</strong> and <strong>Bags</strong>.</li><li>Close Regedit.</li><li>Right-click the Taskbar &amp; launch <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down to locate the <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> background process.</li><li>Right-click &amp; select <strong>Restart</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;That's it.&nbsp; Launching File Explorer should now show Quick Access in it's proper view.</p>

<h2>            Where can I download windows 8.1 64 bit iso file&#40;direct link&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Where can I download windows 8.1 64 bit iso file(direct link). I have the key from dreamspark. I cannot download windows 8.1 using secure download manager because it causes some problems when downloading. I wasted 2 days of my time and bandwidth. I have
 contacted the kivuto. Funny thing is they said I have to contact my institute. How can they help with my problem because they are not the software support. Anyway I contact them and they said the same thing.</p>
<p>Can anyone post a link where I can download the W 8.1 directly. So I can download it using free download manager. Please no more SDM replies. I'm done with SDM. Thank you.<br />
<br />
OT: Windows 8.1 64 bit iso&nbsp; </p>

<br />
As you have product key from dreamspark, you have to contact dreamspark for the issues related to installation. Microsoft does not have any direct link to download Windows 8.1.<br />

            Yeah. I contacted them several times. Those people don't care about it. They keep telling me to contact institute support. Why are those people developed a **** and forced us to use it. 95% of my friends have downloading issues because of this SDM. Even free download manager works fine. No wonder piracy still exists.

<p>I have checked the EA website, and all I can get is the Digital Download. If I'm going to be paying 54.99 for a game I want to be able to hold it in my hands. Trying to pre-order the 360 version just kicks me to their download store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment I have the regular edition, on disc, ordered for 27.99 from Amazon.co.uk</p>

 already got to get other things and gamestops preorder bonuses never seem to make their way to the marketplace.</span></strong></span></p>

<p>I think it might be a bit early for retailers to give out that sort of info. But there is a good chance EB/Gamestop, GAME, Amazon etc etc will have exclusive content just like last time, i mean look at there websites heaps of preorder games have content
 you can only get with ordering them early. </p>

<p>Yep. The game doesn't come out for like what, 9 months? Its still way too early for retailers to have the pre-order info. I'm betting there will be bonus armor just like with ME2 and the Terminus armor.

<p>I hope so. I still hate myself for not pre-ordering Mass Effect 2.</p>

<p>Bonsoir  tous. Voulant me dfouler un peu sur des jeux, je lance ma xbox, et oh ! surprise, lorsque j'appuie sur le bouton allumer tactile, a fait le bruit, mais rien d'autre. Je peux ouvrir et fermer le lecteur cd, et le rond vert est allum autour du
 bouton, et la lumire est verte sur le chargeur.<br />
A ct de a, mes manettes cherchent la xbox dans le vide, et ma tl ne dtecte rien. Je prcise qu'elle ne fait rien, mme quand je mets un cd dans le lecteur cd.<br />
<br />
Quelqu'un parmi vous aurait une ide sur comment rsoudre mon problme ?</p>

<p>salut  toi alors pour ton problme je ne sais pas trop mais te propose quelques soluce, 1) tes manettes sont-elles sans fil ? si oui et c'est ce que jense une manette sans fil peut ce mettre  clignoter car sois elle manque de batterie sois comme tu le
 dis cherche ta console hors je ne pense pas que ce sois car tes manettes ce coupent  l'extinction de la console donc elles sont bien visible par ta console, et pour ton affichage as-tu penser  changer de chaine avec le bouton tv/av de ta tlcommande tv
 jusqu' tomber sur l'emplacement rserver  l'hdmi ?</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What is the exact error it displays while removing/deleting files?</p>
<p>2) Are you the administrator of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes you cant delete a certain file or folder because you dont have appropriate permissions for it. In order to gain full permission of the file or&nbsp;folder, you need to change the&nbsp;ownership of the file and gain full control of it. Heres what you should
 do to get the full control of a certain folder or file:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on the file you want to delete and choose Properties</li><li>Under Security tab, click Advanced button</li><li>The Advanced Security Settings window will appear, and youll spot Owner</li><li>In some cases SYSTEM is listed as owner, and in some it is TrustedInstaller, click on Change option, next to the name of Owner
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Trustedinstaller is a Windows built-in account which removes and modifies updates and other Windows components. But you should be warned that if TrustedInstaller is listed as an owner of a certain file, you shouldnt change it. Because
 if you rename or delete the file your system may become unstable even more, so change the ownership from TrustedInstaller only if you know what youre doing.</li></ul>
</li><li>Enter the username you want to become the owner file, press Check Names to make sure if its okay, and press OK</li><li>Youll get back to the Advanced Security Settings window, but youll notice that name of the Owner&nbsp;has changed, and youll also notice a checkbox called Replace owner on subcontainers and &nbsp;objects, check that checkbox and click Apply</li><li>Close Windows Security Properties (Windows will require you to restart it)</li><li>Open the Properties again, by right clicking on the file, Security and then Advanced</li><li>Under Permission tab, check Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object</li><li>After that, click Edit</li><li>In Permission Entry window check Full Control and click OK</li><li>Try to delete file/folder again</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Please reply to us with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            My laptop won&#39;t resume after sleep&#47;hibernate or shutdown</h2>
                    My computer is stuck in sleep. I have to do a manual shutdown by pressing the power button. But&nbsp;when I try to restart, the fan spins, power lights are on, and I can hear the dvd drive spin. It doesn't boot, just a black screen. The hard drive light doesn't
 turn on. I have windows 7 and I haven't done any recent installs. My computer worked fine, never had any problems until now.

            Are you getting anything at all on the screen when you are booting up? It almost sounds like you've had a hardware failure of some sort if you are getting nothing at all.<br />

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message that you are seeing, the TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery).<br />
This behavior can occur for one or more of the following reasons:<br />
</p>
<p>1. You may need to install the latest updates for your display driver.<br />
2. Visual effects, or too many programs running in the background may be slowing your PC down.<br />
3. The Graphics device is taking more time than permitted to display graphics to your monitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the installed graphics device takes too long to respond, Windows will attempt to restart the device. If this happens too often or if it fails, then the TDR error will occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
In your case, the driver (idgkmd32.sys) for the installed Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3600 Series is causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the .NFO file you posted, you are using an outdated version of this driver. You can download and install the latest driver on the following website.</p>

Hi Adam</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are definitely the Intel drivers for the installed graphics device?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the following information&nbsp;on the download page for those drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Usage:<br />
</strong>These software drivers are generic versions and can be used for general purposes. However, computer original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may have altered the features, incorporated customizations, or made other changes to the software or software
 packaging they provide. To avoid any potential installation incompatibilities on your OEM system, Intel recommends that you check with your OEM and use the software provided by your system manufacturer.&nbsp;<strong>"</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
It may be that ASUS&nbsp;made changes to that device that requires custom drivers to be installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact&nbsp;ASUS support to get the custom drivers.</p>

            No :( New dirvers didn't solve anythyng. I think there is no way to make it works. Maybe after the update for windows 8.1 it will works, but i have problems with other drivers, so i returned to Windows 8(here don't works too).

    <title>Game freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whatyoudidthere  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game freezing</h2>
                    
<p>I've been trying to play Saint's Row, and Saint's Row 2, but after about 5 minutes in each game my console freezes. Sometimes the screen will go black or grey, and sometimes the picture just stops. The discs are clean and were working just last month, but
 all of a sudden they don't run anymore. All of &nbsp;my other games work just fine.</p>
<p>I've tried all the freeze fixes suggest by Microsoft. I have cleared my cache, plugged my console directly into a wall socket to provide more power, I keep it in a well ventilated area, I've cleaned out the inside with compressed air, I've tried downloading
 the games, I tried to play without the hard drive, and I've even tried reformatting my hard drive, nothing works.</p>
<p>I've tried searching for hours, but I can't seem to find anyone with a problem like mine. Does anyone know of anything that might help?</p>

<p>Hey mate, if you're having that issue with multiple games, and if you've tried all of the troubleshooting steps listed on support.xbox.com, then it sounds like your console will need a repair. You can set one up (and check your warranty status)

<h2>            NAP in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I've just recently realized that NAP has gone in windows 10.<br />
Before in windows 7, the NAP works just fine. I used NAP for 802.1x and health compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving forward, my company is going to upgrade all pcs and laptops using windows 10, and i'm a bit confused about this.</p>
<p>Any alternatives for windows 10 NAP? or anything that works exactly like NAP in windows 2012 R2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Network Access Protection (NAP) is not available anymore with Windows 10. It was deprecated due to lack of support and limited functionality. If you're looking for an alternative technology of NAP in Windows 10, it is better suited for the software
 developers on MSDN forum. We recommend that you post your question on <strong><a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MSDN forum</a></strong> for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other concern.</p>

            I an using Windows 7 Ultimate on this laptop. I have only had it for two weeks. It is not a browser problem as it can be reproduced with Firefox and Opera. I have booted in safe mode and have done all of the steps outlined above. I had a similar problem
 with my desktop, but that was fixable by going fare enough back in restore. I cannot do this with this unit as all of the restore points were corrupted. I have "upgraded" Windows7, but that did not fix it either. I know I can wipe the disk and start over,
 but I would rather not do that. It is likely a driver problem with some interface with the registry. However, I don't know.

<p>&nbsp;I have a problem that is bothering me. I have been on LIVE since 6 months after it came out. I didnt have a credit card so a friend told me he would use his card and i would pay him. I didnt know that he owned the tag. LIVE was still new. We stopped being
 friends for a couple yrs, in that time he cancelled my LIVE even tho i paid him for it. We ended up settling the differences, we have known each other for over 20 yrs. So i had to create another tag but this time in my name. I should have a 12 when you look
 at my profile. It means alot to me that it says that, but instead i have a 6. I have been an ongoing subscriber,this june will be 13 yrs. I would like to represent that. I dont want anything special, just for others to see that. I understand its a line of
 people that would have to want to change it for me. I see xbox employees and developers with additional badges on their profile, anything can be added or subtracted. Only a couple of things really matter to me when it comes to profile, and this is one of them.
 Please someone change this one thing for me? It just a matter of getting ahold of the right people. I was within the first million on LIVE, 6 months after launch and every year since. I have been on regular xbox since day one, 360 early,the xbox one since
 day one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. also put back the feature to rip cd's on xbox one....exactly the way it operated on 360. I have been using this option for 14 years and it is absent from the ONE. Without snapping to listen. I thought that was the greastest to listen to my music while
 hearing all sound effects and cancelling original game music...Brilliant!! I currently snap my 360 and play the music from that. I already voted on forum.</p>

<p>Well, first, if you had read the COC and TOU, you would have found that what you had done with your first account was actually against the rules. "Do not lend, transfer, sell, or otherwise provide access to your account." Since he owned it, and you used
 it, you were breaking the rules. For the same reason, as well as others, there is no way that the tenure from that first account can be added to your current account. I suggest that you explain it in your bio.

<p>I did not lend ,transfer,sell or provide access. If you take the time to read my post like i took the time to write it, then you would understand that. It is no way illegal either. I had my own password that he did not know. It was just the fact that it
 was paid on his card gave him control which is BS. I didnt have a card and knew nothing about internet. He offered as a gesture to help out so we can game together</p>

<p>Your tenure will only represent how long that tag has been on live as a gold subscriber,not how long you have been on live.</p>
<p>I have been on live since 2003 but made another gamertag for the 360 so my tenure is 7 years,not 12.</p>
<p>No one can add the tenure from one account to another.</p>
<p>Sorry but your just going to have to live with your tenure as it is.</p>
