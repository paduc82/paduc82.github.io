<h2>            Casual word Games won&#39;t sync</h2>
                    MS Casual Word Games won't sync data from the cloud. This has been going on since 03 Sept regardless of which device I use and log in to. I am unable to play current games and store data. I have done all the usual work arounds and fixes to no avail. Anyone
 else? Please help!! Thanks.

            Nope, no response whatsoever from them, no surprise. Really don't think they care. Its happened before and it'll happen again, that's what we get for playing their free games I suppose.

<p>I am having the same issue, for several months I haven't been able to sign into either of the casual games (Solitaire and Mahjong).&nbsp; When I try to start the game it tries to sign in automatically but then I get an error message (1170000), I have tried pressing
 the retry button (repeatedly) and it has no effect. &nbsp;</p>

            So we are all commiserating in the same situation, isn't that just wonderful. (much sarcasm intended). I know we all enjoy playing these games but man does it ever get frustrating when they don't work and there isn't a dang thing that can be done!! All
 the fixes that are suggested don't do a thing so I'm of the opinion that the issues are on their end but do they really care?? I don't think so.

            Yea, I've tried that too and for sure it does sync. Trouble is I've been playing a very long time under the "FunnierOrange1" ID and have (make that had) a ton of history that I've
 machines that I try and use the same log in for and it works sporadically - some times on one but not the other and vise versa. Just really sketchy hence the frustration, makes no sense.

<p>Given the number of people involved and the amount of time it's been going on, I would have to say that it is on their end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It amazes me that a company that makes a program like this can't find a solution to this problem.&nbsp; I find it very hard to believe that with all the people that they have access to they don't have a better suggestion than to create a new account and see if
 that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also why in the name of common sense would it work on one device and not another?&nbsp; They tout this "single sign-in" option by saying you can synch all your windows devices, yet obviously that doesn't work either.</p>

            The more I think about all of this the more upset I become. Here's my point - in this situation much like any other "tech support" scenario the default mode seems to be that the customer has made a mistake or done something wrong. And while that may be
 more often the case than not the responder needs to be MUCH more considerate. I say this as a 25 plus year member of the customer support world, most of it working with US military personnel on VERY complex situations, many of them pilots and senior NCOs and
 officers. The most important thing I learned was to always take those folks seriously and to treat them with the utmost respect. In just about every case they had already tried ALL the basic stuff I was prepared to throw out and they were very frustrated and
 ready to have someone pull out a "MacGyver" and fix the whole mess. So come on MS, do us all a solid and really look into what is obviously a very real problem that is CLEARLY on your end an d come up with a REAL fix and not some silly ba

            You might want to check your settings on Windows 10 or in the Microsoft Store to see some syncing part for the cloud. Or consider updating your game.

<h2>            New Skype for Desktop, detach chat windows</h2>
                    <p>Today I've been forced to upgrade to Skype for Desktop, I use Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run 3 monitors and 4 desktops.&nbsp; Can someone explain how I can take a chat window with me to another monitor/ desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a single window interface.&nbsp; Of course this can't be true, we're almost in 2020 and this is Skype for Desktop, not Skype for Tablet, I must have missed something...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Skype interface seems essentially unusable for me.&nbsp; Is it correct that to chat to someone I must return to the monitor&nbsp;and desktop Skype is running on?&nbsp; This can't be true.</p>

            Hello Vodkaneats 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />Try splitting your window view in Skype to achieve that.
<br />
<br />Split window view lets you put your contact list in one window, and each conversation you open in a separate one. You can drag your contact, and conversation windows anywhere on your screen to really personalize the way you use Skype.
<br />

            Many thanks for your reply.&nbsp; That is very useful to know.&nbsp; When I eventually upgrade to Win 10, I will look forward to this feature.&nbsp; Do you know if it will be coming to Skype for Desktop?&nbsp; As I use Win 7.

<p>Just to give some feedback, I tried that version for awhile because I really needed the split windows. It was really garbage. I don't recommend it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I think at this point it is just best to give up on Skype completely. The developers don't really have much interest in our feedback.</p>

            <p>I have done several things like memory checks and system file checks and they are all clean. When I boot the PC clean then I have no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several reboots, I have managed to narrow down the problem to a driver from Apple's Bootcamp v5.1.5621 called keyagent.sys v4.0.2.0 size 18208 bytes. This is the cause of this problem.</p>

<div>Hi <strong>Nguyen419</strong>,<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot these issues follow the steps given in order:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Resynchronize your device with the receiver.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To resynchronize the mouse or the keyboard with the receiver, follow these steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>When you synchronize the mouse or the keyboard with the receiver, put the device near the receiver and put any other wireless keyboards and mouse at least 6 feet away.<br />
Press the button on the receiver, and then verify that the light on the receiver starts to blink.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Some newer Microsoft devices are permanently bound to their receiver and cannot be reset. If your device does not have a button, skip to Method 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If a dialog box appears on the screen in several seconds, follow the instructions that appear on the screen. Otherwise, go to the next step.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Press and release the Connect Channel button on the bottom of the mouse or the keyboard.</div>
<div>b. Check the green light on the receiver. A steady green light means the synchronization was successful. If the problem persists, try steps 1 through 4 again.</div>
<div>c. For the Wireless Notebook mouse: This issue can occur if the micro-switch on the bottom of the mouse is not released. Use a pin or a pen to try to release the button if it is depressed.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2: Try different ports</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To determine whether the problem is related to the ports on the computer, use only the two cables that are included with the wireless desktop receiver, or the single cable that is included with a mouse.</div>
<div><br />
Also follow the steps mentioned in the link below:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Troubleshoot response failures in wireless keyboard or mouse</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398/en-us</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3: Configure the Bluetooth Device on the Computer.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to do this, make sure that the Bluetooth service is started.</div>
<div><br />
Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in for Services. To do this, follow these steps.</div>
<div><br />
Windows Vista or Windows 7</div>
<div><br />
a.&nbsp; Click Start, copy and then paste (or type) the following command in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER:<br />
services.msc<br />
b.&nbsp; In the Programs list, click Services. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;•&nbsp; Double-click the Bluetooth Support service.<br />
&nbsp;•&nbsp; If the Bluetooth Support service is stopped, click Start.<br />
&nbsp;•&nbsp; On the Startup type list, click Automatic.<br />
&nbsp;•&nbsp; Click the Log On tab.<br />
&nbsp;•&nbsp; Click Local System account.<br />
&nbsp;•&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;•&nbsp; If you prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4: How to connect the Bluetooth device to the computer</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Press and hold the Connect button on the bottom of the mouse. If your device has a battery indication light, it will blink and alternate between red and green to indicate that the device is discoverable.</div>
<div>b. On the computer, open the Bluetooth software. The Bluetooth software is typically located in Control Panel. For more information about opening the Bluetooth software, see the "How to open the Bluetooth software" section.</div>
<div>c. Click the Devices tab, and then click Add.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.</strong></div>
<div><br />
A Microsoft Bluetooth mouse does not require a passkey to connect to the computer. If you are prompted for a passkey, select No passkey. If you do not get the No Passkey option, try to enter 0000 as a passkey by using your keyboard.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Refer the following link for more information:</strong></div>

<h2>            After upgrading Win7 to Win10 a lot of crashes, freezes and very long reboots</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not too long ago I have upgraded my Win7 to Win10 and everything looked nice. After win 10 come up I have installed some drivers, windows updates and the system asked for a reboot. The reboot was about 30 min. I figured, with all of the upgrades it is understandable.
 Now I have been running on windows 10 for over a month. I noticed&nbsp;if I&nbsp;click power / shutdown the computer shuts off within 10-20 sec, very fast. When I&nbsp;hit the power button the windows log in screen comes up just as fast, 5-10 sec max, as matter effect it
 comes up faster then win7 did. However, when I do restart, it takes forever (20 minutes or so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes the system maybe 10 - 15 sec to shut off, then I see my BIOS loading for about 5 sec tops,&nbsp;then I get the black screen with windows logo in the center and below are the progress&nbsp;&nbsp;dots spinning. The system will sit like that 15 - 20 minutes. When
 I look at the box&nbsp;the HD LED occasional blinks, just sits there. After 20 minutes or so the HD LED light start to light up, I can see and hear the HD crunching and probably with in 10 sec of that I am at the log in screen. I put my credentials in and the windows
 loads up very quick. At this point I have updated or re installed all of the drivers / software, a lot of NVidia drivers updates&nbsp;I looked on line for tips and have not found any KB that talk about my issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why if I shutdown then power on the PC it comes up so fast, yet when I do reboot, it takes 20 min or so? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />
Tom</p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>"yet when I do reboot, it takes 20 min or so?", do you see any message saying loading updates or installing updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, you may follow the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1: We would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website to check for the latest BIOS version &amp; chipset driver and install it to check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>BIOS Disclaimer:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from
 booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Method 2:
</span></span><span><span>You may run the SFC and DISM by following the below link and check if it helps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>SFC: System File Checker</span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>DISM: It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available.

<p>
</p><p>Method 3: If the issue still persist, <span>
I suggest you to boot the&nbsp;computer in Clean Boot and restart the system in clean boot. Once you restart, the computer again boots into clean boot, it helps us to check if any third party applications are causing this issue. After checking boot the time, you
 may </span><span>refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the below link to boot to normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows
 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></p>

<p><span>What seems to make a difference is that if I go to control panel, power options and turn off “Turn on faster startup” the reboots and shutdowns take about 20 or so minutes. With this option ON, shutdowns

</span><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/508050/difference-between-shutting-down-and-turning-on-vs-restart-in-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://superuser.com/questions/508050/difference-between-shutting-down-and-turning-on-vs-restart-in-windows-8</span></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>From what I see the extremely long wait is right after BIOS loads and before windows loads. Once the windows loads after a reboot and I log into OS, all my startup programs, including icons on the
 desktop load supper fast. The HD activity screams for 2-3 seconds and CPU utilization drop down to nothing, system is ready to go. Whereas after a reboot, once I log in to the OS, I see a lot of HD activity and it takes about 30 – 45 sec for all of the programs
 to load, including desktop icons. Not sure what to make out of it. If there are other things to try or troubleshooting steps, I am all for it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me know,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Deepak,</span></p>
<p><span>So after searching all over online and trying many different recommendations, testing and troubleshooting tips the behaviors was the same. Reboots were super long and I would get around 3 – 4 freezes
 throughout the day for no reason, even when the system was sitting at idle. </span>
</p>
<p><span>The conclusion I draw was that there are too many OS files, program files, shared libraries, drivers etc. &nbsp;that could be part of the problem. So if any time, now is the time to whack it the system
 clean and started it fresh.</span></p>
<p><span>I inventory my system, did my backups and took an image of my system, just in case. Once I found out that I can use Win7 or 8 activation key for win 10 clean install, I downloaded Win 10 ISO image
 from Microsoft and just went for it. </span></p>
<p><span>After booting to bootable DVD with win 10 on it, I have selected the clean install. My system had 3 partitions, OEM from Dell, systems and primary, so I have deleted all of them and then created 1
 new partition C:\. The wizard created the system partition automatically and the primary C:\ as expected. Next I reformatted the new C:\ partition and let the Win 10 do its thing. About 30 – 40 minutes later the process was done and after creating my new ID
 I was in. New OS setup comes a long ways from Win NT days, so most of the drivers for my hardware were already installed by the wizard.</span></p>
<p><span>For the rest of the Sunday I just kept installing my software, patching with Microsoft updates, configuring to my specs. At the end, yes it took a whole day but the results are amazing.</span></p>
<p><span>Today is 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> day without a single freeze or crash and shutdowns or reboots take a few seconds as it should be.
 I am actually shocked that without any hardware changes I can copy files from my NAS at 100 MB/s whereas before if I hit 30 MB/s I thought it was rocking.</span></p>
<p><span>Lesson learned, expecting OS in use for several years to be upgraded and have no issues, it is unrealistic considering how much junk gets loaded by the manufacture right out of the box and all of
 the **** on line. Do yourself a favor, do your homework, back y our stuff and whack it clean.
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for trying to help me out and I hope this helps the next guy.</span></p>

            <p>05/18/2016 Follow up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So after I wrote the&nbsp;last update couple of weeks ago, my first windows 10 freeze, then crash came about&nbsp;2 days later, when I was installing google chrome. System rebooted then&nbsp;on the second try I was able to install it without any issues. All together I
 probably get a 1 freeze every 1 or 2 days, instead of 3-4 times a day. Yesterday the computer was just sitting at idle. I don't use any hibernation, or sleep settings and next thing&nbsp;I&nbsp;know my secondary monitor goes black screen and the primary is frozen. When
 I press the num lock on my keyboard the light stays on. After a minute I just hold the power button till computer shuts off. Not sure what to make out of this but the reboots are quick as they supposed to be, so at least 1 thing so far seem to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am open to any suggestions.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have changed my power plan long time ago to High Performance, that's the only way I roll.&nbsp;all of the sleep modes, hibernation are set to never. In addition, I am using Microsoft wired keyboard 200 and come to find out it also has a sleep mode which was
 causing problems so that has been turned off as well.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Update 06/12/2016.</p>
<p>So it has been few weeks since my last update. Computer does seem to freeze once a day then automatically reboots. The reboots are quick 2-3 min and I am back in. Couple of things that I have noticed is that sometimes computer freezes and reboots with in
 10-30 min sometimes it take an hour for the freeze and reboot. Once that computer comes back I can work 12 - 15 hours and everything works fine as it supposed without any issues. I have also noticed that NVidia&nbsp;has been releasing a lot to driver updates. I
 think within last month or so they have released 5&nbsp;driver updates. The video card in my PC is GeForce GT 630 and the driver version is 368.39 release date 06/07/2016. This is dual video card and it really seems that is something up with the Win 10 and NVidia
 drivers. </p>

<p>I'm sure it'd be possible since they have a whole different team that designs zombies. I'm sure if that whole team decided to quit and start their own company under an Activision publishing contract, they'd do it. And it'll still be good. But of course,
 they won't quit and do that since Treyarch needs them to keep the Zombies story-line going.</p>

<p>That's the problem though. See, zombies would be good as its own game since it has its own story, and own type of play. Multiplayer as itself just wouldn't make sense in my eyes.</p>

<p>If they sold a stand alone arcade version of Zombies which allows you to connect to people who have the full Retail version of CoD to play Zombies with them, I would probably actually buy it, except it would probably be 1600-2000 MSP knowing Activision,
 and then I would wait for it to be 50% off.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you have mentioned that you want to know the ways to fix runtime broker.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Runtime Broker is a Windows process in Task Manager that helps manage permissions on your PC for apps from Windows Store. It should only use a few megabytes of memory, but in some cases, a faulty app might cause Runtime Broker to use up to a gigabyte
 of RAM or more.<br />
If your RAM use is high and your PC is running slowly, an app may be the cause of the problem. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager and then, on the Processes tab, check to see how much memory Runtime Broker is using. If it’s using more than 15% of your
 memory, you probably have an issue with an app on your PC. To stop Runtime Broker from using so much memory, select Runtime Broker in the list, select End task to close Runtime Broker, and then restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>If still the issue persist suggest OP to run in-built system maintainace troubleshooter and check-- give appro steps;</p>
<p>1) go to control panel.</p>
<p>2)<span>Select Troubleshooting</span> <br />
3)<span>On left pane, select View all.</span> </p>
<p>4)<span>Select system maintaince and run the troubleshooter</span> .
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information will be helpful for you. Keep us posted on the status of the issue and I’ll be glad to assist you further<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

            I updated from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Pro and now the runtimebroker.exe is using 10-15% CPU and 10-15 Mb RAM when the computer is idling. Including other background processes this means my computer is running at a constant minimum of 25% CPU when idling
 and my fan is working pretty hard to keep it cool. This is modern core i7 processer and should not be running this hard at idle. Will you log this as a bug? Doing system maintaince doesn't help. I will do a clean install to see if that fixes it.

            Having the same problem. RunTime Broker starts running and consumes so much CPU it takes minutes for Task Manager to come up.&nbsp; I end the process and the systems is fine for awhile.&nbsp; Another thread said turn off "Show me tips about Windows" and I did that
 and it did not help.<br />

            <p>Awesome. Turning off "Show me tips about Windows" <em>immediately </em>dropped average CPU usage from about 40% to 5%. Runtimebroker.exe was the process taking so much CPU.</p>

            I tried disabling all the notifications and still had the run time broker consume CPU.&nbsp; On my PC it is consuming so much that it takes a couple of minutes to run Task Manager to get it working.&nbsp; After ending the process I may go for about an hour before
 it is back.&nbsp; I've checked to see if other apps as the "Store" are running and they are not.&nbsp; There was a post about "Choose How Updates are Delivered" and I turned off the "When this is turned on, your PC may also send parts of previously downloaded Windows
 updates and apps to PC's on your local network, or PCs on the Internet, depending on what's selected below"&nbsp; This was by default on and I turned it off as someone posted that this could be some P2P background work burning CPU.&nbsp; That did not work.&nbsp; I did the
 register change that is in this thread and that has topped my problem and I have not seen any ill affects.&nbsp; It would be nice to hear from someone at Microsoft on what I a may be getting/not getting w

As first I didn't knew where to post this Q.<br />
Yes, it looks for forums over the web.</p>

Q:&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Where

I tried many forums and everywhere was told - look at exported TTE - but really - I'm not any fatal newbie in Windows and I&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">found

So,&nbsp;<strong>can anybody tell me where to find private characters to backup it?</strong></p>

My&nbsp;<strong>suggestion</strong>&nbsp;for future updates of&nbsp;<strong>EUDCEDIT</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>add

<h2>            running windows 7- suddenly voices sound like chipmunks.</h2>
                    I closed my computer on Friday,and when I opened it today, the voices on the youtube sounded like chipmunks. I researched this on line, but the advice was difficult to follow. I could not find where to slow down hardware acceleration, or change advanced
 settings that they were recommending, as if everyone had some version of Windows that I don't have. (I have 7)
<div>Please help.</div>

&nbsp; network websites, net flux, Hulu...<br />
-I have two options for resolution, 1920x1080 and 1280x720, at the first resolution all icons and menus are off the screen at the lower resolution the apps on the metro tiles will not open.<br />

            I am having somewhat of the same issue. Except when i want to change my resolution in pc settings under devices for my acer monitor, I cannot move the slider that changes the resolution. and it is stuck at 1024x728 and everything on the screen looks like
 it is blown up. i didn't start having the problem until I reset my pc to factory defaults. Everything looks 2 time bigger than it was before. The only thing i can think to do is updating drivers, that doesn't work. it causes games to lagg and to have bad quality.&nbsp;

<h2>            Error 1797 - &#34;That didn&#39;t work...&#34; window while installing printer</h2>
                    <p>We recently got an Epson SureColor T3270 and got it installed on a computer in our office. It comes with software that is required for the printer to actually print things correctly (this software is called AccuRIP Black Pearl SE). It only allows installation
 on one computer without causing problems with the print queue. We have it installed on one computer and have been able to connect a couple of our computers through shared printer installation as a workaround for that issue. However, the rest of our computers
 give error code 1797 when attempting to add the printer with a window that says "<span>That didn't work.&nbsp;</span>We can't install this printer right now<span>. Try again later or contact your network administrator for help."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've installed the printer's driver from the Epson website and even attempted installing a printqueue.inf as it asks for a driver in the .inf format to work. It gets partly through and then gives us a basic error window stating it cannot continue with
 installation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas what else we can try? I feel like it would've been easier for us to figure out if we hadn't been able to get it to work at all but it's currently working on 3 of the 8 computers we've tried.</span></p>

            Things to try.
<br />
<br />Check that the following services are running and if they are restart them.
<br />
<br />RPC
<br />SSDP
<br />UPnP
<br />HTTP (if you have it) - if not go to elevated command prompt and type 
<br />net start http
<br />
<br />Turn off firewall
<br />Turn off antivirus
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.

 Prompt (Admin)") to enter the following&nbsp;5 lines&nbsp;(you can copy and paste each line using your mouse or touchpad):</p>
<p>
</p><p>icacls "C:\Program Files" /save \progacl.txt</p>
<p>mkdir "D:\Program Files"</p>
<p>icacls D:\ /restore \progacl.txt</p>
<p>icacls "D:\Program Files" /setowner "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller"</p>
<p>del \progacl.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this does is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Create&nbsp;temporary text file progacl.txt&nbsp;containing a copy of the folder permissions.&nbsp; Note if you want to change the name of your program folder on the 2nd drive you can edit this file (type notepad \progacl.txt) and change the folder name (top line)&nbsp;to
 whatever you want (such as "ProgFiles" or "2nd Program Files").</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Create your new program folder.&nbsp; Make sure you create it on the&nbsp;drive you want (such as D:, W:, etc.) and name it the same as what is in your progacl.txt file.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have already created the folder skip this command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Restore folder permissions for the matching folder on the D drive.&nbsp; Again, make sure you use the drive letter you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Set the owner to TrustedInstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Delete the progacl.txt file.&nbsp; This step isn't actually required but if you're like me you want to clean up and delete anything you don't need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, another option is to open Notepad and copy/paste the&nbsp;5 lines above in (making sure to press "enter" at the end of the last line) and save this as "Create&nbsp;Program Files on D.bat" somewhere (perhaps create a folder called "Setup" in your OneDrive so you
 can use it with other PCs you've added drives to).&nbsp; Now&nbsp;right click on the batch file and select "Run as administrator" to create D:\Program Files with the correct permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW2, I'm sure there is a powershell command that can do this in one step by piping get-acl and set-acl together (it might require another second command to set the owner).&nbsp; Perhaps a powershell expert could post how to do this and provide a breakdown of
 the command.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t place icons on the bottom of the screen, if no icons above them</h2>
                    <p>Hi, guys! I've been having a very strange problem for quite some time now. A few weeks ago, I pressed some key combination after which I can no longer place icons on the lowest row of my Desktop, UNLESS there's and icon above it... It happened when I was
 using Windows 8.1, after that I upgraded to Windows 10, and then I clean installed Windows 10 again, but the problem still stands. Here's a screenshot to show you what I'm talking about:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/693636a2-fd18-4bff-924b-09653cafa642" /></p>
<p>I tried decreasing the vertical icon spacing, tried changing the "size of text, apps, and other items" from 125% to 100%, and then it worked for a second, but then I placed an icon next to the Recycle Bin and I was back where I started.</p>
<p>Please, help me, because it's really bugging me! Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>I too have this problem, the problem occurs when I set the display at 125% magnification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A work around to this problem that I've found is to change the magnification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Right click on your desktop and click on "Display settings"</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Move the slider under "Change the size of text, apps, and other items:" to 100%</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully you will be able to place your icons anywhere on the screen, however the icons might be too small to see comfortably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this is not a fix, Microsoft really needs to look into this, its been 5 months since I got Win10 and this problem's been there since the beginning.</p>

<p>I'm sure it is well into development and it'll probably be out in early 2012 or summer 2012 seeing as how Rockstar has a habit of releasing stuff near summer(RDR, LA Noire). My theory is that it's going to take place in Australia and Packie McReary will
 be the main character. He mentions wanting to go to Australia in GTA IV and at the end of TBoGT, you see him at the airport with a suitcase. Though he could be going to Vice City or San Andreas.</p>

<h2>            Skype Number</h2>
                    <p>I currently have a Skype number set up on my personal Skype account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we have recently set up a new business and we can to use our Skype account in the business name, but keep the same number, as well as adding an additional number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the reading I've done it doesn't look like its possible to transfer the number - does anyone have any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if we cancel the current subscription (our Skype number), would we then be able to purchase the same number under the new account?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/eef2c619-fd30-488e-8dc3-c0db4986482a" title="AdamFinch1">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype subscriptions including Skype Number are non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you will cancel your current subscription, it will be reserved for 90 days on the same Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that the 90 days have passed, there is no guaranty that you will be able to get the same number regardless of which account you will use to purchase a Skype Number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have to get a new Skype Number which you will use for your business account since transfer is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that answers your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>

<br />Check whether status of the order is delivered or not in Purchase History? If this is delivered, sign out of Skype and sign in again.

<br />If the balance still doesn't reflect, then try to make a call. If order is delivered and balance is not reflecting, forcing call makes it to appear.

            You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support to get the credit reflected.
