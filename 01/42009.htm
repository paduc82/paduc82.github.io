<h2>            Windows 7 not recognizing FAT32 formatted devices &#47; Windows asks to format any USB device formatted with FAT32</h2>
                    <p>I have a question concerning Windows not recognizing USB devices formatted in FAT32.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest symptom is Windows asking to format any device that has FAT32 (the file format shows as RAW in Disk Management. The format will fail unless NTFS is used (which is unacceptable for SD cards used in cameras etc.)
</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite P755 with one USB 3 port and three USB 2 ports running Windows 7 64bit. Apparently computer type and for the most part device type is irrelevant regarding this issue after doing&nbsp;some exhaustive research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I have tried SFC / SCANNOW with no results</p>
<p>2. I&nbsp;uninstalled all USB drivers and SD card device drivers with no results </p>
<p>3. I created a new profile and moved my files over with no results </p>
<p>4. I searched the net and found a plethora of people with the same problem on multiple versions of Windows but no confirmed fix.</p>
<p>5. I tried the Microsoft hardware troubleshooter fix with no result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The devices I used are pen drives, flash drives, multiple types of SD cards, and external hard drives. These devices are confirmed to work on several other computers in different windows configurations. When formatted to NTFS they all will work but as I
 stated before, the SD cards will not work in cameras etc. in the NTFS format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think wiping the computer and starting over isn't solving the problem. After conducting research, I discovered this problem has been around for many years and followed from Windows XP all the way through Windows 8 according to&nbsp;the forums and blogs I read.
 I'm surprised Microsoft doesn't have a fix for this yet. </p>

            <p>Hello and sorry about the delay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried this previously with the same results. My pen drives and SD card worked great until the problem occured. Windows 7 lost the ability to recognize FAT32 devices.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I found the problem though. My pen drive must have failed in some way. After confirming all my media were working properly on a spare desktop computer running windows 7 64, I popped in a sansa disk thumb drive and thats when I started to get errors
 on this computer as well. This time no data survived. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back to my laptop and formatted it with a new copy of windows professional 64bit. The laptop runs great and recognizes all the FAT32 media I throw at it. I am not using the suspect USB drive for fear it might cause the problems again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so far so good a couple of weeks later. Everything is running great. I've used many different FAT32 media with no problems. I am pretty sure it was the drive. I guess the fact that it worked intermittenly masked the fact that it was the cause of the
 problems. Strange that it would cause windows to reject FAT32.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Pro 64bit DVD and 0xc0000225 error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joedigiovanni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Pro 64bit DVD and 0xc0000225 error</h2>
                    <p>I got the Windows 8 Pro 64bit DVD (part of an upgrade product that also includes the 32bit DVD, SKU 3UR-00001).&nbsp; I previously had Windows XP Home Ed., but my computer is definitely 64bit capable. In fact I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit in a separate
 partition.</p>
<p>However, when I boot up with the 64bit DVD, I get a "0xc0000225" error code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there a way to start up the install from the DVD with a more verbose setting, to see exactly where the “0xc0000225" happens?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is the DVD in the upgrade package not designed to be run on bootup; rather, run only in an earlier Windows instance?&nbsp; If so, that's a problem, since I do NOT have a 64bit Windows
 available.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I've seen many references in the support forum to creating an ISO - either&nbsp;from download or the DVD - is this only possible with certain versions of the Windows 8 Pro DVD?&nbsp; If
 it is possible with the upgrade DVD, what's the procedure?</strong></p>
<p>I've tried&nbsp;unplugging all peripherals/USB devices except my keyboard and mouse, as&nbsp;suggested on a Technet forum post, but no luck.</p>
<p>The only BIOS update available is just to add support for HDD &gt; 2 TB - not applicable to me.</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; On other threads about this error code, with Windows 7 and 8, I saw references to ACPI - I've already enabled ACPI in BIOS, and also tried install with it disabled, with no luck.</p>
<p>This upgrade really has been painful (admittedly, only because I have the audacity to want to use a 64bit OS on a 64bit processor!).</p>

            We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
<br />

None of the usual function key boot options work...perhaps since Windows 8 isn't yet installed, and I'm booting off the DVD.
<div><br />
<div>I've tried both "fail safe" and "optimized" BIOS options - no change. &nbsp;Oddly, on one boot up, I did get the initial screen with options to install or repair, and I chose install, which yielded the BSOD (error code unknown - it rebooted automatically too
 fast). &nbsp;I haven't been able to get this menu yet again, to test the repair option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The \Windows\Minidump steps aren't a player since Windows 8 isn't yet installed. &nbsp;A now busted Windows XP HE SP3 is on the target partition.</div>

            Note that I eliminated the STOP error by disabling the overclocking option in hardware (I have an MSI mb with a "Genie" overclock button). &nbsp;I finally got Windows 8 Pro 64bit installed, but had to repartition my drive to put the Windows 8 partition first.
 &nbsp;Luckily Ubuntu is OK with being on the second partition. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi Rudy,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response. Turns out this issue is due to the UCIMAPI.EXE file located in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing that from ucimapi.exe to ucimap.exe.old appears to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I randomly stumbled across this after carrying out more steps this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps your other clients too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<h2>            Address Bar not showing in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
&nbsp; I cannot get my address bar in windows explorer to display. I did go to view -&gt; toolbars -&gt; address bar and all I get is a box in the corner that says address. Does anyone know how to resolve this?<br />
<br />
Thank you!

            So you do have the Address Bar checked? Go back to View&gt;Toolbars and unlock the toolbars. Now go over to the corner where you see "Address" and pull to the left. The address bar is just jammed over to the right.

            Hi Hector, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Hardware and Devices. Run the troubleshooter to see if it detects and installs the USB controllers.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, see if you can find them in Device Manager:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your USB controller in the list. It may have a yellow or red warning indicator.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

</p><p>Take note that you can still use the subscription until it expires after cancelling it. If you don't see the cancel subscription option, it means that the subscription is already cancelled. This means that your subscription will no longer recur or renew&nbsp;after
 it expires.</p>

            A "USB" driver by itself really doesn't exist..The MB hardware "Chipset" software/driver contains USB/Video/Audio/etc functions to the Win OS to run all.The pc mfg downloads get you going,but the pc hardware mfg (Intel/AMD/etc) will have current drivers.Write
 down the chipset data from pc&nbsp;mfg,then go to hardware mfg for current....

            <i>SPFILEQ.dll&nbsp;</i> is not part of Direct X. I believe it is another form of Windows system file.<br />
- What program were you installing or using when this error started ? <br />
Is what you are trying to install or launch from a download ? If so where from ?<br />
<i>- SPFILEQ.dll&nbsp; </i>in conjunction with Bad Image sounds like the installer for the program may be corrupt, or the program was downloaded from a suspect site leading to your machine possibly
<br />
contracting a malware.<br />
<br />
Also read the posts from <i>Bleepin' fireman</i> below (particularly post # 24 regarding follow up<br />
to removing and avoiding malware. <br />
Note the Oldtimer&nbsp; (- OTL-)&nbsp; linked in the reply tool&nbsp; 'cleans' the Temp folders, and only the Temp<br />
folders , but perhaps more thoroughly than CCleaner, or Windows Disk Cleanup).<br />

<i>"cc cleaner to clean registry and other files"</i><br />
<br />
While doing a search for&nbsp; <i>SPFILEQ.dll&nbsp; </i>may come up with a lot of pages that suggest your<br />
registry is corrupt they should not be trusted. <br />
Depending on what registry entries CCleaner deleted, doing so may do more harm than good.<br />
CCleaner is good for the other stuff it does, but no registry cleaner is fail-safe.<br />

<i><span><font color="#000000">"As with Windows 7 you have the latest DirectX (11), no updates are necessary. If necessary, you can install DirectX 9 for some games which cannot handle 11.</font></span>"</i><br />
<br />
btw -&nbsp; Win7 has DX 9, 10 and 11, <i>not</i> just DX 11,&nbsp; but DX does need to be updated using the<br />
Direct X Web Installer when the installation is new as Win7 does not install with all DX files.
<br />
- Win7 will run games which use DX9 when newly installed, but as with DX 10 and 11 there
<br />
are some files for DX9 that&nbsp; are not installed with Windows.<br />
This can result in games or programs that require a specific DX file (eg - d3dx9_42.dll)&nbsp; not being able to run&nbsp; should that file not be installed yet.<br />

            Sorry for this late reply, I cannot install (update) DX 9 from the dxwebsetup.exe file downloaded from microsoft.com, also recently I started receiving another error regarding Computer-manage section.<br />
"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools\Computer Management.ink<br />
Unspecified error."<br />
<br />
And I tried to burn a DVD with some pictures I have in my PC and I can't, it seems that Windows burner is not designed for my OS.<br />
I don't get it because I have Windows 7 64-bit but seems that my windows can't get that, which is weird.<br />
I will try to show you some of the errors with screenshots.<br />
The first error regarding that system file as you say started when I installed Sanctum2 from the Steam client. I don't think it's related. Also I used CCleaner and it didn't do that much help.<br />

<br />
Edit<br />
I tried to repair it by booting up to windows 7 DVD and launch the repair tool but it didn't do that much either, my system seems just fine to boot up, well it's true but I have these nasty errors.<br />
One more thing when I try to pay my bills via Bitdefender Safepay window I usually end up with a bluescreen.<br />

            I've not used Bitdefender,&nbsp; but apparently Bitdefender , and Safepay in particular, has a reputation
<br />
for causing BSOD.<br />
It may also be the source of the error when downloading from Steam as Safepay also uses the browser.<br />
My inclination would be to dump Bitdefender, but you may find a fix on their forums.<br />
<br />
- Due to nwe problems starting to show it could still be due to malware, so run a full boot time scan<br />
with with&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malwarebytes</a>&nbsp; as a cross reference to Bitdefender (which I assume has not found anything)<br />
<br />
- The error could be one of those misleading errors that Windows sometimes&nbsp; produces.
<br />
Having the inclusion of SPFILEQ.dll&nbsp; with a DX error is the odd part.<br />
The DX part of the error could relate to not having recent audio drivers installed, as the audio drivers<br />
do use DirectX&nbsp; (and Sanctum2 is a recent game). <br />
If you have not updated the audio drivers or the rest of the motherboard/chipset<br />
drivers for you machine you may want to try that.<br />
<br />
- Regarding the Computer management issue. It may be a corrupt shortcut. <br />
You can make a new shortcut as follows -<br />
Go to Windows \ <i>Sytem32</i> and find - <i>compmgmt.msc - </i>( the .msc's are near the bottm, or you can paste this name into the search bar). Make a copy of&nbsp; compmgmt.msc and paste it into the Start menu folder<br />
(deleting or overwriting the original ) -<br />
<br />
If that does not help, there are two more options in the link below.<br />
I'd be inclined to try&nbsp; Amritas suggestions to make a new User profile before doing the registry fix -<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/i-cant-access-computer-management/d38bb260-6088-44e8-ae4f-c164379c7e66">cant-access-computer-management</a><br />
<br />
<br />
- To analyse&nbsp; BSOD you need to upload the memory dump file (Windows \ minidump folder)<br />
&nbsp;to <i>Skydrive</i> and make the file public, so others here can download and analyse the file.
<br />
There are several others on these forums who deal with BSOD issues regularly , so if they don't respond to this post in the next couple of days you may want to start a new post with the BSOD in the title to attract their attention.<br />
Don't forget to include your Skydrive link in the first post, and give details about the other issues<br />
as well.<br />

            I decided to reinstall windows, due to this errors and no solution until now, anyways I did scan the computer with Malware bytes and Bitdefender, both of them reported that everything is OK.<br />
The problem with directx started after I played the game for the first time. When you launch this game for the first time it goes trough a first-time-install-configure etc. and the final step was installing directx, and every time it returned the error regarding
 SPFILEQ.dll. I tried to rename one of the directx files, so I can manually force a reinstall, sadly it returned the same error (even in run-as-administrator) etc.<br />
The drivers were updated, I do this on a monthly basis, so I can assume that a bad shutdown (due to power failure or something else leading to a improper shutdown) caused the SPFILEQ.dll or any links/programs related to this file to become corrupted and windows
 can't recognize the file as being a Windows 7 64-bit file. (The error still seems odd, if you had a Windows 7-32 bit installed and tried to run a 64-bit application you would receive the same error, that's what bother me really)<br />
Right now my computer seems fine, regarding the Bitdefender BSOD I will investigate further if this error will show again.<br />
<br />
I want to thank everyone for suggestions,<br />

<h2>            Spontaneous Theme Change &#40;revisited&#41;</h2>
                    <p>There is a thread with this subject from 2017 that is locked, but not resolved.&nbsp; I have the same problem. Windows 10 is changing my theme spontaneously, particularly the window background color.&nbsp; Nothing else noticeable changes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I believe it happens when I sign in after a screen lock.&nbsp; Don't think it requires a hibernation or full sleep. Just lock then unlock.&nbsp; Very annoying to have to go to personalize and re-select my custom theme every time I sign back in.&nbsp; Any fixes
 for this yet?&nbsp; </p>

            Some themes have different wallpapers &amp; will rotate them, there’s also a choice to change the background colour of taskbar etc to correspond with the wallpaper. Is this what you’re referring to?
<br />If not then can you clarify what is changing &amp; post screenshots of the problems?

<p>For example, when I open a new word doc after a cold start, it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After a lock/unlock sequence, it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The application/window background has changed from my desired beige to the default white. This is true for Excel, and any other application I try.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I go to Personalize-&gt;Themes and select my customized theme that it is supposed to use, all is fine again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wallpaper is static, it does not change.&nbsp; It is a custom picture that I selected. There is no problem with it.</p>

            I don’t have Office so can’t check to see if there’s any theme included with that.
<br />Does this happen within any other programs or just Office?

            Try running sfc:
<br />Right click on the start button&gt;click on powershell/cmd prompt with admin &amp; copy &amp; paste SFC /SCANNOW &amp; press enter.
<br />If all OK move on to:
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup

<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

<br />If it doesn’t fix the problem:

<p>After a screen unlock and the color is wrong, I checked the registry key and it points to AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\July2018b.theme which is the theme I saved and wanted it to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I go to Personalize-&gt;Themes and click on this same theme,
 it changes the color back to what it should be.</p>

<h2>            Stuck on factory reset for 7 hours so far. Still not moved percentage</h2>
                    <p>So basically , my laptop had loads of problems , kept crashing and the blue screen kept happening. it started happening after I installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>so I backed up my files , and I've started a factory reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here I am 8 hours later , and it's still stuck on 'restoring factory settings 16%' and hasn't moved for about 5 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is is this normal , I know it's going to take a long time but this long not moving at all? I'm worried it's crashed whilst doing the restore and it won't ever work 😓</p>

            <p>Hello Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A factory reset is a process, which takes your PC back to the state when you first turned on your Machine.&nbsp;To accomplish this task, OEM will create a reserved Recovery Partition on your PC. Using that partition, reset will take your PC to earlier. Any problem
 with that Recovery Partition might cause this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better assistance, I suggest you to get in touch with device Manufacturer. They are the right person to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your cooperation in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require any assistance.</p>
        </p>
