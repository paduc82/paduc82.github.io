    <title>Win 7 does not fully recognize SSD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win 7 does not fully recognize SSD</h2>
                    I have Win 7 64 bit newly installed on a Mushkin Chronos 120 GB SSD. &nbsp;It works pretty good, but I am concerned that Windows does not fully recognize the SSD. &nbsp;BIOS obviouosly sees it, and it's in Device Mgr, but it's using a disk drive driver from 2006
 (maybe this is OK, &nbsp;but it seems wrong). &nbsp;I turned on AHCI in BIOS, and manually in the registry,. &nbsp;I also had to manually enable TRIM. &nbsp;I have re-run Experience, but Windows still offers defrag for the SSD, which I thought it was not supposed to do. &nbsp;Also,
 that same driver. &nbsp;As I said, it's working pretty good, but I'd like to be sure I'm not missing something? &nbsp;thanks in advance for your help...

            <p>Palcouk is correct that Windows 7 <em>should </em>disable disk defragmenter in Windows 7. I have used 3 separate SSDs (OCZ, Crucial and Kingston)&nbsp;on several different installations of Windows 7&nbsp;and have found that while TRIM was always correctly enabled,
 probably about 2/3 of the time disk defragmentation was still enabled/scheduled.</p>
<p>I now manually disable the disk defragmenter <em>service</em> to help ensure that defrag doesn't happen.</p>
<p>This is a good article:</p>

    <title>How can I replace or repair the Shell Document Object and Control - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeyangel  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I replace or repair the Shell Document Object and Control Library &#40;shdocvw.dll&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently contracted a virus (TrojanBHO) which corrupted two registry keys (shdocvw.dll and actxprxy.dll).
</p>
<p>This disabled all executable file links; I re-registered&nbsp;actxprxy using RegSvr32, but when I attempted to do the same for shdocvw I received an error message: "The module shdocvw.dll was loaded but the DllRegisterServer entry point was not found."</p>
<p>After re-registering the actxprxy&nbsp;key,&nbsp;I have some of the original functionality; I still&nbsp;cannot exercise all&nbsp;folder options (all efforts to have them open in the same window are ignored), however. I realize that this is a minor inconvenience, but I also
 recognize that there may be other consequences I'm not aware of.</p>
<p>I should note that I backed up my registry, but that the backup contains the viral registry key (fsharproj). How can I replace or repair the Shell Document Object and Control Library registry key?</p>
<p>An an important note, my system was re-imaged a year ago due to another virus; I was in grad school at the time, and the support staff upgraded me to Windows 7. The downside of that is that I don't have and can't access a Windows 7 install DVD.</p>
<p>Any assistance or clarification would be greatly appreciated - thank you!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><span>&nbsp; Try<strong> </strong>to<strong> </strong>r<span>un [System File Checker] SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></span></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also try to scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

            <p>Hello, thank you for offering your assistance regarding this matter. </p>
<p>I have already run SFC, but I'm afraid that it didn't rectify the issues ("Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations").
</p>
<p>I have run several very thorough anti-malware procedures and I believe that the majority of that issue has now been addressed (fingers crossed).</p>
<p>What I am primarily concerned with now is rectifying the registry issues (concerning actxprxy.dll, I believe) which are affecting my default saved file locations and my folder behavior (despite re-setting the overall folder options to open in the same window,
 all folders continue to open in new windows).</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to remedy the issue described above ("The module shdocvw.dll was loaded but the DllRegisterServer entry point was not found")?</p>

<p>I know if you delete a file it comes back as part of Windows pertection.</p>

<p>[Window Title]<br />
RegSvr32</p>
<p>[Content]<br />
The module "C:\Windows\system32\shdocvw.dll" was loaded but the entry-point DllRegisterServer was not found.</p>
<p>Make sure that "C:\Windows\system32\shdocvw.dll" is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again.</p>
<p>[OK]</p>

<p>I really want my Zune software working again and I have not been able to get very far on here. I am hoping someone can please help me.</p>

<p>I tried Method one, sfc found one file and fixed it but not the one that is causing the issue. I am running method 2 and I know it will not find anything. I am careful online, and have an excelent paid security suite.</p>

<h2>            Black boxes around word and objects in windows and miscosoft edge</h2>
                    <p>I can't type anything in the start screen, or on Microsoft edge, it just highlights something with a box and refuses to let me click or type elsewhere. On the start bar, if I type something, it just cycles through all my stuff extremely fast whilst still
 having the box on it. I restarted my computer and it's still doing that. I'm not sure if I hit a key or what but this is fairly annoying.

            Hi II.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode shown here:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Re-register the Start Menu from <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-menu-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-men...</a>.  If that works then re-register anything else on the list that needs fixing.
<br />
<br />3) See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  I will walk you through the fixes for Edge to try progressively until it's fixed: 
<br />
<br />Back up your Favorites first in Edge Settings &gt; Import from another Browser &gt; Export to a File.  If it won't open you can reach Favorites to back them up to an HTML file using the tiny app Manage Edge Favorites here:  <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html</a>
<br />
<br />You can reset Edge in Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Feature, scroll down to Microsoft Edge, highlight it, choose Advanced Options, then Repair, or if that fails, Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try re-registering the app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can reinstall it from this link:  <a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-microsoft-edge-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-mic...</a>
<br />
<br />I would have several other browsers available to choose from on the Task Bar since Edge is a work in progress and unreliable.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  You can import Favorites from each other easily in Settings.  
<br />
<br />5) If problems remain go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />6) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I've tried all the above, minus re-installing windows. I tried resetting my pc to a few days before this happened, to no avail. So I don't think re-installing it would do anything. It seems like a simple fix, I just don't know how to get this removed.&nbsp;

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having issues with a specific app giving you trouble when you try to install it on your Xbox One. I recommend you try the steps listed in this helpful support article:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/store/download-game-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot game or app installation problems on Xbox One</a>. Id also recommend pulling the Wireless Display app in the store and at the bottom of its store page press A where it says Wireless Display Support. Give it a try and let us know how it goes!</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all that. I've even tried logging in using a different xbox profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing I do will get the app to install on my Xbox One X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't understand why the app will download just fine on my OG Xbox One but totally fail to download on my Xbox One X even after a full factory reset. It's just baffling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it wasn't for the fact that it's the only app that wont install I would assume my X is faulty. But all other games and apps I try install fine.</p>

<p>Hello Malacath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the only app you are having issues with or is it multiple apps? If it is the only one, there may be a bug or something on your console. Personally I just downloaded this app myself. Are you currently enrolled in the insider program?</p>
<p>

<p>Yes it's just this app.</p>

<p>Hi Malacath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By public dashboard build you are referring to the live update client that all console's receive, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have confirmed that neither of your Xbox's are in the insider program, but your Xbox One X still cannot download the app, then I recommend trying the soft factory reset at least once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Xbox One X at home, so I can test if it download on mine or not. Will have to update that later but based on your troubleshooting it could be a specific issue to the Xbox One X model.</p>

<p>Yes its the public build everyone who is not an insider gets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the factory reset about 3 times now and it still wont download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even tried tethering the xbox to my mobile phone to use 4G instead of my broadband and its still the same.</p>

<p>Hi Malacath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to download the app on an Xbox One S with the public build and I was also just able to download the app on an Xbox One X that is actually enrolled in the Insider program. I'm not entirely sure what is going on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend some basic troubleshooting once more. Unplug your network hardware for about 5 minutes to restart it. Then, go ahead and do a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try installing another app from the Store and once it completes, download the Wireless Display app immediately after. Another thing to try&nbsp;is un-install any app, then re-install another app, and then install the desired app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this helps at all.</p>

</p><p>I've already done all this. Even tried a different router as well as connecting the xbox to mobile phone via tethering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Absolutely nothing I try fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other games and apps download just fine. It's just this one app. It's as though Microsofts servers just don't want my xbox one x to receive the app for some reason. Either that or my console has a unique bug that only effects this one app</p>

</p><p>It has been brought to our attention that Skype's website and services have been blocked by the Internet service providers in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, there is very little that Skype can do about the said situation.&nbsp;Best move would be to contact your local provider and ask why they are blocking Skype. You can find additional details on this FAQ.

<h2>            Lost money from GTA Online. Rockstar support refusing to help me.</h2>
                    
<p>I had around $700,000 before they wipped&nbsp;all of the modded money people had. What I had was&nbsp; from the stimulus money that I had left over that Rockstar gave us after the launch for online was messed up and money that I earned from jobs or missions. I now
 have $230,740.&nbsp; I did not have any modded money in my account.I have posted two tickets on their forums and all I get is an automated response saying I had modded money in my account. I cannot reach a real person and feel im being ignored.&nbsp;Their number has
 been disconnected. Can anyone from Microsoft help me?</p>

<p>This would be a game specific issue that only Rockstar can resolve. &nbsp;The modded money is flagged by the developers so if they are saying some $450k was modded then it most likely was. &nbsp;That's not to say that you modded the game at all, just that the money
 itself was not legit.</p>

<p>The thing is that it was not modded because I never played on a public free roam. I only played in private with friends and no one gave me money. I know Microsoft cannot really fix it but I wish someone could contact them and get them to help me since they
 seem to not care and I keep getting automated messages.</p>

            <p>Since it works on all 32-bit computers, it's most likely incompatible with 64-bit Windows 7.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This site just lists the compatible OSes, not the versions (32 or 64 bit)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best would be to check on another 64-bit OS and confirm. Contact the manufacturer for further support.

            Hi Lily
<br />
<br />The file nvspcap64.dll corresponds to NVIDIA driver that is installed on your PC. You can see this error, when there is some corruption with that particular driver file. Suggest you try with the below mentioned steps and check if it helps you.
<br />
<br />Method 1:
<br />
<br />Try updating the Graphics card drivers from device manager and check if it helps:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />a) Open run command by pressing Windows key + R and type “devmgmt.msc” (without quotes) and hit Enter.
<br />
<br />b) Spot and expand the “Display adapters”. 
<br />
<br />c). Right click on the Graphics card driver and select “Update Driver Software”. When it prompts to choose an option How do you want to search driver, then go with Search automatically for updated driver software. If you have a driver available on your PC, then select Browse my computer for driver software, then select the appropriate location, where the driver located on your PC for updating it. (Ensure that PC is connected to Internet while performing this step)
<br />
<br />d). Once this is done, restart the computer to check the problem fixed. If it doesn't fix the issue, then Right click on the same driver and select “Uninstall” then restart the system and let the system install the driver automatically on Start. Check and see if it resolve the issue. (Recommended step)
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Method 2:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Check and install latest Windows 10 graphics card drivers for your device from Manufacture's website and check if it helps. Most probably it will fix the issue
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If no updated drivers available on the manufacturer’s website for windows 10, then trying installing drivers in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />a. Uninstall the existing graphics card drivers completely from your PC through control panel and reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />b. Download the latest and available driver from the manufacturer’s website.
<br />
<br />c. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘Properties’.
<br />
<br />d. Click on the ‘Compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 8/8.1 or 7 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.
<br />
<br />Keep us posted if you require further assistance.

            Hi Lily.
<br />
<br />That error is generated by your Nvidia graphics card software that came with the Nvidia device driver . . .
<br />
<br />You should download the newest version, then uninstall the old version and install that new version to get rid of that error popup when your system starts . . .

<h2>            Sound issues with Netflix after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem with my audio after upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; Unlike some of the others on here, mine only occurs with Netflix streaming.</p>
<p>There's a&nbsp;'crackling' sound when there's music or dialog, like there's a wire loose and it's making an intermittent connection.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen with DVD's, YouTube or any other video; only Netflix (and my other devices don't have this problem on Netflix).</p>
<p>I've run the diagnostics program (didn't find anything), and I've tried updating and reinstalling the audio drivers, using different browsers, (MS Edge, Firefox, Chrome, and the Netflix App) but none of these have corrected the problem.&nbsp; I think it may have
 been one of the recent updates, since this only started a couple of weeks ago, but which one?</p>

After the most recent&nbsp;Windows 10 update,&nbsp; I had video but no sound in Netflix and had sound for everything else such as&nbsp;YouTube etc. &nbsp; Called Microsoft support and after a lengthy amount of time, they could not help.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally found a solution&nbsp;:&nbsp; Go to the&nbsp;Control&nbsp;Panel,&nbsp;
 then Sound.&nbsp; My default format was set to DVD quality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set it to the max setting - Studio Quality.&nbsp; &nbsp;You should get your sound back for&nbsp;Netflix.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp;

</p><p>The download portion went fine.&nbsp; Then it enters media creation portion.&nbsp; In resource monitor, I can see the disk activity.&nbsp; The last major activity is writing C:\$Windows.~WS\Sources\Windows\sources\install.esd.&nbsp; Once that's over, there is some minor activity
 at C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore\Logs\edb.log.&nbsp; A few min later, the disk activity goes to zero with no process reading or writing at all.&nbsp; At that point, the system is frozen.&nbsp; The only way to recover is power cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could go wrong here and how could I fix it?</p>

<h3> pwcsquared  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are the edges of my video getting cut off when I render with movie maker&#63;</h2>
                    When I playback the preview of the video in movie maker everything looks fine, but when I render it the top, bottom, and sides all get cut off by a few pixels, and there is a black box around the whole thing. (This is NOT an aspect ratio problem.) I recorded
 the video in 960x540, but I've tried rendering in a lot of different sizes (same aspect ratio though) and the same thing always happens.

            I was having the same issues as above, but you misunderstood something, in the video preview, it's fine, it's only after the video is 'saved' or rendered that it cuts out pixels from the top, bottom and sides. For example, &nbsp;I will edit my video that was
 recorded in 1920x1080 pixel resolution, and edit it in the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio of windows movie maker. The preview and everything during the editing process is fine, but once I render and save the video, I lose a little bit of my video footage from
 tops bottom and sides. I'm not talking about the black bars, I'm seeing an actual absence of the picture throughout my entire video, and it is also for the whole duration of the video. Any help?

            <p>Hello Makka899,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across your post while trying to solve my own issue. &nbsp;My video was being cut on the sides and there was no issue with the aspect ratio. &nbsp;I realized that only one clip had its sides cut off. &nbsp;When you hover over your specific clips, it displays the
 editing you did. &nbsp;The clip which had its sides cut had the &nbsp;video stabilization function selected. &nbsp;I guess Microsoft makes up for a shaky video by cutting off a significant portion of the image. &nbsp;I turned it off by selecting "None" and it solved my issue.
 &nbsp;Hope this solution helps anyone who has this issue in the future.</p>

            Thank you for trying to answer my questions.&nbsp; However, my first questions on why my email is "frozen" produced a reasonable solution which I tried: At the time of my initial problem I had windows live mail 2011. I was asked to export my contacts and email
 messages that I wanted to save, which I did.&nbsp; Then I was to "repair" windows, which I did but it didn't solve the problem.&nbsp; Then I was to uninstall windows 2011 and install it again, which I did. But, I now have windows 2012 and it imported my files that I
 previously exported, and I got the same problem!!&nbsp; Now with the .dat attachment, I can't open it and I don't know what to do to correct the problem--if the .dat file has the answer, I need to know how to open it.&nbsp; If the .dat file isn't the answer, then I'm
 back to square one!&nbsp; The one software program I tried was detected as a virus and destroyed. I don't understand why these emails come back as "permanent errors". I can't delete them or edit them--help!!!<br />

            <p>DAT files attached to emails are almost always superfluous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several versions of Microsoft Office ago, there was an issue that caused some email to have a winmail.dat attachment.&nbsp; This was caused because that version of Outlook and/or Microsoft Exchange Server sent "Rich Text formatted" messages using a proprietary
 format that no other email client could understand.&nbsp; See, e.g., <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/278061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/278061</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-winmaildat-attachment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-winmaildat-attachment</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think a file named ATT000nn.DAT is the same thing, but it may be some sort of similar formatting information.&nbsp; If you can read the rest of the message, I would just ignore this attachment (I do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're really curious, when you right-click on the file, select Notepad as the program to use to open it and see if there is anything intelligible there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from the DAT file attachment issue, what is "the same problem" that you're now experiencing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no programs named "windows 2011" and "windows 2012."&nbsp; What version of Windows do you have and what program/application are you using to send and receive email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you click Start and then right-click on "Computer" or "My Computer" and select "Properties," you'll get a screen that tells you what version of Windows you have and whether you have installed a service pack.&nbsp; Ignore the copyright and "version" dates.</p>

<p>Hi Delta Lider,</p>
<p>Thats not a good one.</p>
<p>First of all i would check that you are forwarding the ports as you should.</p>
<p>If you are using RT-N66U i would check that UPNP on the router is active.</p>
<p>If it is, i might try and put the xbox one in the DMZ zone. </p>
<p>If it still dosen't work and your NAT is filtered. You need to have a chat with your ISP.</p>
<p>Since they seem to be filtering ports, due to some NAT translation that is poorly set up.</p>
<p>Let me know if that works for you,</p>
<p>Br,</p>

    <title>Does enabling WPA and WPA2 on the same wireless network affect the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmy_nguyen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does enabling WPA and WPA2 on the same wireless network affect the broadband speed of the device connected to the network&#63;</h2>
                    For context, at the time I was using a router that can enable both WPA and WPA2. Why would I do this? I had some devices that could only connect to a wireless network through WPA, that is no longer the case and I no longer use those devices anymore. This
 post was created years ago.

                    <p>Where are the system Emoji's stored? I really want to replace them with different Emoji's. Please tell me if they are image&nbsp;or font and tell me the file directory. I also need the names of the files. Also how hacky would it be to replace them? My OS is Windows
 10 pro and my computer is a Surface Pro. Windows 10 pro came pre-installed with my computer. It has 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage space (internal), and the app I am using is LITERALLY&nbsp;EVERYTHING! And I DON'T WANT YOUR COPY AND PASTED ANSWERS SO DON'T TELL ME

                    <p>Hi, I have noticed a setting for "kid's account" on the page for "manage parental permissions" for my new outlook.com email account.&nbsp; I cannot see any option to "Add" a Kids account to this.</p>
<p>How do you add a Kid's account?</p>
<p>What is this options for?&nbsp; (I assume to have a level of control over your childs email account?)</p>

            Hi,<br />
if this can help, I have the same problem. The Kids Account page always says "no accounts", even if in my Family Safety settings I do have one kid account, managed by my main one.<br />
Is there a clear, exhaustive documentation anywhere on how this feature is supposed to be used?<br />

            If this worked, my kids' school would use SkyDrive for all children to store their class projects.&nbsp; The thing holding them back is that they don't want to force parents to give their children email accounts that can send/receive mail from anybody.<br />

            <p>Hi Luca,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the screenshots that you have provided, you are accessing the kids account page via
<a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>&nbsp;website. A kid will only appear there if you have a child that is registered under COPPA and is a Kid account type. When registering under COPPA, it will automatically link to
 the Parent because it will ask for the Parent credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing a child via Family Safety is&nbsp;somehow different. Since you said that you have one child account in the Family Safety settings, you&nbsp;can manage the&nbsp;child account using the
<a href="https://familysafety.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Family Safety website</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span>The feature to&nbsp;manage the emails that is&nbsp;sent or receive on children email accounts has been&nbsp;removed for users that did not previously set it up. If you had content management turned on before, you will still see the feature on the

<p>Hi Luca,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the screenshots that you have provided, you are accessing the kids account page via
<a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>&nbsp;website. [...]<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
Sorry, but this is not correct. If the screenshots show that I was using the live.com pages it is because I had been redirected there. As shown in the first page, I am inside my outlook.com account, on the mail/inbox page, from there I click the Account Settings
 option and that's when it redirects me.<br />
To me, this looks like something messed up in the way the account is used and shared among services. My kid account - which shows OK in the Family safety pages - is linked to my outlook.com account so there is no reason why it shouldn't show up when I access
 my account settings. I don't know if this is a bug or a design flaw, but certainly I would say it does not make fully sense the way it works now. I hope you agree on this.<br />
<br />
What I would expect is the following:<br />
- refer everything to my single account @outlook.com<br />
- manage all my account settings in a single place. Or at least have the same settings in different services (family safety, mail, ...)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
