Hello Juan Stevens,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try this: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uninstall your Mail app. This also uninstalls the People, Calendar and Messaging apps, they are bundled together.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Sign out of your Surface, tell it to shut down through the power icon (lower right hand corner in the login screen).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Restart the Surface, go to Store and reinstall the Mail app (which reinstalls the other apps too).
<strong>DO NOT</strong> go into the Mail app once it reinstalls. Go into the People app, your Microsoft account may automatically connect, if not, add it. Once you see your contacts populating into People, go ahead and go into the Mail app, you should be all
 set. </p>

            sorry Microsoft none of this worked for me but i did find the link below very helpful and most importantly provided the desired end result..... which was to be able to receive my Outlook emails on my Surface - however to the peeps at Microsoft it took
 a whole day of trying to get there which is pretty unreasonable considering the time poor reality that is the modern world - and where receiving emails is a daily bodily function - I'd rather have easy email set up than a bing travel app any day... &nbsp;

            I tried refreshing my surface also. That didn't work. In the end, it just fixed itself a few hours later that day. It just started syncing ok.

<h2>            L drive accidentally disconnected whilst updating from W8 to W8.1</h2>
                    <p>I updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 via the Windows Store. After the W8.1 had been installed, I was given the option to choose setting&gt; use express settings&gt;customize&gt;learn more about express settings. Somewhere in this, I obviously made a wrong selection
 and found that an L drive which had been created to contain Livedrive Briefcase,&nbsp; when I had earlier sought to have the cloud storage of my files updated automatically as I made changes, had been disconnected (in Internet Explorer/This PC/Network Locations).
 I've tried everything I can think of and also contacted one of the Microsoft Support workers, who insisted it was a Livedrive problem. I think he was wrong. My Livedrive files are still available if I sign in directly through the Portal, but the disconnection
 problem happened only as a result of my upgrading from W8 to W8.1. I can find no means of reconnecting the L drive. Can anyone help? I should add I am not particularly technically accomplished.</p>

<p>Thanks, Andre,</p>
<p>This is not OneDrive. I have never used OneDrive nor its predecessor, Sky Drive. My Cloud app is from Knowhow Cloud (Livedrive). I have a Microsoft Account - in fact, I have two - Hotmail and Outlook. Before I converted from W8 to W8.1, anything to/from
 my Hotmail address was directed to Outlook; now I see that I have both, at least at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The L: drive, with Briefcase in it, appeared in File Explorer in Windows 8 after I made changes that meant I did not have to access Knowhow Cloud via their Web Portal to view my uploaded files. Now, in Windows 8.1/Desktop/This PC under Network Locations,&nbsp;
 this caption appears: Disconnected Network Drive (L:), with NTFS in the next line of the caption.</p>

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to my previous, I have found this discussion on </p>
<p>https://www.eldos.com/forum/read.php?FID=13&amp;TID=4823</p>
<p>It describes the same problem as I had. The important bit seems to be this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Turns out this wasn't an issue with CbFs at all so putting the info here in case anyone else hits this problem.
<br />
<br />
During the update from Windows 8 to 8.1, a registry key gets replaced which stops the network redirector from being loaded. The fix (other than reinstalling the dll) is to update:
<br />
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order and edit ProviderOrder to include the correct version of cbfs at the front.
<br />
Eg. Change it from: <br />
RDPNP,LanmanWorkstation,webclient <br />
to: <br />
CbFs3,RDPNP,LanmanWorkstation,webclient, End of quote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to follow this through (my CbFs version is CbFs3), but inputting the full info starting HKLM as above into Search in Windows8_OS (C:) turns up nothing. Is this any help in finding a solution?</p>

<h2>            6GB of RAM, Windows 7 64-bit says only 3GB is usable</h2>
                    
<p>Hi folks, <br />
<br />
Today I replaced my old GeForce 8500GT <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/279157-30-windows-usable#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>graphics</span><span>card</span></span></a>with
<span><span>graphics</span><span>card</span></span></a>with
 a brand new HD5770. After installing the new card though I have a problem -<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/279157-30-windows-usable#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>windows</span></span></a>now
 is only letting me use 3GB of my 6GB of RAM! <br />
<br />
It's coming up in the Resource Monitor as 'Hardware Reserved' which I assume is for the HD5770, but why would it need 3GB of RAM on top of its 1GB already?<br />
<br />
When I start the <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/279157-30-windows-usable#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>system</span></span></a>it
<span><span>system</span></span></a>it
 is only showing 3GB, though the 'Windows Experience Index' states that there is 6GB of RAM (3GB usable), and as said, the Resource Monitor lists 3GB of RAM as hardware reserved.<br />
<br />
How do I change this and get back to using the full 6GB? <br />
<br />
My system specs are: <br />
- Windows 7 64-bit (yes, it's definately 64-bit) <br />
- 6GB DDR2 800 RAM <br />
- HD5770 Graphics <br />
- Gigabyte M61-PM-S2 <br />
<br />
I did look at the Bios, but can't find anything about shared memory etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition I flashed my Bios which seemed to achieve absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Palcouk - yeah it is quite touchy. Often I'll need to re-seat the RAM numerous times before it will work properly. It's definately compatible with the motherboard, I checked that up before buying it. All four sticks are Kingston DDR2 800 valueRAM, the two
 1GB sticks are N5, the two 2GB sticks are N6. In Bios I have them all set to N6 as recommended by Kingston support. I haven't changed any Bios memory timings or tried to overclock. I simply don't know enough about those things to even attempt them.</p>
<p>With the RAM memtest, how do I use that? Am I supposed to burn it to a disc and then run it at startup or something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andre - unfortunately that option doesn't seem to exist in my Bios. Where exactly would it be listed?</p>

            As it turns out, it seems that I have a faulty RAM module. The computer doesn't like just that chip being in, plus when it's added, the comp says 3GB usable of 6GB. However when I remove it (it's a 2GB chip), then the comp reports the correct 4GB.

<p>Palcouk - yeah it is quite touchy. Often I'll need to re-seat the RAM numerous times before it will work properly. It's definately compatible with the motherboard, I checked that up before buying it. All four sticks are Kingston DDR2 800 valueRAM, the two
 1GB sticks are N5, the two 2GB sticks are N6. In Bios I have them all set to N6 as recommended by Kingston support. I haven't changed any Bios memory timings or tried to overclock. I simply don't know enough about those things to even attempt them.</p>
<p>With the RAM memtest, how do I use that? Am I supposed to burn it to a disc and then run it at startup or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andre - unfortunately that option doesn't seem to exist in my Bios. Where exactly would it be listed?</p>

<h2>            ADVAPI32.dll not found, applications won&#39;t start</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I found this problem this morning, after i log in to my vista ultimate 64 bit.. it keeps saying "ADVAPI32.dll not found, reinstalling application bla bla bla" i wonder, what causes this? i look at the windows/system32 folder, there is the advapi32.dll file,
 but when i tried to regsvr23 advapi32.dll it doest want, it says something about entry-point. how can i fix this? the other question is, i just suspect the advapi32.dll is corrupted, how can i replace the file with the "clean" files? since i cant do anything
 about that... all the permissions was set "read only" and I CANNOT CHANGE THAT? any ideas?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
Rendy

    <title>Unable to connect to internet after AVAST tech support took remote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patmhb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to connect to internet after AVAST tech support took remote access of the computer. Error &#34;Not connected. No connections are available&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: availableCannot connect&nbsp; my laptop to the internet after remote assistance "cleaned" it</p>
<p>I am, admittedly, a computer illiterate &amp; tend to speak/understand the King's English rather than "computer-ese", so please bear with me if I get the terminology incorrect &amp;/or provide unnecessary/irrelevant information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary of my issue: My laptop was connected to the internet (auto-connect to AT&amp;T wireless router) until remote assistance (via AVAST Quick Connect icon)) cleaned it &amp; now it is not [connected]! Simple fix yes? Well maybe. Here's what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I click the Internet Explorer icon.</li><li>A window opens that says "Not connected. No connections are available." This makes no sense to me because I am using a 2nd computer, in the same room which obviously is connected to IE &nbsp;</li><li>By the way, a similar message appears when click on Firefox &amp; Google Chrome. </li><li>I click Troubleshoot &amp; that green bar thingy starts going &amp; going . . .</li><li>Finally there is a message saying "Windows cannot automatically detect the network's proxy settings. Explore additional options."
</li><li>I have spent hours &amp; hours + more hours &amp; hours "option exploring" - I have read so &nbsp;many "how tos" &amp; "what ises" that I think I am permanently cross-eyed! Although most instructions were waaay above my pay-grade, the ones I tried did not solve my problem;
 either they were not after all applicable to my situation or some small but crucial step was inadvertently omitted (similar to an experienced cook giving a recipe to a non-cook but failing to mention "stir constantly to prevent contents from boiling over').</li></ol>
<p>Anyway, nothing has worked, so here I am, continuing with &nbsp;my "explorations." The following is a partial list of what I have done/tried to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shut down &amp; re-started my computer several times;</li><li>Unplugged a yellow wire from the router &amp; plugged directly into my computer. And yes, when that failed, I plugged the wire back into the router;</li><li>System recovery prior to remote assist clean-up, several times using differing dates or access points or whatevers;
</li><li>Called AVAST Tech support. They said they could fix problem for another $139.00 (already paid $179.00 for assistance plan. Previously had no trouble).</li></ul>
<p>FYI: My laptop is a Gateway NV53 running Windows 7 Home Premium. Oh &amp; don't know what this means but I am the Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please pretty please help me? Remember, you'd need to include every teeny tiny step &amp; in layman's terms. I would be ever so grateful &amp; you would have the satisfaction of knowing you had just done a good deed in an otherwise dirty world yes? &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Backup completes but the Last backup date is not updated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> systemoftheworld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup completes but the Last backup date is not updated</h2>
                    <p>I've been using the Windows 7 backup.&nbsp; It completes with no error messages showing in the event log and the backup has all the expected files available for restore.&nbsp; However the Backup and Restore centre has the message "Check your backup results - The backup
 completed but some files were skipped" Looking at the details I see only one message "Backup skipped backing up
\\DRACO\Crafts as it is not on local machine.", but no error code.&nbsp; Backup is designed to skip folders in libraries that reside on network drives so presumably this is just for information only, however the last backup date
 and time are not updated.&nbsp; In this case Backup and Restore is quite misleading, since the backup ran exactly as it is meant to - ignoring the drive not on the local machine - but reports the results inconsistently.&nbsp; Given having network shares is a feature
 of libraries you would have thought the backup utility supplied with Windows 7 could report the outcome of the backup consistently, and not allow information only messages to be reported in such a way as to mislead the user into thinking the backup did not
 take place.&nbsp; Does anyone have a solution to this or do we just wait for the defect to be&nbsp;fixed?</p>

</p><p>==============================================================</p>
<p>I've been experiencing this kind of intermittent BSODs for weeks, and there doesn't seem to be a particular operation which is likely to be the cause. Puzzled with it and asking for help. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>Note: Windows 10 can be started normally and it functions well most of the time. The BSODs just occurred randomly during use.</p>

            <p>Hi Zenas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the following for us to assist you further:</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions exist: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Default value in the [Boot Loader] section of the Boot.ini file is missing or invalid.</li><li>Windows NT is not installed in the location specified in the Boot.ini file.</li><li>For Microsoft Windows 2000, the Hal.dll file can be corrupted or missing.</li></ul>
<p><span>NOTE</span>: This issue can also occur in Windows NT 4.0 and 3.5 if the system partition is larger than 7.8 gigabytes and system boot files have be placed outside of the 7.8 GB limit (possibly as a result of applying a service pack
 or defragmenting the drive). Windows XP does not have this limitation. This is a hardware limitation and occurs independently of the operating system. This should not be an issue on newer computer if their BIOS supports INT13 Extensions and this feature is
 turned on, which it is by default. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the link below to troubleshoot with the issue:</p>

</p><p>Nope, the theme patch is not the reason. The problem still exists even after I reinstalled the system with only necessary drivers on it.</p>

<p>I have an ASUS laptop with Windows 10 on it too. Since I uninstalled the GameFirst driver which has something to do with network management, I haven't experienced a single BSOD yet.</p>
<p>Hope this will be helpful :)</p>

            <p>I had this BSOD daily for quite a while. &nbsp;Was having it with Win 7 as well as after I changed to Win 10. &nbsp;I did all the usual stuff - reseated all hardware using rubbing alcohol to clean contact, &nbsp;made sure all the drivers were up to date, etc. &nbsp;Ran mem86
 test numerous times overnight with no errors detected. &nbsp;Did my C drive test (have a 500 GB SSD), which reported no errors. &nbsp;Ran Samsung diagnostics on the SSD, with no errors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspected based on commit charge increasing (monitored using taskmgr) that there was a problem between the 8 GB RAM installed and the paging file usage. &nbsp;If you track memory usage you can see it increases over time, eventually using the paging file. &nbsp;When
 I loaded lots of apps like Picassa and Chrome (neither of which seem to handle memory very well and slowly increase memory consumption), BSOD happened sooner rather than later. &nbsp;SO I decided to purchase an additional 8 GB of RAM and when it arrived I installed
 the new memory in place of the old memory and moved the old memory to the empty slots. &nbsp;Since then (now about 10 days) no BSOD and the system is stable even when I overload it with apps and commit charge grows beyond 8 GB. &nbsp; Posting this in hopes someone else
 can solve their BSOD problem. &nbsp; BTW, diagnostics for BSOD continue to be hopelessly inadequate and ultimately you have to just keep trying things until problem is solved. &nbsp; Had persistent BSOD about 10 years ago with Windows 2000 system and in that case also
 RAM was the issue, RAM just went occasionally bad, was fixed with new RAM. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Saved external .AVI file in moved Xbox app GameDVR folder - All files missing &#47; gone</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to record my screen today - and read that you can use the Windows10 Xbox App GameDVR feature to screen cap. I moved the default saving folder to my external hard drive - There was "Capture" folder with "desktop.ini" in it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I didn't like the way it was recording so went back to Camtasia to record my screen. After recording I went to "save as..." section under the Camtasia software and saved it inside the "capture" folder that I created to hold the GameDVR captures......<br />
<br />
After saving the file - I went to view it in file explorer and nothing exists and no files are deleted. The files show up under "Recent Files" they just don't show up anywhere else and cannot be accessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the files just gone / non existent? Or is there a chance they are somewhere, hidden or recoverable?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Fallout 4 Loading Stuck at 94&#37;</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone encountered long loading times or it going to 94% and seeming to stop?</p>
<p>I inserted the disc in Xbox One console and it chugged along just fine until it reached 94% and it's been there for about an hour and a half now...</p>
<p>Can't tell if it's doing anything and reluctant to stop it and mess something up to start over...</p>

<p>Are you talking about trying to RUN THE GAME or INSTALL THE GAME to the hard drive? &nbsp;Either way you might change the INSTANT ON to ENERGY SAVING, restart the console and then change it back once your problem is fixed. &nbsp;This is done in SETTINGS for the DASHBOARD.
 &nbsp;Additional advice will require whether you're trying to RUN or INSTALL the game. &nbsp;These are 2 completely separate things.</p>

            yes, multiple times. It didn't help. What seems to be partially working is going only with 5ghz and getting rid of 2.4 ghz. It is still 60% of&nbsp; my other pc (and very variable) but at least somewhat usable.

<p>I am having a similar experience - using speedtest.net I get a download speed of over 300Mbit on my cellphone (connected to the wifi), and the Surface laptop going at maximum 160Mbit on the same wifi, same distance to the router. Other devices also run at
 over 300Mbit.&nbsp;<br />
Performance was even slower until I changed the driver setting for WMM-PS to high performance.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4af3ef5d-459a-400b-b327-a2e33ec5faf4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4af3ef5d-459a-400b-b327-a2e33ec5faf4?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p>Apparently, if you have an older video card, that might be reason why iTunes setup is failing. Try the following download to see if it works:

If that does not work, try the latest executable: <br />

            Were you running latest iTunes edition? Because a update just went out a few days ago which I suspect addressed issues with Creator update as well as other stuff. Probably best to uninstall iTunes and reinstall making sure you select as administrator to
 be sure it installs correctly.&nbsp;

<h2>            Activation code already used on other PCs and Windows Update keeps failing.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I bought a new Computer and when I try to activate my windows 10 pro code, the first time it said it wasn't meant for this PC, the second time it said that the product key was already used on another device.<br />
<br />
Another thing is that I keep trying to install an update called " Windows 10 version 1709 for x64 based system (KB4088776).<br />
<br />
What am I supposed to do now?

            Hi Zoeey.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Normally when you buy a PC with WIndows 10 preinstalled it already has the Product Key embedded in the UEFI Firmware chip on the motherboard and activates itself from that.  How is it that you purchase of a new PC has a separate Product Key.  Did you buy Windows separately and install it yourself?  
<br />
<br />Have you tried contacting the seller to find out why the Product Key isn't working?  It's illegal to sell preinstalled Windows that isn't able to be activated, or to resell Windows at all without a working Product Key.  
<br />
<br />As to Fall Creators Update Version 1709, 
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by downloading and  installing Media Creation Tool from this link and then choose to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If Version 1709 causes problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist you can also roll it back within 10 days at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery and block it using the Hide Updates tool or another method here to wait to see if it matures:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to Clean Install doing a great install like the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            I understand.  Then while you wait to hear from them I'd try again but this time triple-check accuracy because I've almost always found that to be the problem with such a long Key and the inability to copy and paste in this case.  
<br />
<br />The error that's it's being used on other PC's is concerning because we have reports lately that shops are installing Volume License Keys mean only for business and large organizations and which require regular reactivation.  But if this is an Amazon seller they surely must realize that this would get them banned if not prosecuted.  So I would contact Amazon if you don't hear from them soon to help you get a response.  Keep us posted as you go because Microsoft also pursues piracy.

            So I just contacted Amazon and they say the fault lies with ASUS while They didn't sell me the computer. So I told them&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">SNOGARD Computer
 GmbH sold me the Computer and then they said that I have to contact Snogard and or Asus since the code came from them and not from Amazon.</span>

            <p>Hello Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;would try to work it out together with you in the most simplest of the ways to identify the issue. If everything goes well, reset wont be required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check if the option for <span>
Taskbar Notification Area System Icons are enabled. To do so, follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Settings Charm with the shortcut Windows Key<a href="http://solverbase.com/w/File:Windows_Key.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Key"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsolverbase.com%2fimages%2f7%2f71%2fWindows_Key.png" height="17" width="24" /></span></a>+
 I, and click on the <strong>System</strong> icon.</li><li>Click/tap on <strong>Notifications &amp; actions</strong> on the left side, and click/tap on the
<strong>Turn system icons on or off</strong> link on the right side.</li><li>Set the toggle to <strong>on </strong>for Action Center.</li><li>When finished, you can close the window.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If it still does not help,&nbsp;we would want&nbsp;to assess whether the issue is related to functionality in Windows.</p>
<p>Kindly provide us a screenshot of the exact situation. The detail might help us to identify the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to post a screenshot in your query.</p>
<p>Ref: <span><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4</span></a></span></span></p>

4. You may also try reinstalling the wireless drivers and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp; Double hit Network Adapter option and look for your wireless modem you are running.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp; Make a Right hit on your modem name and tap Uninstall. <br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Click Ok button to confirm the uninstall process.<br />

<h2>            Lego Pirates freezing.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm so glad i'm completing this and trading it in today, the amount of times i've been near the end of a level now and the games froze is unreal. It only seems to have done it whilst playing freeplay though tbh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this hadn't have been pirates and an easy 1000G i doubt i'd have bothered.</p>

<p>Not had it freeze yet but twice on Dead Mans Chest i had one of the characters glitch and get stuck on stupid things like ladders, and my other half couldn't use the compass last night and had to start over.
</p>
<p>Btw did you have it installed to the HDD? i had the same problem with Lego HP but when i deleted the install and played from the disc it stopped freezing.</p>

<p>Freezes on my kids quite a bit too. However as for no replay value, I have to disagree, depending on your age of course. My kids play the heck out of it in and out of levels just being pirates. Great for kids imo and simple fun for anyone else for a while
 too.</p>

<p>it kept freezing for me once you got to freeplay mode and went into the areas you couldn't get into before. the amount of times i had to restart a level after getting 6 mini kits was annoying and made me angry. but like everyone said its a lego game, expect
 it. lego harry potter glitched on the last gold brick so i had to start over to 1000 it.</p>

<p>Hey so I just bought a 12 month xbox live gold code and I've tried to redeem it on xbox.com, it's not invalid because when i enter it it tells me that its for 12 months, but when i hit confirm after that it just says Something went wrong. Sorry about that
 give it a try in a while and it's been almost 2 hours since then. If you have any help for me please reply to me because I don't want all that money to go to waste. Also do these cards expire after a period of time?</p>
