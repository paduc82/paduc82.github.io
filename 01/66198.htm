<h2>            Not enough disk space for Windows 10 Anniversary update.</h2>
                    <p>I have tried and tried and tried to get the anniversary update of windows 10 to download on my brother's Dell laptop and no matter what I try it will not download...not enough disk space...I have even added a 30 gb flash drive and it will not even read that
 it is there.</p>
<p>I have read all the things to try and have tried most of them but it will not let me do it.&nbsp; It is only a small hard drive.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me, I am just a regular computer user, and I don't want to mess anything up.</p>
<p>If I try recovery, will it put windows 10 back in or the anniversary one?</p>
<p>

            <p>I tried to follow the directions, but the laptop does not do the things that the directions call for.</p>
<p>I even called Dell to have them help and they could not do it either, they said to get Microsoft to help me.</p>
<p>I was on the phone for an hour with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The setup window does not give me an option to use a flash drive or any other kind for that matter, so I am still stuck with the option of not enough space.</p>
<p>Can't figure out how to delete the previous Windows installation files, can't find them.</p>
<p>So if anyone out there can help ...PLEASE</p>

            Yes, I did. &nbsp;I downloaded to a flash drive and then took as much stuff out of the laptop as I could to get enough disk space and then used the flash drive to do a clean install. &nbsp;Lets just say, it took alot of messing around until I got it.

<b><span>Hi,</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span>I suggest you to follow the below methods.</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 1: <br />
</span></b><span>I would suggest you to first check if the services associated with system restore are working.<br />
Check for the service<b> Volume Shadow Copy </b>if it is running or not. To check for the services –</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Go to Start - Run and type <b>Services.msc</b> then press enter.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Under the Status column look for any entries that read as "Started".</span>
</li><li>
<span>And check if the service is set to automatic or manual.</span> </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Note: If the service is stopped, all the Restore points will be deleted.</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 2: <br />
</span></b><span>You may boot in safe mode and then try to perform a system restore. This will help check if any non-Microsoft service is interfering with the system restore.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In Safe mode; you have access to only basic files and drivers. Refer to the link to start the computer in safe mode and then check -<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>Now check in safe mode if you are able to perform the system restore- you may refer to the System Restore support articles for guidance-</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore</a></span></p>

<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 3: Disable Antivirus program and check</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Note: enable the antivirus program once you are done with the system restore.</span></p>

    <title>Plug and Play almost burning my house down. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> war of tigers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Plug and Play almost burning my house down.</h2>
                    
<p>So after a year of owning a new plug and play charger for the xbox 360 controller it nearly burned my home down. It had started smoking and now has a pencil sized hole in the bottom of it and it reaks like burnt plastic. And I believe it killed my power
 brick. I just call customer service and there is nothing that can be done. This was by one Mr. Dwayne, a very nice man but of no help. Be fore I bought this 360 my neighbor's house had burned down and i was lucky enough to only have some singed grass so I
 do not take this lightly at all. I hope you never have to deal with such a problem.</p>
<p>So as it goes I purchased a new power brick matching the same voltage for my original &nbsp;Xbox elite and it powers on. But that was at my cost after dealing with the red ring problem and then buying this one and having little to no issues till now. Why wont
 xbox at least offer to repair or inspect this for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this had been the start of a fire i would be sending Microsoft a bill. So why now after being a loyal customer and spending thousands of dollars why is nothing being done, aisde form being charged $119 to send it in for repairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft will be lucky after this if I decided to buy any of there non soft ware products again.</p>

<p>to microsoft xbox employees you know how to contact me if you deiced to handle my grievance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you have a wonderful day.</p>

            <p>Error Code 5 often means that there is significant file system damage - start by running CHKDSK and SFC to repair thisngs....</p>
<p>Click on the Start button<br />
type in the Search box<br />
CMD.EXE<br />
right-click on the only file that is found <br />
Select Run as Administrator<br />
- the Elevated Command Prompt window should pop up<br />
At the Command prompt, type<br />
CHKDSK C: /R<br />
and hit the Enter key<br />
You will be told that the drive is locked, and the CHKDSK will run at he next boot - hit the Y key, and then reboot. The chkdsk will take a few hours depending on the size of the drive, so be patient!<br />
<br />
After the CHKDSK has run, Windows should boot normally (possibly after a second auto-reboot) - then run the SFC<br />
<br />

<h2>            Game DVR recorded clips skip &#40;playing BF4&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I don't get it. I record clips using both the Game DVR app and using "xbox record that" feature and yet on most occasions, the clip I try to record skips over some of the best content. It's like someone just cut a random 5 seconds out and never shows the
 main part of the recording that I wanted in the first place. This happens on both the clip unsaved and saved.</p>
<p>I've reset my console numerous times after having audio issues and now this, but still nothing seems to fix it. Anyone else getting this problem? I can't say i've tested other games recently, but this happens during Battlefield 4. I have clips from Call
 of Duty that play just fine but they're from a few months ago.</p>

            <p>Wenn der Controller weniger als 3 Monate alt ist oder zur Konsole gehört kontaktiere direkt den Support: Support.xbox.com</p>
<p>Sollte der Controller aber alleine gekauft sein und älter als 3 Monate sein - Dann wirst du dich an den Händler wenden müssen und dem klar machen das er im Rahmen der Gewährleistung auch Pflichten hat.</p>
<p>Sollte der Controller sogar 24 Monate oder älter sein - Dann hast du gar keine Chance auf eine kostenlose Reparatur - Genau wie wenn du den Schaden selber verursacht hast.</p>

<p>That's because it's supposed to be there. This is a <em>command</em> button: click it to do what it says on it. If you were working offline, you wouldn't be able to send messages either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the symptoms of not being able to receive messages? </p>
<ul>
<li>Do you see <em>No new email messages&nbsp;</em>on the status bar after conducting a send/receive?</li><li>Send a test message to yourself.
<ul>
<li>Does it arrive in your inbox in Windows Live Mail?</li><li>If not, does it arrive in your inbox in webmail?</li><li>Do you see an error message? <br />
If so, please click on it to select it, then use right-click to copy it and paste it into your reply here.</li></ul>
</li><li>Does this affect more than one mail account?</li><li>What kind of account - HTTP, POP3 or IMAP? If you're not sure, right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. The type of account is given at the top of the <em>Server(s)</em> tab. The properties dialogue for an HTTP account has three tabs, for a POP3 account four and for an IMAP4 account five.</li><li>Are you accessing the affected account(s) by any other means, e.g. from a smart phone or tablet?</li></ul>

            <p>Thank you Wiki&nbsp;for taking attention to my problem. I will try to&nbsp;clarify your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* All mail arrive to my gmail account on computer, smartphone and tablet, but not to my Windows Live Mail at computer. (I save a copy of all mail at the server and before the Work Offline button was locked they also came to computer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>* It has worked good like this for several years until now. And I have done&nbsp;no Changes at any Place,</p>
<p>
</p><p>* There are no error message. When i press reload button happen nothing at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I just created another account, then suddenly all mail on server that I had not received arrived!</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I'm not sure what kind of account. I have two types<br />
1. Gmail: receiving: pop.gmail.com, sending: smtp.gmail.com&nbsp; <br />
2. POP3: receiving: POP3; mailin.telia.com, out: SMTP; mailout.teluia.com </p>
<p>I have had like this for several years without any problems at all </p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating a new gmail account, and then received the missing messages and after that back to the problem, I'm now even more confused. But may be it's a thread for an professional...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Axel</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, Gmail will only allow messages to be downloaded by POP3 to one client unless you configure the account to use 'recent mode'. Please check this article:
<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/47948?hl=sv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Using POP on multiple clients or mobile devices</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't able to make contact with Telia, but it could be that they use Google to provide their email service. If this is the case, then the same applies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't think that is your problem. Look at the bottom right-hand corner of the window - that tells you the current status. Does it read&nbsp;

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>Yes, it says Working Online.</p>
<p>
New news! When I looked in Live Mail this morning (computer was on during the night) all missing mails was downloaded!! But not possible to receive any mails that are sent to me after that... May be the problems are located at the web server?<br />
What do you think?

            <p>The minidump files showed two stop errors, SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e) and KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (1e), both being caused by the AppleCharger.sys.</p>
<p>The AppleCharger.sys may be a component of the Gigabyte utility "On/Off Charge".</p>
<p>So try uninstalling&nbsp; "On/Off Charge" and see if the BSODs resolve.</p>

</p><p>Currently there is an active&nbsp;<span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Service Alert</a></span>&nbsp;which is consistent with most errors occurring in the involvement of digital

</p><p>The website allows us to notify you when the services are back up through the notify me selection in the green bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our suggestions are to follow basic troubleshooting procedures as our engineers release a patch throughout each region for all users.</p>

<h2>            Konverter gekauft, aber schlechtes Bild und keinen Ton &#91;Converters purchased, but bad picture and no sound&#93;</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo Community, habe mir schon seit langer Zeit einen Hd PVR gekauft, jedoch hatte ich das Proble, dass mein Monitor nur einen HDMI Eingang hat, jedoch brauche ich einen YPbPr Eingang für den Hd PVR. Jetzt habe ich mir einen Konverter gekauft und das passende
 Kabel, das von der Xbox auf den Hd PVR läuft und dan über den Konverter und dann zum HDMI Eingang des Monitors. Folgendes Problem: ich montierte alles so wie es sein sollte, richtige Stecker in den richtigen Ausgang, habe es ein paar mal überprüft. Das Bild
 auf dem Monitor war gelblich und es kam kein Ton über meine Suround Anlage, die an den Monitor geschlossen ist. Danach habe ich die Xbox Kabel nur über den Konverter laufen lassen, dann war das Bild in einer schlechten Auflösung und es kam wieder kein Ton.
 Konverter Model: Ligawo ® YPbPr HDMI Konverter - Cinch Component zu HDMI Konverter Adapter Wandler + SPDIF + Cinch rot/weiß Audio zu HDMI + Signalverstärkung + 1080p und HDCP Monitor: Samsung Sync Master 2330 Hdmi Kabel: Xbox Edition Ypbpr Kabel: Xbox Edition<br />
<br />
<em>[Translation: <span>Hi community, bought a HD PVR me for a long time, but I had the proble, that my monitor has only a HDMI input, but I need a YPbPr input for the HD PVR.
</span><span>Now I have bought me a converter and the appropriate cable, which runs from the Xbox to the HD PVR and dan about the converter and then to the HDMI input of the monitor.
</span><span>The following problem: I mounted everything so how it should be correct plugs into the right output, have it a couple of times checked.
</span><span>The image on the monitor was yellowish and there was no sound through my surround system which is connected to the monitor.

<h2>            My purchased Skype number is not connected with my &#39;new&#39; Skype account set up when I &#40;at MS&#39;s suggestion&#41; changed to signing in via Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>The new Skype is driving me crazy. I followed Microsoft's recommendation to change to signing in with my Microsoft ID, and since then all is bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have bought and paid for a Skype number, 360 ************. It is not connected to my account now, and does not function. No one can call me while traveling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to reach support, but there is none. You always get routed to 'community forum' and yet hardly ever get a response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to the good old Skype that worked??</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old Skype name was ***************. I cannot even tell what my 'new' one is. It shows up as '**', but displays *****************when you click on it. But Skype doesn't accept that as a Skype handle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chat support doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, please, someone help me before I abandon Skype and have to go find some service that worked. I've been paying Skype $50 a year for this phone number, and it upsets me that you have screwed the whole thing up. I want my old Skype that works back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that there are now two Skype accounts. Each has money credit. But there is no procedure to merge the accounts, or move the money credit to just one of them (preferably my original&nbsp;************** account). And no live or even chat support appears
 to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, why are you doing this to us? I've been a Skype customer for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Moderator Notes: Please do not post any Personal Identifiable Information, like your Skype username and the details of the Skype Number. For your own security, we have masked some of your post. Thank you.</p>

    <title>only 1&#47;4 of video shows in top left corner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> just jon  say:</h3>
<h2>            only 1&#47;4 of video shows in top left corner</h2>
                    since uploading windows 8.1 it seems most videos will only show 1/4 of screen, top left. try watching football or youtube and most videos will show 3/4 green screen and top leftt 1/4 this video, and just that quarter, not the whole thing only smaller.
 also does it on media player when I try to play back a video that I've done with my camera. I've noticed that on Chrome the full picture is there unless I try to go to full screen. On explorer it won't even show more than the 1/4 screen when it is smaller.
 I'm getting a bit frustrated because I can't seem to find anywhere that there is even any mention of this problem except in firefox. any help? please?

==========================================<br />
I'm guessing you have a video driver issue.<br />
<br />
May be worth a try search the support sites <br />
of your computer manufacturer and/or video <br />
adapter manufacturer for an updated Win 8.1<br />
compatible video driver...<br />
<br />
Also...the following links may be worth a look:<br />

            <p>If&nbsp;completely new&nbsp;new windows profile is created then everything works fine in the same system&nbsp;with the same drivers and other programs installed but in this new profile only. It means that this is not machine or drivers or codecs&nbsp;related but this effect&nbsp;is
 due to some misconfiguration that Windows update spoils. The question to Microsoft is where such information is stored and how to update the configuration file so everything returns to normal operation. If I would have time then I would find out but this is

    <title>Win7, AMD ATI RS880 &#38; DVD&#58; HL-DT-ST DH40N ATA does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kc_dear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7, AMD ATI RS880 &#38;  DVD&#58; HL-DT-ST DH40N ATA does not write&#47; as writer-right soution or driver please</h2>
                    <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>The Problem is DVD Rom Drive is working as a reader and not writer, as stated below.<br />
It is Acer Veriton M430 ( as per bios info) With:<br />
&nbsp; AMD Sempron(tm) 150 Processor<br />
&nbsp; WDC WD3200AAJS-22L7A0 ATA DEVICE, (Sata 3GB/s cavair blue, RAID Ready)<br />
&nbsp; BIOSP01B1&nbsp; CHIPSET:AMD ATI RS880<br />
&nbsp; DVD: HL-DT-ST DH40N ATA (RAID)<br />
Bios Has Option to change RAID to AHCI, Both work but Exact match of the driver doesn't get loaded so that the DVD Rom works fine.<br />
Tried AMD AHCI compatible RAID Controller ver. 3.2.1540.35 [04-12-2009] and also tried
<br />
AMD AHCI compatible RAID Controller ver. 3.6.1540.127 [17-03-2009]--also installed.</p>
<p>System Info does not reflect SATA driver in Software section and The Driver loaded by the CDROM is shown as cdrom.sys, ver. 6.1.7600.16385 [21-06-2006] and<br />
Hard Disk drives dvrs:<br />
disk.sys, partmgr.sys - both ver. 6.1.7600.16385 dt&nbsp; 21-06-2006.<br />
Please guide me in detail as to what combination of setting and driver version will install the DVD ROM drive to write again. Please intimate the source/ availabilty of exact driver and ways to install. I have tried various options till now. I shall be grateful.<br />
Thanks Dears.</p>

            <p>You need to go back into the bios and set the correct boot device.&nbsp; If it is a UEFI install, you need to set the Windows Boot Manger as first.&nbsp; If it is a Legacy install, you need to put the drive the boot files are on as the first device.</p>

<p>Hiya Daz.1</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>It's not a common issue but it does happen, so the best thing to do would be to backup the data and content to avoid interruptions. We also noticed that with newer games what happens is that when the patches get released they are patches for the entire

<p>Hey Alex thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated by fellow XBF Jeremy Z&nbsp;<span>It's not a common issue but it does happen, so the best thing to do would be to backup the data and content to avoid interruptions. We also noticed that with newer games what happens is that when the patches

<p>This is something that the developers saw fit in order to minimize installation problems and game file corruptions. It is by design so there is no workaround. Hope this helps.</p>

            as mentioned its not a common issue, and within the update it does a fresh install I believe. are you a member of the insider program? I would recommend downloading it from the store, you can give feedback and report problems there for the team to look
 into.&nbsp;
