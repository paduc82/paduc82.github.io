            <pre>See ways you free up space in Windows 10:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/
Also see how to use the free Treesize utility to free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Also:
Open Start, type: view advanced system
Hit Enter
Click the System Protection tab
Select drive D
Click Configure
Toggle off system protection.
Other Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn‚Äôt intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don‚Äôt want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don‚Äôt see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn‚Äôt backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore ‚Äì System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn‚Äôt really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It‚Äôs fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<p>If the OP's issue is the same as mine, it's that there is a new drive, D, on my computer after the latest Windows update. Its contents cannot be viewed (just a blank window in Explorer). Windows continuously sends out warnings that this D drive has run out
 of space.&nbsp; It just showed up suddenly after the latest Windows 10 update, perhaps used as some kind of partition in the update process.</p>

 and I can use their forums just as well. These companies get so large they automate everything to cut costs. Customer support is dead. This is my last windows pc

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 pen pairing problem.</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 4 pen cannot pair with Surface. Normal it working.<br />
I thought that the pen battery is out of electric charge, then I bought a new pair battery. The problem is still running. Can someone help me, please?<br />

<p>We're glad to know that everything is up-to-date. However, if the light on your pen doesn't turn on, we suggest you to follow these troubleshooting steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hold the pen cap down for one second, then release.</li><li>If the LED does not come on, you may need to reseat the AAAA battery in the pen.</li><li>Attempt to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023523/surface-troubleshoot-microsoft-surface-pen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pair</a></strong> the pen.</li><li>Replace the AAAA battery. If the LED does not come on, you may request a replacement, go to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Service and Repair</a></strong> and select the Surface device you're using. You need to make sure that it is still under warranty.

<h2>            Willl deleting my Skype account also delete my Gmail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So my question is simple.&nbsp; I have a skype account with a gmail login.&nbsp; It has a different password to my actual gmail account.&nbsp; Will deleting my skype account also delete my actual gmail account or just the Microsoft gmail account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that Microsoft would have no jurisdiction over a Google service, but I have to be sure.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Your Gmail email address, definitely will not be closed since as you have mentioned, Microsoft doesn't have jurisdiction over Gmail. What the system will delete is the Microsoft account created in the back ground using the Gmail
 email address. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you're using your Gmail email to sign in to any Microsoft products including Skype, then deleting the Skype account will prevent you from signing in to all Microsoft products. However, you can still use the same Gmail email address
 to create a new Microsoft account, 60 days after you closed your Skype account. This will give you a brand new Microsoft account.</span></p>

<p>Hi Jannine_P</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still left with this problem after trying all the things you suggest.&nbsp; I was still unable to contact Live Chat.&nbsp; I am not the only one with this problem in the UK.&nbsp; Anyone trying to call me from America will establish a call for a brief second, then
 it stops.&nbsp; I have to be at the computer to see this happen.&nbsp; Then I call them straight back.&nbsp; Is there any other way you can help?&nbsp; I cannot seem to contact Skype at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>
<p>Cathy</p>

            <p>‚ÄãHi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true: </p>
<ul>
<li>You are running Windows Vista and have not updated to Service Pack 1 or a later version.
</li><li>The Basic Input/output System (BIOS) system that is installed on the computer reduces power to the port to which the input device is connected.
<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b> You may be unable to use Bluetooth devices to resume operation from certain power management states (such as "suspend" or "hibernate"). In some low-power states, the wireless transceiver may be unable to receive information from the Bluetooth devices.
</li><li>You are using a portable or notebook computer that does not allow resume by using a Bluetooth device. If you are having problems waking a laptop by using a Bluetooth device, see Method 3 first.
</li><li>The Keyboard item in Control Panel is not configured to wake the computer when you press a key on the keyboard.
</li><li>Your computer may have encountered a system problem. </li><li>The Sleep key on your keyboard is configured incorrectly.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Try the steps provided in the following Microsoft Support article and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshoot problems waking computer from sleep mode</strong>:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Try updating the all the drivers from the computer manufacturer's website and check.</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also try disconnecting the SSD drive and check if the issue persists.</p>

What disk are you referring to? The camera referred to<br />
in this three year old thread records on Mini DV Tapes.<br />
<br />
If you have a question it would be best if you begin a <br />

            <p>I found that Kaspersky Antivirus was part of my problem. Not only was it keeping runtimebroker at a high cpu but it also broke the Start Menu not allowing things to be added or deleted to the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Kaspersky and things were better for awhile but now runtimebroker is up and down. Sometimes it's thrashing the cpu and other times it's idle at 0%.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Backwards compatibility issues</h2>
                    <p>My xbox one x is connected to xbox live but when I try to play a 360 backwards compatible game the 360 board says can't connect to xbox live. My internet connection is fine. I can watch YouTube and play Xone games without problems but backwards compatibility
 is still broken. I tried clearing local 360 data but that didn't work. Now, I can't sign in at all in backwards compatibility. Is there something I can do or is there something wrong with backwards compatibility servers?</p>

            The Official Xbox Twitter page has suggested removing and redownloading the game to trouble shoot the problem. I'd also recomend keeping tuned in there to keep up to date.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you aware of any software or hardware changes made on the PC prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior can be the result of a problem or error when an app package was first installed or injected into the Windows 8 or 8.1 image, or it can be the result of out-of-date software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the article and follow the troubleshooting and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong><strong>Windows 8 app tiles have an "x" in the lower right corner<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2832072/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2832072/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there‚Äôs a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apps troubleshooter</a>. This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps.</p>

<h2>            Require password on wakeup not working.</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a Surface Pro 3 and I want to make it so when the computer sleeps, it asks for a password when it wakes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it set to require password on wakeup in the control panel and I do have a password enabled, it asks for it and everything works fine when the computer restarts. When I press the power button to put it to sleep or if I let it idle long enough for it
 to sleep and I try to wake it up it just skips the password and takes me back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a moment, it does show that the computer is locked. When I swipe up it shows my account since it's already logged in and it says "Locked" for a split second before logging in. I've included some (blurry) pictures to help show what's going on.</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forums. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Are you using Type Cover designed for Surface Pro 3?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Power-saving state built into Surface Pro 3 InstantGo resumes even more quickly. Only the Type Cover designed for Surface Pro 3 puts it into InstantGo.Refer to section ‚ÄúOn, off, sleep or InstantGo, and restart‚Äù from this article:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Surface Pro power states: On, off, sleep, and hibernate</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/surface-power-sleep-and-wake-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/surface-power-sleep-and-wake-pro</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information on InstantGo refer this link:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>InstantGo: a better way to sleep</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/06/19/instantgo-a-better-way-to-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/06/19/instantgo-a-better-way-to-sleep/</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If instantGo is not the issue then to fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Therefore, let's first be sure to check your Power Options and restore them back to their default state. At the Start screen:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong>Power Options</strong> and when the search screen appears, tap on
<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;in the right hand side of the screen.</li><li>Then tap <strong>Power Options</strong> to the left side.</li><li>The Power Options window will now appear on your Desktop.&nbsp;</li><li>Tap <strong>Change plan setting</strong>.</li><li>Take note of the default times set for <strong>Dim the Display</strong> and <strong>
Put the computer to sleep</strong>. You could then time how long it takes to put the computer to sleep and then test waking it back up. You might even shorten the time to test the sleep and wake up function.</li><li>Once you're done testing, you'll need to repeat the above steps and then tap on
<strong>Restore default settings for this plan</strong>, as the default settings are the most optimized for our Surface tablets.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Run the power troubleshooter. Follow these steps:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press the ‚ÄòWindows + W‚Äô key on the keyboard.<br />
b) Type Troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.<br />
c) Click system and security and run the power troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> <span>Download and install latest hardware drivers for your computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Download and install drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also try changing the power plan. Change the ‚ÄúPower plans‚Äù settings. A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings (like display, sleep, etc.) that manages how your PC uses power. The power plans you can use depend on the kind
 of PC you have.</span></p>
