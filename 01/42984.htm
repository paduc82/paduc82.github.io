            Despite dozens and dozens of attempts, following all suggestions exactly, my other Win10 computer could only resolve this issue by following support suggestions from Norton 360, uninstalling 360, turning on Defender, updating Defender, turning OFF Defender,
 reinstalling 360. That all worked on it. I'll mark the answer which worked for me on THIS Win10 installation. &nbsp;Thanks everyone and good luck if you're still looking. Persist and you'll find the answer. :-)

            Method 1 leads to solutions that appear not to apply to Windows 10, so not much help there. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Method 2 is FAR too complicated, and actually unnecessary as other WAY simpler solution worked fine. Sorry.

            <p>Actually, it isn't a problem, because when having another antivirusprogram installed, Windows Defender NORMALLY automatic gets deactivated, and that's why you can't update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's because it's not good to have two antivirusprograms running on the computer.</p>

<p>Any actual solutions?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Windows forum has more wrong answers for this question than you can shake a stick at – and that’s probably because everyone here seems to have assumed that this is a Windows Update issue. But it’s actually caused by a failure to update the
</span><em><span>DisableAntiSpyware </span></em><span>and </span><em><span>Disable Antivirus</span></em><span> DWORDS in the Windows Defender registry key when a third-party AV app is installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This puts Windows Defender into a state of limbo (an indeterminate state) between being turned off in the Security Center, and turned on in its own registry key – and one of the side effects of this error state is failed definition updates. So the
 issue can be resolved by any action that completely disables Defender. Properly uninstalling, running the cleanup utility, and reinstalling should theoretically resolve the issue; but this has been reported to fail, especially for Norton products. Disabling
 Windows Defender in the </span><em><span>Policies</span></em><span> registry key also solves the definition update problem – but only by overriding the faulty entries in the
</span><em><span>Windows Defender</span></em><span> key. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But when I reproduced this issue on a test machine running Avast Free, I found that the issue could be fully resolved in about 1 minute&nbsp;by following&nbsp;these simple steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>1.)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Disable Avast completely (“permanently”) with the shields control.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Start Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Enable Avast with the shields control.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This apparently triggers the same mechanism that normally gets triggered with a clean install of the Avast app. Since a similar solution for Norton apps was reported in this discussion thread, I’m thinking that the above steps might also be applicable
 for other third-party AV apps:</span></p>

    <title>Xbox rejecting HD over Component settings. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e1idian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox rejecting HD over Component settings.</h2>
                    
<p>So having a bit of trouble getting the xbox to use 1080i over component. The annoying part is it actually works, but the xbox won't use it.</p>
<p>So I have the xbox connected with component to the TV, that works fine. In display settings I can selected 720p/1080i/1080p, and *they work*. The screen flickers for a sec as it should, then a new picture comes up with a message asking me to confirm the
 new display settings. The TV recognises the new resolution, and a message (from the TV) appears and tells me it's 1080p (or whatever). I say "yes" I want to keep these settings, but then the xbox just reverts to SD again.</p>
<p>I have a message on the display settings page telling me 'my cable has HDTV resolutions disabled' or something to that effect, which makes no sense to me. There is no such switch on my cable, and as outlined above the cable seems to have no trouble connecting
 with higher resolutions perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Yes I can just use another TV... but that seems like a pretty weak solution to a problem that has no logical existence in the first place.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help fixing this, it's greatly appreciated :)</p>

<p>(as a side note, my SD resolution is for some reason 720x480i. Shouldn't it be 720x576i, given I have an Australian console and an Australian TV? The labels for refresh rate are still PAL-50 and PAL-60, so it seems to think it's PAL)</p>

<p>The component cable that comes with the xbox only puts out that resolution, it's not very good. If you would like to have full HD and audio I would suggest that you might look into getting an HDMI cable.

<p>okay so on your xbox, go to settings, display and go to display discovery! turn that off! and re-attempt to select a High Rez Setting! i would suggest 1080P since that is a Higher Resoultion then 1080I if 1080P doest work try 1080I, if nether work.... Does
 your TV &amp; xbox support HDMI? if they do i would Greatly Suggest Switching to HDMi over Compoent cables for a richer Quailty Picture.</p>

            <p>If you installed windows 10 more than 30 days ago you cannot go back to 8.1 easily. It might be better to give more info--model computer, was windows 8.1 installed by the computer manufacturer and why you want to go back. Maybe someone here can help you
 fix windows 10 so you don't have to go back to 8.1. Check your computer's support page to see if your model is approved for upgrading. If it is approved there will be win 10 drivers and software available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot go back to 8.1--You will need installation media from the computer maker if win 8.1 came installed. The Create Media link only works if windows 8.1 is still active on the computer and has not been upgraded to 10. You do not need an activation
 key if windows 8.1 was installed by the computer maker. The key is embedded in the computer bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is less than 30 days--go to Settings, Update &amp; Security, Recovery and the option to return to 8.1 will be there.</p>

            Windows 10 default Skype has very basic features. Probably future versions may have more features. You can install new Skype (v8) which is the latest from Skype and has a lot of features and is the way to go.
<br />
<br />Download New Skype - <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />You should do it through Web Skype or v8 Skype (Add to Favourites will work only in v8 Skype where right click will give Add to Favourites option)
<br />
<br />v8 Skype - Dial a number (mobile or landline) &gt; Cancel the call or finish the call &gt; This number will become available on left side, right click &gt; View profile &gt; Add to Skype &gt; Now, you can change the number to Name above by clicking Pencil icon on right side
<br />
<br />Web Skype - Another way is to do through Web Skype and it will reflect in Skype client also. 
<br />Open Web Skype and make the call - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />Cancel the call or finish the call
<br />Now right click on called number &gt; View profile
<br />You get option for Add to Contacts

            v12 is a Store app. I do understand that it may cause confusion as now there are two versions existing for Windows 10 - One is v12 which is stock Windows 10 Skype app and one is Desktop version where you download exe file and install that. This is v8. By logic , v12 should be many notches above v8 but unfortunately reverse is the case.
<br />
<br />Earlier Desktop version was 7 and new version which has replaced v7 is v8.

            The threat to stop is for v7 not for v8. If you use v7, you will constantly be nagged to use v8.
<br />
<br />You can peacefully use this. v8 is the future and all new features and functions have been coming in v8 only.
<br />
<br />Both v12 and v8 co-exist together and don't interfere with each other except at one time, you can use only one. So if v8 is open, you can't use v12.

            I tried removing adobe reader but the error is still there. This occurs whenever I upload my resume to the PETCO.com site. I posted the query in Adobe forums but there was no response.

</p><p>Even though you might get this message, you can always run Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver.
</p>
<p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>
<p>Type: <strong>wuapp</strong></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Check for updates (make sure you have an active Internet connection). </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fae4aab2-f41d-4451-9a39-0638d8c8e187" /></p>
<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

    <title>Transfert d&#39;un compte Xbox vers un autre compte microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> playoff35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfert d&#39;un compte Xbox vers un autre compte microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Bonjour, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Il y a plusieurs années, j'ai crée un compte Xbox pour ma console acheté avec mon plus jeune frère. Nous avions pour habitude de jouer ensemble sur la même console. Aujourd'hui je ne joue plus à la Xbox et c'est mon frère qui y joue encore régulièrement.
 C'est également lui qui a acheté les derniers jeux présent sur le compte et qui règle l'abonnement gold. Cependant l'adresse mail associé au compte reste la mienne, celle de mon compte microsoft que j'utilise tout les jours pour les autres applications microsoft.
 J'aurais voulu savoir comment il était possible d'associer le compte Xbox au compte microsoft de mon frère maintenant qu'il est le seul à l'utiliser depuis 2-3 ans. Cela lui permettrait de pouvoir gérer de façon autonome le compte sans avoir à me demander
 le mdp quand je le change, et également de conserver tout les succès et les jeux qu'il a acquis depuis qu'il est le seul à utiliser la console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merci d'avance pour votre réponse</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cdlt</p>
<p>

    <title>mouse out of control - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cherylwilliams3  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse out of control</h2>
                    my mouse freezes &amp; unable to move a fair bit of the time. Have tried a restore point, brought a new mouse &amp; keyboard combo, had 2 IT people &amp; 2 over the phone remote access. They have not been able to help me. The mouse will freeze, I scroll the mouse
 wheel &amp; it will try to go in the other direction, it is if the mouse is in slow motion sometimes &amp; it is worse when I am able to get it on to an item &amp; (click right or left) it will not stay on the item, as I said it has a mind of its own. The symbol a capital
 I with a top &amp; bottom line appears for no reason. The IT guys tried to tell me it was the surface of my desk, so I used the mouse pad, thoroughly cleaned my desk for any residue that may be there. No difference. This mouse is behaving itself now at the moment
 while I am typing. I know it is not the mouse &amp; keyboard, my desktop is 11 months old, could it be a program or the computer itself. Hoping someone can help me, thank you.

            Hi Cheryl.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />Next in Device Manager open the Mouse driver, on Driver tab look for a Roll Back button and try that.  If not then use the Uninstall button, restart PC to reinstall Mouse.
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 11 to check for damaged System Files.  
<br />
<br />Then if that isn't sufficient go back through the rest of the steps.
<br />
<br />Look closely at all settings for the mouse in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Mouse and also there at the link for Additonal Mouse Options.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You do not need the app. It is web based. Just search for Google classroom in the search engine and click on the first item that says google classroom. Once there, make sure your child is logged in to the school's GAFE account. If your child is a member
 of any classrooms, he/she should see them then.

<p>When I first got 2k I installed it, or thought I did, and it said install stopped. I thought it would be fine but now when I try to finish the supposed install, it says that it needs the disc or that there are network errors(which is not the case seeing
 as I have used a wired and wireless connection). However, I can play the game offline, it loads perfectly fine there and everything. Please help I just want to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey lBerseker,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues with your install.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Just to double check, are you playing a disc version of the game or a digital download?<br />
<br />
If your game is still showing that it is just installing, you may want to try these steps on
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/downloadable-content/pause-stop-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Cancelling an Installation on Xbox One</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Once you've cancelled the install, try redownloading or installing the game.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I connect a display port monitor and the Surface Dock power cable to my Surface Book at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I connect a display port monitor and the Surface Dock power cable to my Surface Book at the same time?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Dock power cable prevents a display port cable to be attached at the same time.&nbsp; I was thinking about cutting the side of the display port plug in order to make this fit unless if anyone knows of a display port cable brand that already has
 this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW this is the only way for me to have 2 external 4K monitors running at 60Hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough I can get this to work on my 2017 Surface Pro.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing the photo with us. We realize the need for you to connect the display port cable directly to your Surface device. On this regard, we suggest that you visit our
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Store</a> to discuss what option you can use for you to be able to connect both the Surface Dock power cable and the display port cable at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>That hasn't been my experience.&nbsp; I have both the SP4 and the SP2017 and they&nbsp;both can support 2 4K monitors running at 60Hz.&nbsp; One monitor through the Surface Dock and the other monitor through the mini display port.&nbsp; Both my external monitors are Dell P2715Qs.&nbsp;
 So far I'm unable to get the Surface Book to do this.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span>Since the initial troubleshooting that was provided seems doesn't fix the issue, we also suggest following the steps below and check if it makes any difference:</span><br />
<br />
<span>Solution 1 – Run netsh winsock reset command</span><br />
<br />
<span>1. Press&nbsp;</span><span>Windows Key + X</span><span>&nbsp;and choose&nbsp;</span><span>Command Prompt</span><span>&nbsp;from the menu.</span><br />
<span>2. When Command Prompt starts, enter the following and press Enter to run it:</span><br />
<br />
<span><em>netsh winsock reset</em></span><br />
<br />
<span>3. Close Command Prompt and restart your computer.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Solution 2 – Remove problematic software</span><br />
<br />
<span>• Certain software can cause a random freeze on Windows 10. Users have reported that software such as Speccy, Acronis True Image, Privatefirewall, McAfee and Office Hub App can cause problems with Windows 10. If you have
 any of these programs installed on your computer, we advise that you remove them by following these steps:</span><br />
<br />
<span>1. Open&nbsp;</span><span>Settings App</span><span>&nbsp;and go to&nbsp;</span><span>System</span><span>.</span><br />
<span>2. Go to&nbsp;</span><span>Apps &amp; features</span><span>&nbsp;section and delete the aforementioned apps.</span><br />
<span>3. After you’ve uninstalled these apps,&nbsp;</span><span>restart&nbsp;</span><span>your computer.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Solution</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>3&nbsp;</span><span>–&nbsp;</span><span>Disable&nbsp;</span><span>F</span><span>.</span><span>lux</span><br />
<br />
<span>It seems that F.lux software has some compatibility issues with certain display drivers. Due to these issues, you might experience a random freeze on Windows 10. In order to fix this problem, it’s advised that you disable
 F.lux software on your computer. If you want to keep using this software, you can also try updating your display drivers to the newest version.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Solution&nbsp;</span><span>4&nbsp;</span><span>–&nbsp;</span><span>Disconnect&nbsp;</span><span>all&nbsp;</span><span>USB&nbsp;</span><span>devices</span><br />
<br />
<span>• USB devices such as external hard drive, printers, etc. can sometimes cause Windows 10 to freeze randomly. If you have any USB devices connected to your computer, you should disconnect them before you turn on your computer.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Solution 5 – Download latest chipset</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>drivers</span><br />
<br />
<span>• To update your chipset drivers, you need to visit your motherboard manufacturer’s website and download latest chipset drivers for your motherboard.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Solution 6 – Update network drivers</span><br />
<br />
<span>• You might want to visit your network adapter manufacturer’s website to download the latest drivers.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Solution 7 – Update your BIOS</span><br />
<br />
<span>• To perform a BIOS update, you have to visit your motherboard manufacturer’s website and download the latest version of BIOS.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Get back to us if the issue still persists.</span></p>

            Hi wizeaowl 
<br />
<br />The Word Starter 2010 software  was originally provided by the manufacturer of your PC, that was a deal done with Microsoft, that version of Office did not come with a product key and was not downloadable
<br />
<br />The only place to get a copy of that software is from the support page for your PC on the manufacturers website. If that is not available there, contact their support team, they can probably supply you with a link to download the Starter pack . . .

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Microsoft noted as far back as 2015 that Office Starter 2010 which includes Word Starter 2010 would not be compatible with Windows 10. In which case, it would be removed. 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to either purchase Office 2019 or consider a free suite such as Libre Office or Google Docs or even Microsoft Office online if you prefer the familiar Office experience.

<h2>            Error code&#58; 0xc0000225 - Missing or corrupted system registry file</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is currently running on Windows 10. It was fine and all until it suffered from a power failure (my battery was faulty and I had yet to replace it, so I had to plug the laptop in) and I cannot boot my laptop since. Immediately when I try to start
 my computer, I am presented with a BSOD with the following messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your PC/Device needs to be repaired</p>
<p>The operating system couldn't be loaded because the system registry file is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>File: \windows\system32\config\system</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000225</p>
<p>..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have basically tried everything (to the best of my knowledge, of course) at this point, which includes Startup Repair, CHKDSK, SFC /SCANNOW, BOOTREC Commands... You get the idea. Already created a USB boot. Still cannot fix the issue. Startup Repair couldn't
 repair the issues; CHKDSK reports that there is nothing wrong. I cannot return to a previous point either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I am missing because I really don't want to run a clean installation? Also, I cannot perform Reset or Refresh either. With the Refresh, there is nothing changed and when I plugged the USB in for the Reset, the screen shows the inserted
 media is not valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran a diagnostic check-up with my HDD and there is also nothing wrong. So I really don't understand whether this error comes from a hard drive problem or software one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help and thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 may have encountered a system file corruption and your USB installation media might also be corrupted. For us to assist you better, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your machine?</li><li>Can you still remember the current build and version of your Windows 10?<br />
</li><li>Have you made any changes on your BIOS previously?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, to isolate the issue further, we suggest that you try to re-download the Windows 10 ISO media or use another flash drive to see if there will be any changes if you'll perform a repair. We also recommend that you check this
