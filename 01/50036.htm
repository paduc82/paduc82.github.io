<h2>            Syncing Skype accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have had a Skype account for many years now. I have many contacts and messages not to mention credit on it, but when I got a new computer and tried to set up my Skype account on it somehow it doesn't recognize my old info! It now seems I have 2 accounts
 both connected to my email. No matter what I do, I can't log into my old one account on the new computer BUT still get it on my iPad! How can I sync these?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wi-fi Direct Virtual Adapter</h2>
                    <p>I can connect to the wifi on my laptop but whenever I actually go onto the internet (have tried multiple browsers thinking it was just google chrome to begin with) &nbsp;i get a blank page with an error screen that says "No data received"&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I then went through the device manager and "MICROSOFT WI-FI DIRECT VIRTUAL ADAPTER" had a yellow triangle, there were no driver software updates and all it would show was "ERROR CODE: 10" &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sound not playing on videos uploaded from cell phone, Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chloeryan88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound not playing on videos uploaded from cell phone, Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is an ASUS model S200E, and it is quite new-- I got it about half a year ago. I have Windows 8.1. My phone is an Android LG Google smartphone, but it is a few years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to make a slideshow of photos and videos in Movie Maker, but there's been quite a few problems. USBs malfunctioning, sound not working, videos not playing right... the list goes on and on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried connecting my phone to my laptop with a USB cable to download the pictures from my phone's camera to my laptop, but nothing happened-- my phone didn't show up as a device on the file explorer, and usually when I connect my phone with another device
 a message pops up on my phone asking to turn on file sharing or whatnot. This did not happen. I tried all three of the USB slots on my laptop but none of them worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if it was my phone or my laptop not working, I tried the same thing (connecting with a USB) to my other computer, a Lenovo. I was able to successfully download all the pictures and videos to that computer, and the sound on the videos worked (I opened/played
 them with Windows Media Player), so I know the problem is not the phone. &nbsp;(I think...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my other computer (the one where the videos worked) I copied all the videos and photos onto a memory stick, and tried inputting that into my laptop. At first, nothing happened... my laptop didn't even recognize there was a memory stick. I'm not sure exactly
 what I did, but after messing around for a couple minutes and a few tries, it recognized the memory stick and let me copy the photos and videos into a file on my laptop, and use them in the Movie Maker application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I was in the clear and everything was working, but then my sound started acting up. No sound would come out of headphones OR speakers (built-in, Realtek High Definition Audio) on Youtube, Google, Windows Media Player, Movie Maker, etc. I used the
 Audio troubleshooter but it came up clear-- suggested turning my volume up (it was at max...) I tried all kinds of suggestions from various other help sites, such as checking the speaker's device status, going to Device Manager&gt; Sound, video and game controllers
 &gt; Realtek H D Audio, and checking that it was working (it was), to just name a few. I forget exactly the steps I followed to do these things (I'm writing this a day or so later) but I remember checking the sound chip (If that makes any sense), the driver...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually after tampering around a bit, the sound worked on everything but Movie Maker. I tried rebooting, and that seemed to help a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My sound is off and on. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt, but the sound from the videos downloaded from Phone&gt; Other computer &gt; Memory stick &gt; Laptop NEVER works. The videos play smoothly but there is absolutely
 no sound in Windows Media Player, Movie Maker, Videos, Gallery, etc... no sound in any of the applications I've tried using to play the videos.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've spent hours troubleshooting and trying to fix this problem, but nothing's worked so far. I'm not ultra tech-savvy but I can follow instructions well enough... Please help! I don't know what else to try, and getting sound on these videos is really important
 to me. I'm happy to answer any questions about any of the devices if it would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. This is just a passing observation and might have no rapport to the problem, but I think I've noticed that the sound from everything on Google Chrome (or other Internet browsers, I wouldn't know, I only use the one) doesn't work when Movie Maker is open.
 When I closed Movie Maker, the sound started working again. This might be just a fluke, not sure.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I tried opening the videos on several different computers using different forms of like moving them (CD, memory stick, etc) but the videos only work on the one computer. I looked at the format of the videos I am trying to play, and it turns out they are
 .gp3 files, a more un-used kind of file format, I'm guessing due to the age of the cellphone they were taken with (It is two and a half years old).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the problem is that Windows 8 and 8.1 are <em>too&nbsp;</em>advanced for the older files. This does not make much sense, as you would think that the makers of these new systems would take these old formats into account, but oh well. This would also
 make sense because the videos played perfectly, with sound, on my other Windows 7 laptop that is a few years old.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some searching, I found that some of these more obscure versions of videos were not supported by most video-playing applications, including Windows Media Player. You had to download other software (codecs) to play the videos. I downloaded the Windows
 Essentials Media Codec Pack off of Download.com (link below, this is a trusted site as far as I know, and I have used it for several software downloads, it has a good reputation) and now I am able to, when opening videos, select that media player to open them.
 They play successfully with sound now, however:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still unable to play the videos with sound in Movie Maker, the application that I want to put the videos in to make a slideshow/presentation. How can I play .gp3 files properly (with sound) in the Movie Maker application??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is where you can download the codec to play the files:</p>
<p>http://download.cnet.com/Windows-Essentials-Media-Codec-Pack/3000-13632_4-10662709.html</p>

<h2>            Call Of Duty Black Ops </h2>
                    
<p>I dont know how to send a message personally to xbox so im putting the message on here.</p>
<p>My friend and i can connect in a lobby but when we search for a game we end up in different games. Also if i join his game then he gets kicked. I want to know how to get it to work again as it isnt as fun playing on your own.
</p>
<p>While im on the subject of the black ops servers, i was so annoyed that i took a photo of a the loading screan that appears when there is a 'connection interupted' pause on the screen. I had to wait until the 'awaiting gamestate' reached 100 before i had
 to go to the dashboard in order to get away from the page. </p>
<p>I am not very happy with the way Black Ops is going and i would appreaciate it if you could do somehting about it.
</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<h2>            Lost network drive connections, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am loosing the use of network drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to disable firewall, and antivirus, and reboot the drive and laptop to get them back for a few moments. &nbsp;Lenovo Carbon X1 with docking station, updated network drivers. &nbsp;Seagate Central device, Nortons Security Suite. &nbsp;I have another system on Windows
 10 doing the same things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"lost" goes from completely gone in "This PC", to RED X on the connections. &nbsp;Most grievous. &nbsp;If I reboot, drives (with red x may pop up, or may not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most times I can ping the devices IP addresses. &nbsp;Then when its really gone, I cannot ping by device/hostname. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things were working OK. &nbsp;The system updates (or one of the many) around 8/17 broke something. &nbsp;I no longer have a non-Windows 10 system to run parallel tests. &nbsp;The drives seem to be timed out even while processes are running to read/write on them. &nbsp;If its
 a timer somewhere the timer is NOT catching drive activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see dozens of posts all over the internet, and I have tried most of what I could find that had an action to no avail. &nbsp;I have updated drivers until I am nauseous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with the firewall and antivirus OFF, the connections will be broken after getting them back for a few moments. &nbsp;Its not&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP is most needed, and your reply posts are graciously appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE, and tell me how to revert to prior OS. &nbsp;I have spent many hours of labor on this and am not one bit further along. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused due to device driver compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to update the chipset and the BIOS and you might also try to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about compatibility, refer to the below link:</p>

<h2>            Win10 - Error&#58; 0xc000000d - Recovery</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I bought an compaq laptop</span><span>, with Windows 10 pre-installed on the laptop from the factory, already. Used it normally for around one year, and one day the drive from
 the touchpad stopped to work. I restarted the system and it came back to work without any issues. After I used the laptop that day I shutted it down without make any change, install nothing etc, and when I turned it on back again I got blue-screen'd with the
 following message:<br />
<br />
"Recovery<br />
<br />
Your PC needs to be repaired<br />
<br />
A required device isn't connected or can't be accessed<br />
<br />
<br />
Error Code: 0xc000000d<br />
<br />
You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your system administrator or PC manufacturer."<br />
<br />
I tried to boot the system with the Win10 &nbsp;but not worked. Aparently any command from the keyboard like ALT+f10 and others are working</span></p>
<p><span><br />
What to do? Need find a way to boot the system. Please help, waiting for answers.<br />
Here a pic from the blue screen.</span></p>

<p>If you are still experiencing the same issue after changing the compatibility settings on your computer, we suggest that you perform a clean boot to
<span>start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10. Go to this

            From the look of your screenshots, you are using a Intel graphics card. The game will not work with that hardware. You need either a AMD graphics or Nvidia graphics card. You should check the minimum requirements on the store before you make a purchase,
 then you wont get into this sort of issue in the future.

<p>Hey Kerllon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As our Ambassador mentioned, the minimum requirements for that game says an Nvidia graphics card is what's needed. In the notes of the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/minecraft-story-mode-season-two/9mwb4n4v937x?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0#activetab=pivot:regionofsystemrequirementstab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
system requirements </a>for the game on the Microsoft Store it also says, "Additional: Not recommended for Intel integrated graphics."</p>
<p>

<p>Hey Kerllon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that is the reason why the game is not working. It states on the minimum requirements for the game that an NVIDIA graphics card will work best and that it's not recommended to use your PC's integrated Intel graphics card. Not having the optimal
 graphics card can affect the way DirectX works while it handles the programming for pretty much all of your games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you can't really uninstall the Direct X software directly, you can try to repair it. I suggest looking at this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/games_windows_10/any-way-to-repair-dx12-without-having-to-reinstall/48c575b9-2a12-495a-a329-c4c749f67a1e">
thread </a>to see if there is any helpful solutions for you or you may need to get an NVIDIA graphics card.</p>

            <p>HI,</p>
<p>Reading between the lines a bit here, this is my understanding...</p>
<ol>
<li>You never use Ethernet, presumably because you don't have broadband for whatever reason?</li><li>Because of the size of the download, you asked someone else to do it who did have broadband?</li><li>Following this, the icon which is two screens with a red X appeared but it never used to be there?</li></ol>
<p>This icon with the red X is informative only. If you don't use Ethernet then you won't have a cable connected meaning that the information that you see regarding "network cable is unplugged" is correct. If you don't&nbsp;like this icon you can hide it...</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click an empty part of your taskbar and click Properties</li><li>Click the Notification Area tab</li><li>There you will see a tick box for Network, untick it and click OK to hide the icon</li><li>Reverse this process if you wnat to unhide the icon</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is your problem that you can no longer connect with dial up? If that is the case...</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start, type inetcpl.cpl and hit enter</li><li>Click the Connections tab</li><li>Is "Never dial a connection" selected? If it is, select "Always dial my default connection" (or "Dial whenever a network connection is not present")</li><li>Click OK</li></ul>

                    I have an Acer Aspire 5516, with preinstalled Windows Vista. I didn't realize it didn't come with a recovery disc UNTIL my system crashed! During a routine virus scan I received a blue screen saying a major problem was found and system was shut down. I
 followed the directions to properly shut down my laptop. When I turned it back on after the "Acer" logo it went to a black screen with info about my computer and the last line states "operating system not found". This is when I found out there was no recovery
 disc &amp; it is built in to the system. To access this recovery system you us F8 to get into safe mode, then Alt F10 to access the "erecovery management system. Neither one of these functions are working! Still getting the black screen with 'operating system
 not found'. I have a Windows XP from my previous laptop. What I am wondering is if I can load this onto my Acer, possibly on a partition, in order to be able to get into my laptop and back up all my files? I am terrified of losi

            <p>hi</p>
<p>normally with an Acer you press Alt + F10 at Boot to start recovery from the hidden recovery partition, not F8, then that combo</p>
<p>but you may not have an option to save your data doing that</p>
<p>in everyday use acers normally have a system partition, a data partition to save your data, etc&nbsp;to,&nbsp;&nbsp;and also that hidden recovery partition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and read this about Data recovery, too;</p>
<p><b><u><span>Data Recovery</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>1. pull the hard drive out and slave it in another computer</span></p>
<p><span>2. buy or borrow a USB hard drive enclosure put yout hard drive in it then plug it&nbsp;into another computer and read the&nbsp;hard drive that way</span></p>
<p><span>3. try Knoppix</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>BUT this method 3 depends on your hardware working in the failed computer</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>read this Information about Method 3:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Download/Save the above Knoppix Live CD ISO file.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1 in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.

======================================<br />
What is the format of the music file? WMA is the best choice.<br />
<br />
I'm not offering the following links as *the* fix but<br />
maybe they will offer some ideas:<br />
<br />
Movie Maker 2 -<br />
How to fix "Class not registered"<br />
or 80040154 error<br />
<a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/guides/How_to_fix_Class_not_registered_or_80040154_error.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.free-codecs.com/guides/How_to_fix_Class_not_registered_or_80040154_error.htm</a><br />
<br />
And the following link may be worth a look:<br />
<br />
Movie Maker always has to close<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.moviemaker/msg/ae88267a9e023836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.moviemaker/msg/ae88267a9e023836</a><br />
<br />
Here's a link to a Google search that may<br />
offer something useful:<br />
<br />
"class not registered"<br />
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2v379o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2v379o</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; or...<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.moviemaker/search?hl=en&amp;group=microsoft.public.windowsxp.moviemaker&amp;q=&quot;class+not+registered&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.moviemaker/search?hl=en&amp;group=microsoft.public.windowsxp.moviemaker&amp;q=%22class+not+registered%22</a><br />
<br />
No guarantees...but it might be worth<br />
a try to run the following command.<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Run...and type (or copy / paste)<br />
the following...<br />
<br />
regsvr32 %windir%\system32\qdv.dll<br />
(yes, there's a space between the first 2 and %)<br />
<br />
Press Enter.<br />
<br />
You should see a dialog that says:<br />
<br />
DllRegisterServer in C:\WINDOWS\system32\qdv.dll succeeded <br />

=====================================<br />
Did you try converting the music&nbsp;file to the .wma format?<br />
<br />
Might be worth&nbsp; try to&nbsp;open Movie Maker and go to...Tools /<br />
Options / Compatibility tab and uncheck all the filters / OK.<br />
<br />
Slight possibility...maybe the following link would be worth <br />

I don't know that the AC3 filter will solve your issue but all <br />
you have to do is download it and left click it to install it.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums for assistance, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is most likely due to a game&nbsp;sharing issue from another account you had along with the account you are using on your old Xbox. What displays in the ready to install section is the digital content for every account on the console that has that console
 set as it's <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Home console</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you have another account on the older Xbox with purchased games as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to&nbsp;look over&nbsp;the account's order history to confirm you have purchased these game with the account you are trying to use.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 USB Crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niall power  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 USB Crashes</h2>
                    Hello, so after upgrading to windows 10 from windows 8.1 I have been having very frustrating crashes.<br />
After some time of the pc being turned on, sometimes 1 hour sometimes 4 hours, all USB devices (this includes mouse keyboard headset etc) will just stop working and I have to restart the pc every time.<br />
<br />
After having the problem for a few days I did a fully clean install but this didnt solve anything. I have been searching online but not many people appear to have had a similar problem from what I could find at least. I am pretty good with tech and have tried
 anything I could think of. I can confirm its not a power issue (ie the pc turning ports off the save power). I have also tried reinstalling all USB hubs but that didnt work either.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of the motherboard and serial number if it helps<br />
https://gyazo.com/a3a9c0f8a86e638ecf82159bc319916f<br />

Thanks in advance for any assistance

            When carrying out these instructions I found my windows 10 computer would hang (USB devices stopped working and computer would say it was uninstalling but never to completion) when I tried to uninstall the USB hubs. My solution to the original problem
 is to have a ps2 keyboard plugged in for when the USB devices stopped working (is every 3-4 days) do I could save my work before a restart.

    <title>Laptop stuck in windows rollback mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lionelrumpf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop stuck in windows rollback mode</h2>
                    So I scheduled the latest windows 10 update (version 1709 I think) and when I came back 2 hours later I was asked to choose a keyboard, so I selected the one I am used to and then after that the "choose an option" screen appears with the following options:
 1)continue-exit and continue to windows rollback, 2)change the operating system, 3)troubleshoot, 4)shut down your PC. if I click the first option, my computer restarts and shows the keyboard selection screen again. Choosing other operating systems also gives
 the same result. Also, none of the troubleshoot options work, as I don't have any backup file and other options don't do anything. I cannot access my desktop or any of my data. I obviously don't want to loose these files. Is there a way to recover my data
 and then do a clean install, or any way around this loop? Thanks for your help.

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unusual that the computer would shut down without showing a notification. Normally, when the time limit is reached, there will be a popup window stating the time is up and giving the option to either switch account or shut down the computer. I would
 suggest you to try removing and re-adding the child account and check if the issue persists. Refer the steps given in the help article below:</p>
<p>To remove a child account, go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=528556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>To add a child account, refer the help article below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/add-child-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add a child account to your family</a></strong></p>

</p><p>Get back to us with the result. We will be glad to help if you need further assistance.

On the receiving machine, Windows Media <strong>Center</strong> sees the picture, music and video libraries but not the recorded tv library.&nbsp; However, Windows Media

Any suggestions?<br />

                    I've just created an account with $16 in it, with automatic top-up, but my profile/options shows that I have credit of $1600!&nbsp; Why?
