<h2>            Internet provided by Apartment NAT problems</h2>
                    <p>I live in an apartment complex that provides internet to all the tenants via korcett/suddenlink. I have had problems with Strict NAT and even just being able to be in a party chat on my Xbox one. I did the port forwarding/triggering and that has given me the ability to party chat and play games with friends as long as the host has an Open NAT, but mine is still strict and prevents me from playing games with friends who have moderate NAT. I've talked with my ISP and they weren't any help besides just telling me to turn my Xbox off and on again. Is there any workaround I haven't been able to find yet?</p><p><br /></p><p>I have a wired connection through my router, plugging directly into the wall makes it impossible to do any port forwarding since I don't have access to the apartment building's network hardware.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks</p><p><br /></p><p>-Jake</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Yes that's how my Xbox was connected before, it resulted in a strict NAT type along with the inability to participate in party chat and join a game hosted by a friend with Open NAT. The result of running a multiplayer test was "Cannot get a Teredo IP."</p>

            <p>With your console directly connected to the network socket&nbsp;on your wall; does it obtain an IP address within any of the following ranges:</p><p><br /></p>
<p>10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255</p>
<p>172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255</p>
<p>192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Regarding the Teredo address; you would have to contact the personnel responsible for managing the networking equipment in your apartment complex and have them know about your situation.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Teredo tunnel uses&nbsp;port&nbsp;3544 over UDP.</p>
<p>To secure the tunnel; IPSec is being used, which negotiate IKE on UDP port 500. For IPSec NAT-T; port 4500 over UDP is being used.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>If there's an DHCP server on the other end of your network socket on the wall, then make sure they provide your console's IP as static, which should also match the very same address on your console, along with subnet mask and default gateway. Type of DNS server is often optional.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>You should be able to configure the RT-N10 as a wireless AP, without DHCP/NAT involvment, and with the LAN ports function as switchports, or access ports.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10, disable large application icon on most recently used file list</h2>
                    <p>The Windows update "Windows 10 version 1809 x64 2019-06C" (which I think is KB4023057) was recently automatically installed onto my machine. If I now open a program from the start menu, whereas before I would just see a list of recently opened files related
 to the application, now there is a horrendously large and pointless application icon showing above the list of files. Refer to the screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I disable this large icon from being displayed and get the recently opened files list showing how it used to show before the update was installed?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Account Management</h2>
                    <p>Good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased an Xbox 1 S console (previously owned PS3) and used my e-mail adress to create my microsoft account. My son requested that he be the "Main" profile on the new console so we set it up for him using MY mail adress. I then created a new secondary
 mail adress for myself in order to create my own profile. Now i want to know is, is it possible to manage the account so that i can use "MY" initial mail (the one my son is using) on my profile and to create a new mail adress for him. That being said, if this
 is possible and without either one of us losing our saved game data or having to start from scratch,&nbsp; can i share the Xbox live with him so that he can still play online?</p>
<p>

            For a second account you will need a new Microsoft Account (new email). Like was said above you can do account share to access all games and subscriptions from the another account, but to login with a different user you will need always a new microsoft
 account.

<p>First of all DO NOT use your email for your son's account!! This will lead to A LOT of trouble later, up to losing your account completely with all your email, One Drive content and other Microsoft Services!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is absolutely no reason to give a kid access to the adult parent account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to the Xbox One's Home Console sharing, you can do the purchasing with your own account, and share almost everything (Live memberships, game purchases, Game Pass Memberships) with the console, and everyone playing on that console will be able to benefit
 from that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your son can play with his own email on his own account, with your shared stuff on that console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are only very few things that can't be shared, and that are "consumables" (like virtual game currencies a la V-Bucks, Minecraft Coins and the likes), and some DLC expansion packs for some games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, as long as you both don't have much game progress on your "wrong way around" profiles, do the following:</p>
<p>Tell your son that he has to use his own account from now on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add your son's account to your parent account family. To do that, sign in on <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com/family</a></p>
<p>After you added your son to the family, you can go to <a href="https://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.xbox.com/settings</a> and set up the online and privacy settings for your son (for example you can set up time limits how long he can play, or allow him to talk to known people on his friend list ONLY, and prevent from making purchases on the
 store).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to the console and sign in with your parent account. Go to Settings, and under "Personalization" make sure that the console is your account's Home Console. That will share Memberships and Games to that console, so your son can play these with his
 own account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, if necessary set up a passkey on your account so your son can't (ab-)use your account.&nbsp;</p>

            To answer your question yes you can manage his account. If your the primary you can go to settings, Account, Family Settings then add him as a child. you can limit his screen time and put on a teen mode or if he is younger control what he sees. after that
 you can go to personalization under settings still go to My Home Xbox and make that Xbox your home one under your profile and you can now gameshare. I do have to warn you, I have 4 kids and when i created their child account it did cost me around 1.50 plus
 tax but its worth it. hope this helps.

<h2>            SSIS package configuration variable not found when running through a job scheduler. Runs fine locally from command window.</h2>
                    <p>I am running a ssis job which works fine locally on the app server but when run through a job scheduler it recieves variable not found even though the variable is set at system level. SSIS package has parent/child relationship and needs to pass the variable
 which has a value of location of config file. We have tried setting the variable through a wrapper script and setting it locally but none seems to be recognized. Any help is appreciated. The environment variable is set within the package configuration.</p>
<p>Variable example below.</p>
<p>SSIS_CONFIG= path/config filename</p>

<h2>            Windows10 has got REALLY slow&#33; Is it a virus&#63;</h2>
                    <p>hi.</p>
<p>I'm using windows10. my laptop is <strong>Acer aspire F5 573g 70mv</strong> with a<strong> 250gb Samsung EVO 850 SSD</strong> instead of it's own HDD hard drive.
</p>
<p>Despite all those, my system is really slow. it takes almost 10 seconds to boot. my RAM (which is 8gb ddr4) fills weirdly! especially when I use Photoshop (after I start it, 80% of RAM gets full! if it gets more than 95%, windows Fails!).
</p>
<p>when I start my task manager, At the very first moment CPU is 70% full but after few seconds it reduces to 5 to 10 percent! my disk (when it was HDD) was always more than 70% (and mostly 99%!) full!</p>
<p>All my friends suggested that my Laptop has some nasty viruses. so I scanned my PC with Windows Defender and it found nothing. I Scanned few times with Kaspersky and Avira (free version) and they found nothing too.
</p>
<p>I don't download Suspicious files but<strong> I use BitTorrent very much</strong>. can I get some Viruses with Torrent files? and Windows could not be able to find them in the first place?
</p>
<p>How can I know what's wrong or "Is something Wrong?" !!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS</strong>: the only reason that I believe something is wrong is that I believe my Laptop can work FASTER than it is now. I've tried CC cleaner but it didn't work that much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. Since you continue to experience the issue after following the troubleshooting steps mentioned, we suggest that you adjust the page file size or virtual memory in Windows 10. Adjusting the page file size is known for regulating
 the disk usage and it dramatically improves Windows 10 performance for machines that are using SSD type of hard drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box, type <strong>Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. </li><li>Go to <strong>Advanced </strong>tab and click <strong>Change...</strong> button in the
<strong>Virtual memory</strong> section. </li><li>At the top, uncheck the box right next to the <strong>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</strong> option.</li><li>Select drive C: <em>(or the drive where Windows 10 is installed)</em>.</li><li>Select <strong>Custom size:</strong> by ticking its radio button, and change the
<strong>Initial size (MB)</strong> and <strong>Maximum size (MB)</strong> to the <strong>
Recommended </strong>value that you will find just below the <strong>Total paging file size for all drivers</strong> section.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This method will help improve the system performance of Windows 10, and will gradually decrease the freeze issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

<h3> nathan-rowe1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update Constantly Failing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My computer is quite new and I've had this issue for quite a while, I'm not sure if it is my problem or if it is a Microsoft problem, I've tried finding fixes for it online and really none of them helped but the weirdest thing is that there is only one update
 that has the issue and that is "2017-09 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4038782)". It gets even weirder as there is no error message when it fails to install Windows Update just attempts to install it again and fails.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want this to be fixed because it keeps coming up with "Restart Now" and no matter what I do it just keeps failing and saying "Undoing Changes"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

<p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several <strong>ways to troubleshoot issues with installing updates in Windows 10</strong>. One of those is to
<strong>run the Windows Update troubleshooter</strong>. To do this, simply <strong>
download </strong>the tool by clicking on this <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_wu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you run the troubleshooter, just <strong>follow the instructions</strong> on the pop-up window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, please let us know.</p>
        </p>

<p>I tried exactly what you said and restarted my computer, as usual it attempted to install the updates and when I got to my desktop a message appears saying "Failed to install updates" and as expected I look at the history and it says</p>
<p>
</p><p>"2017-09 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4038782
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Failed to install "</p>
<p>
</p><p>and now it also says&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>" Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703</p>
<p>&nbsp;Failed to install "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unsure why this is happening but this has become a really big inconvenience&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can try to resolve the issue by following the steps below. Check if the issue is resolved after every step:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Uninstall the fingerprint reader from device manager and also check the box to delete the driver. Restart computer and let Windows install the driver automatically.</li><li>Remove all the OEM applications that is associated with fingerprint reader.</li><li>Delete or rename all the [GUID].DAT files in C:\Windows\System32\WinBioDatabase .</li><li>If the issue still persists, download and create a new bootable media for the appropriate version of Windows 10 from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 and perform a clean installation. You will need to delete all the HDD partitions
 and format them.</li></ol>

<p>I've had the same issue with a freshly installed Windows 10 on a Dell Latitude 6430u. I've tried all solutions I could find, but the only one that gave me success was to find and install a new driver for my Authentec AES2810 Fingerprint Sensor. The Dell
 version was 3.2.4 from 2012. After some searching I found a 3.4.4.84 version (also 2012). This driver is also a WinBio Framework driver and guess what. IT WORKED!!! No more "Already in use...."-messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it will resolve issues related to your message.</p>

</p><p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

    <title>Some questions after installing Samsung 850 EVO SSD. What do I do now - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Some questions after installing Samsung 850 EVO SSD. What do I do now &#63; Is that working propertly &#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello, I just installed my new Samsung 850 EVO SSD 250 GB.</p>
<p>I had a few problems with Samsung Magician Software when transferring the data, but managed to get to the confirmation that my HDD was cloned into my SSD by running Magician as Admin and removing firewalls.</p>
<p>I also changed the boot order to have SSD first, HDD second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few questions :</p>
<p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; how do I know that my PC is actually booting from the SSD ? I had the impression that I still listened to the HDD, and saw the orange HDD light blinking. On the other hand, when I go to Explorer, my SSD is labeled C, and when I am on my desktop, right
 click on an icon, Properties, the path shown is C, so looks OK ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I used Samsung Magician to perform a benchmark test : I get Read and Write of around 260 MB, vs 30 for my HDD, so a big improvement, but far from the 540 MB promised. Is that because my PC is 3-4 years old ? -e.g. I do not have USB 3 on that PC-</p>
<p>Anything easy I can do to improve that ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, when I go to Explorer now, C is my SSD, H is my HDD, but there is a F drive called System of around 30 GB which is about the size of Windows on my HDD. What is this F ? a partition of my SSD ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, shall I reformat my HDD since it is cloned on SSD ? Otherwise, how do I remove Windows from HDD since it's on SSD ?</p>
<p>Also, I'd rather leave Windows. Old on the HDD, and remove it for SSD. Can I do this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
</div>
<div>how can I remove windows and windows old from HDD ?</div>

            <p>I went to Windows Disk Management, and I see the following :</p>
<p>
</p><p>* the SYSTEM drive is 100&nbsp;MB, not 100 GB, and it's&nbsp;actually&nbsp;on my HDD, not on the SSD</p>
<p>* similarly, a 100 MB partition has been created on the SSD, called Data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that normal ?</p>

    <title>Another Surface Pro 4 bulging battery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leomorozovskiy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Another Surface Pro 4 bulging battery</h2>
                    <p>Like so many others here, my Surface Pro 4 battery has started to swell. This computer isn't even 3 years old as it was a warranty replacement for my purchased unit, as that one had WiFi issues that were never identified. My battery life has predictably
 become very poor, and my screen now shows yellow blotches on the sides and a white mark in the middle where the battery is swelling the most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the support desk at the Microsoft store and was told that since my computer is out of warranty the only option was purchasing an out-of-warranty replacement for $450, which would only have 90 days of warranty coverage. This is after the technician
 told me that my current computer isn't safe to use anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's frankly disappointing to purchase a premium product and not have it last even three years before it's toast. I've had many cheaper computers that have lasted longer. Not what I expected from this product and company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone's had any success either getting a replacement unit or even getting the battery replaced I'd love to hear it. As it stands it'd be very hard for me to buy another Microsoft product or recommend it to anyone else. Shame as prior to the battery issue
 it was a really nice machine.</p>

            Thanks for that info. I did reach out to support and I got nowhere - apparently my purchase was in December 2015 (even though my current machine is a warranty replacement and less than 3 years old). I'm not certain whether there's anything else I can do
 but obviously this will be my last purchase of a Microsoft computer. A machine like this which is basically not reparable needs to have amazing support behind it - I'm looking at Apple and their recent recall of power adapters from 2015.

It appears that the problem with contacting the update servers has been resolved. You should be getting your guide now.

            This happens because you cannot move a Windows 7 hard disk from one machine to another. If you're lucky then the disk will still work on your HP machine. If you're unlucky then the failed startup process has damaged your Windows installation.

<p><strong>I upgraded my windows vista to windows 7. Everything was fine I found that connecting to the internet was easy and trouble free. Recently my computer has become slower and probably ridden with malware and the like. So I formatted my entire hard drive
 and reinstalled windows 7. This was unproblematic however when I tried to access my LAN so I can connect to the internet it asks for a network key, when I input the key however it states that it is incorrect; I have checked the key and can state that it is
 correct.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have tried WEP wpa wpa2 all to no avail. I am only able to access the internet by having no protection, which isn't ideal. I have searched for this problem and have found others with the same issue but no definitive solution.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Try pressing the default reset button on your router, then access the router by way of a cable and set it up, you will need the default password and login, you did keep both in a safe place, did you not? If you did not go to the manufacturers website to
 get.</p>

<p>'How to backup' is a huge topic that's discussed in depth on the internet, but I'll give an outline of it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two types of backup: a file and folder backup and an image. A file and folder backup will backup individual files and folders that you specify. That's a good choice for backing up your personal files (documents, pictures, music, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>An image backup copies your entire hard drive from beginning to end. That's what you do to backup Windows and all your software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third-party backup software is the best way to backup. It will help you choose what to backup and it will run your backups automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's lots more detail and it's all on the internet. Take your time, learn how to do it the right way, and you'll never again worry about losing anything on your computer.</p>
