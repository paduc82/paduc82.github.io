<h2>            Recover Xbox gamertag with forgotten email</h2>
                    <p>Iâ€™ve searched for hours on end and all Iâ€™ve been told is that I need to call Microsoft to try and fix this, which is hard for me to do.</p><p>Iâ€™ve made quite a few gamer tags over the years Iâ€™ve played Xbox, for free trials etc, most of these I remember the emails for but only being able to link one account to an email, I had to create some email accounts to make a new gamertag. Iâ€™ve done this for an account which Iâ€™ve then played for a while, and bought DLC packages for games. Now Iâ€™ve gone through a few Xbox consoles over the years also, and canâ€™t remember exactly which account I bought the DLC on, I know the accounts it could be, and I can give the name on the card and the other purchase information for the account. I just donâ€™t remember the email address.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any help would be really appreciated</p>

            <p>Only people that can help you is xbox support by contacting them through support.xbox.com/contact-us they do have a chat area that can help you if you cant call you can give them your gamer tag information and look your account up with that information they can also search with any payment option information and look up any account that has that payment option currently actively on it (i believe only phone support can look up the info with the payment option though not chat support) when they find the information and can verify ownership of the account then they can see what game/DLC licenses are on your account and give you the email address associated with the account also. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 &#38; Microsoft Money 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; Microsoft Money 2003</h2>
                    MS Money 2003 installed and worked great in Windows 8.1. When the computer was upgraded to Windows 10, it does not work nor does it allow me to reinstall the program. Before I upgraded Microsoft indicated that all the programs and computer&nbsp;were compatible.
 Is there a solution to this? Thanks.&nbsp;

            I too have used MS Money 2003 for years and most recently in Windows 7. I have upgraded to Windows 10 and I can no longer use the program! What's up with that? Microsoft Money program response is "Money requires Internet Explorer 6 to function properly.
 Please reinstall Internet Explorer 6 so these components can be added." Is there a work around solution for this problem as I use Money all the time for all my banking needs.

            Normally, I would not be upset that a 13 year old program no longer works. But, this is a program
 8.1 to balance my checkbook one last time before I was forced to purchase a similar program. I did not have any problems with Win 8.1...but then I did not have any problems with Windows 3.11! Suppose one has to move ahead. All my other programs work flawlessly.
 Oh well!!!&nbsp;

            <p>I've managed to find a fix after hours of searching!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to update an Internet Explorer record in the Windows Registry in order to run Microsoft Money 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll assume that you're a novice (No Offence Intended) and guide you through the steps, one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We'll need to open the registry editor, to do this you'll need to search for 'regedit', this can be achieved in the Windows 10 search.</p>
<p>2. Once open, you'll need to navigate your way through the registry, following the below path.</p>
<p>[Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer]</p>
<p>3. Click once on the Internet Explorer folder and you'll see a list of items on the right.</p>
<p>4. Change 'Version' so that the last digit is a zero.</p>
<p>For example, my current version number is [9.11.10240.16384], I simply changed it to [9.11.10240.0].</p>
<p>5. Once saved, you'll need to restart your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this point on you should be able to run Microsoft Money 2003 with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you require any further assistance.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem as I was using the 2003 version on windows 7.&nbsp; After my update I had to revert back to windows 7 to restore all my money data and info. All this about changing registry entries etc. is not for me as I use computers but don`t program
 them.</p>
<p>What I did was get up to date and put all my info&nbsp;into excel work linking my data on work books and sheets. I consider my faux pas as a wake up call as in the ever changing computer world we can`t have progress without some upset.</p>
<p>I feel that it was my laziness that made me hold on to a very simple system instead of using a system which will be</p>
<p>probably be available in some form or other for a very long time.</p>
<p>After linking data on these sheets I found that excel could provide most of what money provided.</p>
<p>I have many daily transactions and accounts but with some effort I am happy with the result and believe you me I</p>
<p>am no spring chicken so age is not a problem.</p>
<p>I don`t want to miss out on all the new ideas in windows 10 and so I am now in the process of downloading it for the second time in a few days.</p>
<p>We must keep up with change&nbsp; and accept that nothing stays the same.</p>

            <p>Hi LesShort,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:<span>&nbsp;
</span></b>Try to install the program as administrator -Right click on the program installation files and select
<b>run as administrator, click</b> on <b>continue </b>if prompted for confirmation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>Disable the security software; follow the steps mentioned in the link below<br />

</p>
<p>If you are using non Microsoft security software,
<span>you may want to check the documentation that came along with the program to accomplish this.</span><br />

<b>Important:</b> Re<b>-</b>enable the security software once everything is done.</p>

            <p>It doesn't seem as the issue is with Microsoft but with Skype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at the information from Walter the traveler on Skype: <br />
<strong>System Update</strong> A small number of Skype customers are experiencing difficulties using Skype. For more on system status and solutions,<a href="http://heartbeat.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">visit Skype Heartbeat</a>.</p>

<p><strong>INTERNET phone service Skype says a small percentage of its 170 million users have been unable to sign in to its service, a problem that it expects to fix with a software update.</strong></p>
<p>Skype said on its website the trouble stemmed from corrupted data affecting computers using Windows, Linux or Macintosh operating systems.<br />

            <p>As I said in the original post, I have tried using microsoft fix it to solve the problem. It did not detect any problems with my drive but the files still would not be burned.</p>
<p>Also, for your method 1 and 2, I believe they are in fact the same programme.</p>
<p>I tried updating the driver but my driver is apparantly the latest one so I cannot solve the problem this way.</p>

    <title>Xbox one headset&#40;Chat&#41; is a poor design - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anyolname  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one headset&#40;Chat&#41; is a poor design</h2>
                    
<p>I am a day one purchaser of the XB1. This, after being an Xbox 360 owner from just about the beginning too. I loved my wireless over the ear mic from the 360, and I miss it. Why we took a step backwards with a wired headset connected to my controller, I'll
 never know...</p>
<p>But I'm not here to talk about that, I have other issues to discuss. The XB1 Chat headset is a poor design and breaks(Fails) too easily. Like I said earlier, I was a day one purchaser of the X1. As of this post I will be on my 4th headset(VS the two wireless
 ones from my 360, the second of which I still have and works). All of them failed with similar issues. Where the wire meets the base of the controls for the volume, where it bends up or down, seems to fail. It doesn't break off; to me it seems the wires inside
 become detached or break. What happens is that I loose sound or the microphone doesn't work at times. If you wiggle the wire up and down you can sometimes restore it, of if you hold the wire in a certain way, it restores function. But in general, I have to
 replace the headset about every 6 months(I'm really not a heavy player either). It's the part that takes the most "Abuse". It's constantly banding as the player moves and it is the point of stress if you drop the controller and it dangles by the cord. It would
 seem a simple fix would be to add a few cents to the cost and reinforce that point with a stronger flexible plastic that can handle the daily grind.</p>
<p>I originally purchased my first two headsets from Best buy, but they would not warranty the 1st head set because it came with the console...and said I would have to return everything to warranty just the headset. So I bought one. When that failed, I went
 to the Microsoft store. They took pity on me and gave me a 50% discount(even though they didn't have too) after they heard my issues. Now I'm looking for my 4th.</p>
<p>Now many of you are saying; "Take it back to the store under warranty". That's the second issue, there are none around for hundreds of miles. I live near Buffalo/Niagara Falls NY, so I'm not out in a rural area. Both checking online and physically calling
 stores(as of this post) Walmart, Target, Best Buy and the Microsoft store are all out of stock. If I wait three days, Best Buy can get one to the store for me with free shipping. I can get a used one from Gamestop, but who know what that went through or how
 long it will last. That leads me to think that I am not the only one having issues; or there is a redesign on the way. I'm hoping for the later.</p>
<p>So has anyone else had issues with their wired "Wireless" controller or is it just me?</p>

<p>That sucks man. &nbsp;I have had none of those issues. &nbsp;My chat headset is used almost daily too. &nbsp;Could you possibly be unplugging it by pulling on the wire? &nbsp;That would certainly cause the wires to become loose.</p>

<p>1)After the first two headsets, I purchased a charger(Energizer) that didn't require me to remove the controls to recharge it. So it stays connected all the time.</p>
<p>2) I though about the stereo headsets, even the after market ones. I may be a little old fashioned, but I think that's a little "Rude". It's bad enough that I get into my games, but add in a noise cancelling stereo headset and I would never hear what anyone
 is saying to me or whats going on in my house...</p>

<p>I tell you how much better the headset of the xbox one is compared to the 360 so read this:
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The 360 had a only a lil plug in which ended with a broken cord and cracking noises.
</p>
<p>The Xbox One headset got a big plug in that prevents this while playing games.</p>
<p>If used right there will be no issue you can even jump around and dance and your headset stays connected.</p>
<p>The issues happen when you put the headset away twist it and pull on the cord instead of the end of it.</p>
<p>Same with unplugging you cant pull on a cord but people do this. </p>
<p>Sometimes their kids do it or anyone else. </p>
<p>This is a user problem, use it right or left but dont use it wrong. </p>
<p>The plastic on the top is also way better then the 360. </p>
<p>There are people who dont want so much pressure on the head.</p>
<p>Those can keep the headset loose on their head and the design will keep it on the head.</p>
<p>This might be interesting to use if you have headaches and still wanna play games to relax.</p>
<p>You do not need to push it all the way close to your head. </p>
<p>I made use of that for a long time. </p>
<p>Even the cord is so bendable it cant distract you from gaming and the voice stays clean.
</p>
<p>Okay thats all (; </p>

    <title>Having trouble removing Business Contact Manager from Outlook 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Having trouble removing Business Contact Manager from Outlook 2007</h2>
                    New computer Dell Vostro 1720 - Windows 7 Ultimate - Office Small Business Edition<br />
Pre-loaded Outlook 2007 came with Business Contact Manager<br />
BCM wants to install every time outlook starts.<br />
Windows help says remove the program using control panel add/remove programs.<br />
No such luck, error message simply says failed to uninstall.<br />
Fine.<br />
Went into outlook to disable the program without uninstalling, SURPRISE program has to be installed first.<br />
Fine.<br />
Told the installer to go ahead and install the damn thing, just so I can disable it.<br />
Error msg, "prerequisite files are missing"<br />
Tried to uninstall from the OEM CD, same problem.<br />
Tried to re-install from the CD, same problem.<br />
Called Dell, no help. Told me to contact Microsoft.,<br />
Getting angry. <br />
Called Microsoft, less help. Actually asked for money up front.<br />
REALLY ANGRY.<br />
<br />
Calmed down and hit the forums.<br />
Now, I have BCM trying to install every time I open my OEM copy of Outlook 2007 that won't install, won't un-install, Can't be disabled, and is damn near impossible to find in the registry.
<br />
<br />
Anybody out there with some experience dealing with this problem?

            Thanks for your reply. I have never overclocked on this laptop so I dont think that will be the issue. I have run the Driver Verifier and after the reset it went into a BSOD loop with Intelpcc.sys as the detected violation. However, there were no dmp files
 created. I will run the Memtest tonight and I should probably have results later or in the morning.&nbsp;

                    Permission to access?&nbsp; You are subscribed to this thread<br />
When I try to access a file on my wife's computer (a simple home network) I get the following error message:<br />
<br />
Network error<br />
<br />
Windows cannot access \\Johnson\\Users\\public<br />
<br />
You do not have permission to access \\Johnson\\Users\\public.&nbsp; Contact your network administrator to request access."<br />
<br />
Neither one us knows what this means.&nbsp; How do I get permission?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance... Bob

                    I am a drummer who recently purchased M-audio's Fast Track Ultra 8R, plus a new Dell Studio XPS Windows 7 Pro (with XP mode) 4GB (2GB allocated to XP) 500GB i5 notebook. I also bought RED5 microphone bundles (8 mikes total), so that I can record my drums

 studying music poduction. A colleague of mine who used to be a musician, presented me with the Pro Tools LE 8 as a gift to get me going. It took me 3 days to install the Fast Track successfully, and 1 day to install the Pro Tools. The problem is Pro Tools

            Hi TRSLO
<br />
<br />Please do not update at this time . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft have pulled that update, it is no longer available on the download page and has been removed from Windows Update, a bug was found in that update, where for some users, all the users files were deleted and were not recoverable. 
<br />
<br />So, until this bug is resolved, do not update until Microsoft resolves this bug . . .
<br />
<br />If you have already downloaded the 1809 ISO, please delete that and wait for the new version to be released . . .
<br />
<br />Keep an eye on the link below, when that reports that the October 2018 Update is available, click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1809

<p>Hi Santosh</p>
<p>I've tried all 4 methods with no luck.&nbsp; I believe the hardware is at fault for this one.&nbsp; I've tried it on multiple machines as well just to confirm it wasn't due to a single desktop.&nbsp; To answer your first 3 questions:</p>
<p>1. Happened from first installation</p>
<p>2. Was not working ever.</p>
<p>3. No changes.&nbsp; As mentioned, tried on multiple machines.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to the latest drivers for my motherboard here: http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4408#dl (<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 153, 1)">GA-Z77-HD3 (Intel Z77, 2xPCI-E, 6xSATA, 4xDDR3). The drivers I downloaded and installed were:
</span></span>Intel Management Engine Interface and Intel INF installation. After restart, I tried again but it still does not show a driver letter for the USB. There is a blue light to indicate the USB is plugged in and then it goes off and no reaction on
 screen. The add/remove hardware safely icon does show up in the tray.</p>

                    How do I know which windows features I can click on and off in control panel/program and features? Also why are some boxes blue and not checked?

            When a box is blue that means not all of the subfolders are checked. To view the subfolders, click the + next to a folder.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can turn any of the listed features on or off - but you will not be able to use a feature while it's turned off. Unless you need to turn a feature on or off, the settings can be left as they are.<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>To turn <span>Windows</span> features on or off, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Click the <span>Start</span> button, click <span>
Control Panel</span>, click <span>Programs</span>, and then click <span>
Turn <span>Windows</span> features on or off</span>.&nbsp;<span> If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></div>
</li><li>
<p>To turn a <span>Windows</span> feature on, select the check box next to the feature. To turn a
<span>Windows</span> feature off, clear the check box. Click
<span>OK</span>.</p>

<p><em>â€œIt is worth describing the details of removeÃ¢â‚¬Â since this too is a place where there are engineering and customer decisions to be made. Weâ€™ve already seen one decision which is to make sure we keep the features staged for future use so that a DVD is
 not required. A second decision is that we also continue to support the APIs available for features where these APIs are necessary to the functionality of Windows or where there are APIs that are used by developers that can be viewed as independent of the
 component. As many of you know these are often referred to as dependenciesÃ¢â‚¬Â and with Windows the dependencies can run both internal to Windows and external for ISVs.â€</em></p>

<h2>            Computer slowing down immensely after update</h2>
                    Around 31/05 i had to update my laptop to the new version of windows laptop was working fine before hand and perfectly capable of playing games like League of legends around 60+ fps however upon updating my computer has suddenly slowed down and reduced
 my gaming speed to around 11-15fps which is a massive difference.Its also affecting the overal general speed of other things aswell.I went into task manager to see if anything could be causing it there and now it seems google chrome is making several instances
 despite only one being actual on.Same with spotify and other settings.Why is this happening?&nbsp;

            I would recommend that you should consider rolling back 1803 to 1709 and defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further. (Roll back can be done only if you were upgraded during last 10 days i.e. you are within 10 days roll back window)
<br />
<br />Roll Back - Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Under Go back to previous version of Windows 10, Get Started &gt; Follow onscreen directions

            Hi Darryl
<br />
<br />Microsoft removed the ability to change individual fonts in the Windows uI a couple of years ago and replaced that with just one basic setting . .. 
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker:

                    <p><span>I am getting an error message "Failed to initialize Microsoft.Net Framework 4 or higher. Please try to reinstall it". If I go to "Turn windows features on or off"
 it shows NET framework 3.5. If I uncheck this I can't uninstall it and get error message"component store has been corrupted - error code 0x80073712". I have tried Microsoft troubleshooter and similar without success. Windows cumulative update 208-09 won't
 install - error message 0x80246010. This update is dated 25/09/18 and that is the date when the issues started. I can generally use computer but some things do not work eg left click on windows start.</span></p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<h2>            Black screen in Google when coming out of sleep mode</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;I do a lot of work on the internet, but when I step away from my computer now, if google is open and my computer goes into sleep mode, it goes to a black screen in google when it "wakes". &nbsp;The only thing I can do then is click
 the "x" to shut it down (the x is still visible) and I lose all the tabs I had open and any work I was doing. &nbsp;Is there some new setting I'm missing?

</p><p>Hello <em>Pavan</em>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my computers <em>some 6 to 12-hour a day</em>. But I am <em><strong>not </strong>
</em></p>
<p><em><strong>an expert</strong></em> when it comes to install new softwares or to repair
</p>
<p>some kind of problems that happen now and then ! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to answer your questions <em>the best I can </em>: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Â»</strong> I previously used <em>Windows 7</em>, then <em>8.1,</em> until I moved to
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Windows 10 </em>about a week ago. </p>
<p>Â» I think that I used a <em>Home version of Windows </em>(I received </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; an invitation from <em><strong>Microsoft </strong></em>to order the<em> free
</em>version 10 ). </p>
<p>Â»<em> Version 8.1</em> was <em>all in French</em>.&nbsp; <em>Version 10 </em>was&nbsp;<em>approx. 30 %
</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; in French</em> (all the basic commands and indications were &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>in English</em>). And <em>2 days ago </em>(I remember you that this new
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; version 10&nbsp;<em>has been installed for less than a week</em>), it all </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; became&nbsp;as <em>an&nbsp;English version</em>. </p>
<p>Â»&nbsp;I installed the <em>Version 10 software as I received it from </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Microsoft</strong>.</em> According to me, <em>everything was installed
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (no instructions were received asking us to install other </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; parts or to install a newer version of this version 10). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is <em>the kind of information </em>you requested. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THANKS</strong>&nbsp;<em>Pavan </em>for your help ! </p>

I'm having trouble typing and using the delete and backspace tabs.&nbsp; Also, my letters tend to post in different spaces in my writings.&nbsp; If I want to delete and push delete....the windows box comes up.&nbsp; Or sometimes everything I have typed disappears.

<p>Keyboard looks same to one plugged in, have tried connecting other&nbsp;keyboards and same problem persists - it is&nbsp;NOT a keyboard problem.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Updates not getting installed even after downloading in Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: HP Compaq nc6400 notebook pre-installed wih Windows 7 Ultimate !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft Community:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a complete uninstall of my platform Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit&nbsp;and reinstalled my platform.&nbsp; All of the Critical updates were installed prior to installing any software programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; After I installed my software programs, I have run every test possible,
 no problems are found with Windows update, memory, HDD, drivers and 100% clean of any malware or PUP's.&nbsp; Windows updates shows that I have important updates and six optional updates since November 09.&nbsp; The green stream is not frozen and is streaming, but I
 am not getting my downloads.&nbsp; My update settings are set to automatic updates.&nbsp; I have left the laptop on for two days and all I am getting is the green stream, but no download of my updates that Microsoft says is ready for download.&nbsp; I even installed a standalone
 downloader from Microsoft and still unable to download any of the updates.&nbsp; When Windows scans for updates same, green stream and for hours and hours and no results if I have updates or no updates are available for the laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please any one in the community have any suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I also ran all tools that run in CMD PROMPT, as administrator, including vipre&nbsp; and no errors are found).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Hi, Likhitha:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have windows 7 SP1 installed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I ran the Windows Troubleshooter for updates, maintenance, drivers etc. etc. I run all the download fix tools from Microsoft, I have run every standalone tool for malware, including all standalone tools that run in CMD Promt as Administrator, and know malware
 is found.&nbsp;&nbsp; I run disk checker to scan HDD and fix any errors, no errors are found.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This HP laptop already had a posting related to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; (My desktop received a free download July 29, to reserve my upgrade for Windows 10.&nbsp; Microsoft advised me the same day that I could download Windows 10 and all went well.&nbsp; My wife's
 desktop also has a valid Windows 7 Home Premium and she did not get any invitation to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Last week in November I used the Media Creation Tool and upgraded her desktop, all went well with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my HP laptop Compaq nc6400 the laptop is donated to me by HP here in Panama, because I am a volunteer medical doctor since 1967 world wide, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.&nbsp; My prior Toshiba laptop was blown up in Afghanistan.&nbsp; (My HP came
 pre installed with Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit.&nbsp; PLus I do not like HP, because HP comes with a lot of **** pre installed, and also tries to install their drivers).&nbsp; I can not complain being donated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In July 29,&nbsp;I ran a Microsoft validation tool and Microsoft said my platform # was valid. The # contains an OEM. Microsoft downloaded a free Microsoft Essentials software for anti virus to use.&nbsp; When I used the Media Creation tool and downloaded Windows
 10 Microsoft said my platform is not valid, please obtain a valid key.&nbsp; End results I had my software/hardware engineer reinstall Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit with OEM #.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything that you have suggested and even more&nbsp; I performed.&nbsp; I am an expert in computers going all the way back to IBM, plus Yahoo considers me an expert, being I have the highest score on their ANSWERS VOTED AS HAVING THE BEST ANSERS TO RESOLVE TECHNICAL
 SUPPORT QUESTION BY OTHER USERS.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem now is that no matter what I do, after I was able to update my critical updates, about 75 downloaded prior to installing my software on my laptop with Windows&nbsp;7 Ultimate 64 bit.&nbsp; I leave the laptop on for many days and all I see is the GREEN SCAN
 RUNNING FOR UPDATES THAT I HAVE WAITING TO BE DOWNLOADED, AND THE UPDATES WILL NOT DOWNLOAD.&nbsp; I have run every test and tool and know errors or problems are found to resolve this issue.&nbsp; I can not download Windows 10 because the platform key is OEM, pre installed.&nbsp;
 I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit installed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run out of ideas, as how to get the downloads that are waiting to be downloaded from Microsoft and the green scanner runs for days. The green scanner is not frozen.&nbsp; I even installed a MICROSOFT STAND ALONE SCANNER FOR UPDATES AND THE SCANNERS RUNS
 FOR DAYS, AND DOES NOT DOWNLOAD THE UPDATES OR EVEN FINDS UPDATES FOR MY LAPTOP WITH WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE 64 BIT.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please this is my primary problem that I need support to help me resolve.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dr. Hubert Hechabarria</p>

            Additional Information:&nbsp; I have used Microsoft standalone installer, and the same problems continues, scan my computer for hours and hours never ending.&nbsp; I have even used the tool, WUESOFFLINE 1021, install via CMD PROMPT. Still my download that are ready
 for download were not installed.&nbsp; My Microsoft updates are set for AUTOMATIC UPDATES.&nbsp; Downloads are now waiting four days.&nbsp; (I updated every driver that needed to be updated via Microsoft Update Drivers.&nbsp; Still that did not help.&nbsp; The Microsoft troubleshooter
 fails to troubleshoot, because all I see is the troubleshooter searching hours for updates, instead of finding any&nbsp;problems to fix, if&nbsp;there&nbsp;are problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; (All this is happening with a clean install of Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit).&nbsp; I searched the world wide
 web and used every tool available, related to updates&nbsp;not downloading and nothing resolves this problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Driver Updates were performed via DEVICE MANAGE

            <p>After performing a clean install on November 09, I was able to install 77 important updates.&nbsp; After installing the updates, Microsoft updates stated that I had 199 important updates and 8 optional updates.&nbsp; These 199 important updates, with the 8 optional
 updates have been sitting ready for download, but the green scanner continued to run for days and ever downloaded the updates. I have my updates set for automatic downloads.&nbsp; I expertise goes all the way back to IBM, and I have used every Microsoft tool, every
 third party tool for repair and standalone malware and all these tools found no problems with my Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. or my computer system.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no words to describe how much I hate HP, because I have never used any computer that performs as
 strange as HP. (Can not complain to HP, being that the laptop is donated).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Six day and unable to download 199 important updates, plus 8 optional updates.&nbsp;The problem is resolved, but there is no technical logic as to how I was able to get the downloads.&nbsp; I ran a standalone malware tool that I failed to&nbsp;run with all others&nbsp;from&nbsp;Moscow
 and came up 100% clean.&nbsp; I removed Windows Updates from the START, to the&nbsp;desktop.&nbsp; I opened Windows Update from the desktop and still no downloads after about 30&nbsp;minutes.&nbsp; I have 5mega of speed from&nbsp;Cable &amp; Wireless.&nbsp; By some odd chance I opened the triangle,
 next to the action center flag in the tray and was shocked to see in the open customize box was an icon that neither open or closed, but showed Windows Updates in "%", downloading.&nbsp; Not even my Band Width Monitor showed any kb., or mega bites in green downloading,
 as&nbsp;performs for all other downloads.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After about one hour all off the 199 important downloads showed in the tray but still not on the monitor where I now have Windows Updates.&nbsp; (Still shows green bar moving, but zero&nbsp;% download).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon completion and three configurations my&nbsp;HP laptop now has the 199 important updates installed..&nbsp; Fear&nbsp;trying the optional updates,&nbsp;not knowing what to expect, when there is no known technical logic for the original problem that took six days to resolve
 with unknown logic.&nbsp; Going back to IBM, I have always said that there are strange things that computers do, like having a mind of their own, or having a GHOST inside of your computer taking control.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the first support, all the suggestion mentioned were already performed by me.&nbsp; I guess we can say problem resolved by unknown actions that have no logic.&nbsp; Close Ticket.
