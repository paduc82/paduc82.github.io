<h2>            Xbox One &#47; Titanfall random lag spikes&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone, &nbsp;Lately every time I play titanfall at least once during a two hour game session I will get a HUGE lag spike. &nbsp;It lasts from 30 seconds to a minute and I have really no control of my character during this time. &nbsp;Usually
 when it ends im dead. &nbsp;Sometimes I can keep playing after and other times it completely disconnects me after. I normally have full 4 bar connection ping, NAT is Open, All recommended ports are forwarded. &nbsp;I'm not sure if it's only Titanfall or all games, since
 TF is really all I have played lately. &nbsp;Is this a known issue or do you have any suggestions for me?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believed it might be a server issue. And that falls to MS and not EA for ounes. So called phone support about this. They will iron it out very soon afther words. The number in the US and CANADA is 1-800-4MY-XBOX.</p>

<p>I get the exact same thing dude, and I was wondering the same thing. I thought it was my router for awhile, but I can stream HD content no problem and play any other game with little to no issues at all, so my guess is its a server issue. It runs good for
 the most part but after playing for awhile I'll start to experience random lag spikes that last for a few seconds and then correct itself. Very weird and frustrating I know, but its not just you. I'm hoping a patch of some kind fixes this.

    <title>Account Suspension - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d2a2n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Suspension</h2>
                    
<p>I logged on this morning and noticed my account was suspended because payment issues. I use a debit card to pay for my Xbox membership and I do understand why I am suspended, because there WAS no money in my account. I have recently put some money into my
 account to be able to continue a membership, but I'm confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sign in to my suspended account, and my account shows my profile still being gold but not being able to access online services such as multiplayer games. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I have money in my account, does Xbox just continue to take
 from it as of now knowing I have money? Or do I buy a membership online?</p>

<p>xxzombies923 - First up you can't call people out on the forums as they're not in a position to defend themselves and you could be making this up for all we know. Secondly he's talking rubbish, unless you gave him your log in details he can't take control
 of your account no matter what he tries. File a complaint, set him to avoid, block communications then watch account suspensions for his inevitable appearance.

            <p><span><span>Hi Sachin,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>From my experience, the command “Grant-CsDialPlan” is used for Skype for Business Server. Are you using Skype for Business on-premises or a pure online environment?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Besides, the script is used to assign a dial plan to one or more users or groups rather than setting location to Default. So, can you let me know your detailed requirement?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business and you are looking for Power Shell scripts, I suggest you post this question on our

    <title>How to show total Page File Space in System Information after changing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> douglasnigelb  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to show total Page File Space in System Information after changing Virtual Memory allocation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I believed I understood I could set up a page file.sys on any partition available in Windows, if I wished, for example to create more Virtual Memory or to move a Page File to a different drive.&nbsp;However the changes I make to my computer are not showing up
 in System Information, after a reboot - why is this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I successfully configured an internal auxiliary drive to take on a pagefile.sys when using the Advanced System Settings in System Properties of the Computer Folder. The Page File memory created on this auxiliary drive alone is equal to one and a half times
 the size of the computers physical memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had&nbsp;created a larger Page File on the auxiliary drive, I then decided to shrink the Page File on the Boot drive down to 300 MB. When I had done with making changes, I clicked on Set then OK and afterwards I rebooted the entire computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After rebooting the computer, I looked to check System Information for a Summary of the changes I had made to Page File Space and Virtual Memory and I was disappointed to see that the Page File on the auxiliary drive not show up. System Information had just
 recorded&nbsp;the 300 MB Page File Space in C:\pagefile.sys, and there is no record of the larger Page File I created on the auxiliary drive. How is this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I return to the Virtual Memory Window in the Advanced System Settings, it clearly show that I had changed the two Page Files. Yet in System Information only the boot drive's Page File shows. How is this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still use Internet Explorer with only 300 MB of Page File Space, and it does actually run quicker than with the default Virtual Memory allocation, however the system soon slows after opening about 5 instances of Internet Explorer, and the system starts
 requesting to close application windows down to save memory. So why does the System not switch to using the Page File on the auxiliary drive?</p>

            <p>I was successful, is there a specific issue you're trying to sort out?&nbsp;I would suggest:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disable AMD's graphics drivers.</p>
<p>If you've tried to install 10 already and get nothing but a blank screen, boot into safe mode, (F8 at boot)&nbsp;disable the AMD&nbsp;driver and reboot.
</p>
<p>2. Disable fastboot, at least until you're already up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those were the two big issues I ran into, if you have questions post them here and I'll get back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

    <title>Primary language not on language bar Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Primary language not on language bar Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>OS is Windows 10. Primary language is English (US) with International keyboard layout. Secondary languages are Hebrew and Greek. Keyboard shortcut for moving from one to another is Alt-Shift.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: The primary language does not appear on the language bar, so I cannot move to English by using Alt-Shift, or even by clicking on the language bar.</p>
<p>In the language setup, English is clearly present as the primary language at the top of the list and with the input method designated.</p>
<p>The only way I was able to type in this question was by installing a different English (English-UK), which was added to the bar and could then be selected.</p>

            To answer my own question, Windows 10 has a prejudice against the International keyboard layout. When I added another keyboard to English (US), English (US) was added to the language bar. Idiotic.<br />

            <p>Thanks, but that shortcut is only helpful if the language actually appears in the language bar. My problem was that my primary language did not appear in the language bar.</p>
<p>I will leave feedback as you suggest.</p>

            Hi Krisan09,
<br />
<br />Windows will be unable to recover that data, you will need to use a 3rd party utility to try to recover that data
<br />
<br />Try the free Recuva to see if it can bring that back for you . ..
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva/download</a>
<br />
<br />Please Note: if Recuva can find those files, recover them onto your Hard drive, not onto the flash drive - you may overwrite other files you need to recover!

    <title>Failed version 1809 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothybuell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed version 1809 update</h2>
                    <p>I’m running version 1803. Constantly getting errors and failures when auto update tries to install version 1809. Impossible to fix this – even clean install fails. I did some research and it is clear I’m not the only one with this issue
 – I’ve seen hundreds of complaints about problems with the 1809 update!</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>But when I look at the SSU packages, my current update installed version 1803 was released in February 2019, while the update version 1809 was released last December 2018. This makes no sense. Why would the auto
 update try to install an earlier update version – 1809 – over a more recent update version, i.e., 1803?
<span>&nbsp;</span>Unless your SSU info on the MS website has a really bad typo regarding the release date – but I would think something so obvious is unlikely…</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Unless your SSU info on the MS website has a really bad typo regarding the release date – but I would think something so obvious is unlikely…</p>
<p>Should I just turn off auto updates for a few months? I don’t want to waste anymore time on this.</p>

<br />
<br />If its custom built, what is the make and model of the motherboard.
<br />
<br />Have you checked the manufacturers website to determine compatibility?

            Hi TimothyBuell,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Auto update search the first release on a newer version so, if you check, you find that it is trying to download and install Windows 10 1809 as it was on December (first working version of Windows 1809). But your version is actually supported and updated, so you have Windows 10 1803 updated as February 2019. Once installed Windows 10 1809 as it was on December, the system will auto download and install all the updates released until now. That's way you see a difference in time when comparing 1803 to 1809.
<br />
<br />In order to install Windows 10 1809 on your device I would suggest you to follow this procedure:
<br />
<br />1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar
<br />2. Right click on  "Command Prompt"
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator"
<br />4. Type "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER
<br />
<br />Then:
<br />
<br />1. Open "File Explorer"
<br />2. Click on "This PC"
<br />3. Right click on "C:"
<br />4. Click on "Proprieties"
<br />5. Click on "Clean-up disk"
<br />6. Click on "Clean up system files"
<br />7. Select every option in the list, but not "Download"
<br />8. Click on "OK"
<br />
<br />Then:
<br />
<br />1. Type "Powershell" in Windows search bar
<br />2. Right click on "Powershell"
<br />3. Click on "Run as Administrator"
<br />4. Type :
<br />
<br /> "net stop wuauserv" without quotes and press ENTER.
<br /> "net stop cryptSvc" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net stop bits" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net stop msiserver" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net start wuauserv" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net start cryptSvc" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net start bits" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br /> "net start msiserver" without quotes  and press ENTER.
<br />
<br />At this point, search for updates in Windows Update and see if you can install Windows 10 1809.
<br />If also this fails, I suggest you to use Windows Update Assistant to update to the newer version of Windows 10. You can  download it from : <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=799445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=799445</a> then run and follow on screen instructions.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if that solves your problem or if you need more help.

<p>Thanks for taking the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried what you suggest -- since as I mentioned I wasn't the only one with this issue -- and after a bit of research I discovered many similar solutions. None worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, an MS support technician took over my machine remotely, and was kind enough to re- attempt not only your suggestion, but then proceeded to do all sorts of arcane shell commands -- stop/start bits, cryptSvc, etc, etc -- all of which had similarly futile
 outcomes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess what I was basically asking was about the apparent discrepancy in the release dates of the updates, and if I should even bother worrying about it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, here's what I'm going to do: back up files and important program stuff from C drive, and then forget about the whole 1809 debacle until the OS blows up or whatever. Then I'll format the C drive -- maybe even treat myself to a shiny, faster new one--&nbsp;
 and do a fresh install. I've had to do that before and it takes less than an hour (or maybe 2 hours if you include going to computer store for new drive). Way less time than typing all those shell command acronyms correctly and cleaning up your monitor after
 throwing your coffee cup in frustration. That would be my advice to the average user -- especially those who don't know a wauserv from a cryptSvc.<br />
</p>
<p>But I do appreciate your time and thoughtful reply.<br />

            You could also skip Windows 10 1809 altogether then wait until Windows 10 1903 is released in March.
<br />
<br />You could always backup your personal files then attempt a direct clean install:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-manually-backup-and-restore-your-files/45859954-c9c3-403f-b997-e96c8e001963">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p><span>Hi razheer,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Welcome to Windows Vista answers community.</span></p>
<p><span>It would be great if you can provide the answers to these questions in order to assist you better. Did you
 make any hardware or software changes recently? Does the Microphone if connected to any other USB port?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile you can try the following steps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Set your device in regular way.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click the icon of speaker at the right-bottom of your screen and choose recording devices.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click
<strong>Microphone</strong> in the window, and then click <strong>
Configure </strong>button.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click
<strong>Set up microphone</strong> in the next window, and follow the wizard to configure the device.</span></p>
<p><span>If above method fails, try to confirm items below:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>Audio Adaptor is drived properly:</span></strong><span>
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong> – Right click <strong>
Computer </strong>– <strong>Properties</strong> – <strong>Device Manager</strong>, make sure that every audio-related device is correctly drived without a yellow mark nearby. If so, reinstall the driver and try the method 1-3 again.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>
 Though every device may appear normal in Device Manager, it’s still recommended to reinstall the latest driver of Audio Adaptor.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>USB port works well:</span></strong><span> Connect other USB devices
 via the same USB port, or try other USB ports to connect the microphones. By this method, we can confirm the health of USB port.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>
 Install the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>Cumulative update rollup for USB core components in Windows Vista</span></span></span></a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span>
 Perform System restore to restore the system configuration to an earlier point in time when the microphone was working correctly. Ref:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</span></span></span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Hope these steps resolve the issue.<br />

            <p>Hey Furry. Any points earned in games are specific to that game. In Gears' case, you will gain XP points during matches that help level you up in that game. There is no conversion to MS points that happens. Items or XP earned in-game is specific to that game. The deal you mentioned where you got points for renewing seems to be because you are signed up for Xbox LIVE Rewards. I hope this clears things up, if not, let us know :)</p>

            Are you using it in desktop mode or in Wimdows app? Try opening IE in the start menu, not the desktop version, and see if it works in there. Is a keyboard connected?

    <title>Asks for password on System Restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon698  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asks for password on System Restore</h2>
                    I recently performed a "clean" install of Windows 7 on a 1 yr old Dell PC with Vista. Yesterday I did a System Restore to a point in the previous day but when the Restore completed it asked me for a password. I do not have an Administrative password and
 have never used a system password for any PC I ever had. I tried to leave the password "blank" but it was not accepted. I was completely locked out of my PC.
<br />
In desperation I inserted the Windows 7 install disk in the DVD drive, was able to boot to the disk setup and had no alternative but to perform a "clean" Windows 7 install again. After 6 hours of reinstalling programs and files I am up and running but unless
 I get satisfactory answers I will disable System Restore.<br />
Why do I need a password to perform a System Restore? This was never required in previous operating systems. Is the password different than the Adm Password I do not use? How do I find out the password the system is looking for? Where there other alternatives
 I could have used to get back into the system other than the one I chose?<br />
Any light you can shed on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,
                </div>

<p><span>Hi jon698,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You should be able to login to your user account after System Restore is completed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Possibly someone else would have created a password for&nbsp;your user&nbsp;account.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Windows wouldn’t create a password automatically after System Restore is completed.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you go ahead and enable System Restore on your computer, but if you are willing to leave it as such Windows 7 wouldn’t
 be able to recover your system using System Restore in case of system failure.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
Also, set a password for your User Account for safety and protection against external sources.<br />
<br />

                    <p>Добрый день, я к сожалению столкнулся с проблемой. Мой ребенок без моего ведома приобрел две игры:
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/store/p/minecraft-master-collection/9pmtbb8xs937/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Minecraft Master Collection</a> и</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/store/p/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy/c27xpr5xdmft/0001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Crash Bandicoot™ N. Sane Trilogy ,&nbsp;&nbsp; в июне и июле 2018г, но я&nbsp; это заметил только сейчас.
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Я все понимаю, что обращаюсь поздно, но все же прошу вернуть потраченные деньги, т.к. сама игра
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/store/p/minecraft-master-collection/9pmtbb8xs937/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Minecraft была куплена ранее, а </a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/store/p/minecraft-master-collection/9pmtbb8xs937/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Minecraft Master Collection это по сути одно и тоже только ребенок это не понял и купил, зачем
 дважды мне платить за одно и тоже.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>По второй игре я также не знал , что она была приобретена . Я еще раз прошу вернуть денежные средства, скрины прилагаться, в свою очередь гарантирую что подобного не повторится, сейчас установлю родительский контроль как мне посоветовали в службе поддержке.

</p><p>
</p><p>Good afternoon, I have unfortunately encountered a problem. My child has purchased two games without my knowledge: Minecraft Master Collection and</p>
<p>Crash Bandicoot™ N. Sane Trilogy, in June and July 2018g, but I noticed it just now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I all understand that I am addressing late, but still ask to return the money spent, because the game Minecraft was bought earlier, and Minecraft Master Collection is essentially one and also only a child is not understood and bought, to pay me twice for the
 same thing.</p>
<p>On the second game I also did not know that it was purchased. Once again I ask to return money, screenshots to be attached, in turn guarantee that such will not happen again, now I set parental control as I was advised in the service of support. My email
 address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p><span>Привет,</span><br />
<br />
<span>На этом форуме мы не можем помочь вам с этим вопросом.</span><br />
<span>Я рекомендую вам попробовать связаться со службой поддержки Microsoft / Xbox.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Но чтобы ваш ребенок не мог покупать игры без вашего уведомления, я рекомендую вам защитить эту опцию паролем (или кодом).</span></p>
<p><br />

<p>Добрый день! Уведомления о покупке приходят сразу после приобретения на почту аккаунта. И только некоторое время возможно запросить возврат средств из истории покупок.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Вам необходимо напрямую обратиться в <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/28808/microsoft-store-contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
техническую поддержку Microsoft</a>, но возврат мало вероятен. Так как прошли все сроки</p>
<p>Для ребенка создать отдельный<a href="https://support.xbox.com/ru-RU/xbox-one/security/core-family-safety-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> семейный аккаунт</a>, так вы сможете контролировать и покупки и время игры и контент, который ему доступен.</p>
<p>Удачи!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro Drivers.</h2>
                    I just got my old Windows 98 gaming computer back together for all of my old games, and I got the Flight Simulator '99 game at a garage sale recently. I dug out my old SideWinder in hopes that I could play the game. I've been wanting to play something
 on the old computer now for quite a while, but this driver issue is the only thing holding me back. All I need are the drivers for it. I can't seem to find them anywhere. The controller uses the old game port connection, in case that makes any difference.
 Can someone please give me a link to the drivers?

    <title>Xbox One Stereo Headset no sound out of right ear. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carbonite1983  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Stereo Headset no sound out of right ear.</h2>
                    
<p>So I have my stereo headset that is probably only a year and a half old. Its never been yanked out of the controller, it gets put on a table every time I'm done with it and all of a sudden the right ear cup is getting no sound. My controller is up to day,
 my batteries are fresh, I've tried to use it on my cell phone and I have the same result. I probably only use it 2 hours a week and I'm going to be more than a little disappointed if it truly is broke already. I didn't know if maybe there is an issue that
 creeps up on them that is easily fixable or not. Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about issue! Since you have already tried to use your headset with a different device and the issue continues to occur, you will need to have your headset replaced.

<p>I stopped by my computer shop.&nbsp; The tech hooked the notebook up using DSL.&nbsp; The IE opened slowly.&nbsp; He checked the ip config. Then rechecked IE.&nbsp; IE opened without any problems.&nbsp; He told me I could not use&nbsp;a wireless connection in the XP Mode because there
 is no driver for the wireless adapter in the XP Mode on the Dell website.</p>

 to provide at all. This is becoming a problem because the tech knowledge of my friends has been exhausted trying to locate it. Everything else is in place for the logs to be read with skype log reader, but the actual logs themselves are unable to be located
 by any of our searches through various sections of my computer. This includes the area,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">C:\Users\exampleusername\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.SkypeApp_kzf8qxf38zg5c...&nbsp;</span></p>

 considering it wasn't anything the log reader would accept, it also meant that it was a mess of code and text. Yikes.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi rad-lad-in-plaid
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. Some additional input -
<br />
<br />Q. I don't know where the newer versions of skype keep the log data in the form of the main.db file because it has been absolutely impossible to locate in any search so far.
<br />A. Unlike previous Skype, new Skype keeps all its data in Cloud. There is local storage like main.db which previously was.
