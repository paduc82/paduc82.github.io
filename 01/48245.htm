<p>Hello I'm french so I apologize for my poor English. There is a little over a year I was a hacker person I met on xbox live I call Microsoft directly to me said I was a hacker and I was doing "fishing "so I decided I'm doing myself and I create an account
 contact the hacker to find out if it was possible to recover my account against the money he accepted for 100 Euros I given via paypal he admitted later that he had changed some things on my account without telling me where provided. All his past was a few
 months ago but now my gamerscore is reset and my gamerzone is considered a "cheat" when I always paid my games and I have always been loyal to microsoft bought 3 consoles , 110 games, 15 collectors editions, 32 months xbox live gold, about 50,000 microsoft
 points spent, but today I've had enough, enough been regarded as what I am not, I'm tired of seeing my success to zero while I spent hours and hours to make certain, I decided that as your decision is I will sell all my equipment microsoft (console games at
 all) and I buy a PS3 I would be very grateful and I continue to play <span>

Anyway once a gamerscore is reset, it's reset for good. You're better off making a new account, play safe and keep your login details to yourself.</span></span></span></strong></p>

<h2>            NetBios name stuck on default after re-image</h2>
                    <p>I re-imaged Win10 yesterday in hopes of solving several nagging little problems. So far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default NetBios name the install assigned is meaningless (to me) so I want to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried what I think worked for me before, but it is stubbornly stuck on the default. I thought all I had to do was change the "Full computer name" and it would also become the NetBios name....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all <em>very</em> much!</p>

<h2>            Cortana can&#39;t find local music &#40;but it plays just fine in Groove Music&#41;</h2>
                    My Groove Music is successfully finding my local music on an external drive. But when I ask Cortana to play anything (as in "Play Reflection by Brian Eno" or "Play songs by Bruce Springsteen"), she says "Looks like you'll need a subscription to play [whatever]
 on Groove." Since they play just fine from the Groove Music app, how to get her to look there?

<li>Were you able to play local music before?</li><li>If yes, did you make any changes before the issue started?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done on your end?</li></ul>

            <p>I think I may have been able to play local music in the past. I had Groove Music watching the library on the external drive and updating from it. Groove Music plays the music now, but Cortana appears not to know that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only troubleshooting that I have done is playing the music via Groove Music to be sure that that worked, then repeatedly trying it through Cortana, which consistently didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(That's even when I got her to agree about what I was saying. The first few tries were along the lines of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me: Play Reflection by Brian Eno.</p>
<p>Text appearing in the field: Play Reflection by Bryan Adams.</p>
<p>Cortana: Looks like you'll need to subscribe to Groove to play Reflection by Christina Aguillera.</p>
<p>Me:&nbsp;<span>¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I've gotten her to recognize what I'm saying -- but not yet to play the music.)</p>

            <p>Joseph, can you try run SFC scan on your computer to check if there is a corrupted system file causing this issue. System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
 For more information, you can check the article below:</p>

            <p>Good question. I wish I had an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked Cortana "Which version of Windows 10 am I using?" Rather than answer the question, she did a Web search. I saw that I should look it up using the start menu -- but since I closed the Edge window, the Start Menu and Cortana have stopped responding
 to clicks or to pressing the Windows key.</p>

            <p>I tell Cortana to play artist xxxxxxx and it plays my iTunes music in Groove, which I wish I could change.&nbsp; But my music is on a local drive.&nbsp; Maybe you need to have some local player which has your music as a library folder.

<p>
</p><p>What do you mean by "so it shows in your Music folder"? Are you asking if I've done a symbolic link or the equivalent? Groove Music itself finds the music just fine, so Cortana, using Groove Music, should do so also, right?</p>

    <title>Problem with installing &#40;after update&#41; SKYPE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m&#225;ria ondrejkovi‰çov&#225;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with installing &#40;after update&#41; SKYPE</h2>
                    <p>Is there anybody who might have the same problem as myself?:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running W7 64 on my SONY VAIO.</p>
<p>Some time ago I have tried to run SKYPE as usual. A message saying something like: You can not sign in as your version of SKYPE is obsolete, download the new version. So I complied and downloaded the new setup. A few minutes after running this new setup
 a message appeared saying: Could not open the key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE32\Software\Microsoft\InternetExplorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_MAXCONNECTIONSPERSERVER. Error code 1603. (I am not an IT expert and can not understand why should I have a Key H_L_M32
 when I am running the W64?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly I have contacted the Microsoft support who tried to be extremely helpful, took over (with my consent) the control over my NB and attempted to rectify the fault - with no avail. In the end I was recommended to contact the manufacturer of my NB (SONY).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SONY VAIO support let me know that I should extend the number of connections for this key in the registry DB to 10 as the problem lies with the Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to locate such a key in my Registry DB with no avail - that key does exist there. When I reported this info to SONY support I was told to contact Microsoft as the problem has nothing to do with SONY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have looked for the Error 1603 and found an advice to download and run a repair program MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab and re-run the SKYPE setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did it all with the same result. When I have repeated the attempt to run the repair program the SKYPE dissapeared form the list of programs potentially having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful for any help as MS support failed to solve my problem.</p>

            <p>The problem you are experiencing is due to missing/corrupt data or permissions in your Windows registry.&nbsp;All the Skype installer attempts to do is access data that should be accessible to any&nbsp;Windows user account.&nbsp; When it cannot, this error is produced.&nbsp;
 The issue is technically not a Skype issue except that the Skype installer considers&nbsp;it a condition that will halt the install of Skype.&nbsp; To attempt to resolve the problem you can try my removal tool (SRT/SRTa).&nbsp; The latest version attempts to rectify this
 problem when a removal is run and it specifically&nbsp;runs across this problem.&nbsp; Hopefully it will work for you.</p>

<h2>            Tiles vs Desktop start up screen</h2>
                    What settings do I go to so that my Windows 10 tiles is my start mode instead of it going to the desktop all the time and then I have to pull up the tiles start screen with the Windows button?&nbsp; In Windows 8 if I wanted to go to the desktop, I'd hit the
 show desktop button, but now I automatically go to the desktop and the only time I get my tiles to show is specifically by hitting the Windows button on the taskbar by Cortana's search bar.

            Have you tried to change the setting for Start full screen in the main settings?
<br />
<br />click the Start button and then click the Settings command.
<br />At the Settings window, click the setting for Personalization.
<br />At the Personalization window, click the option for Start.
<br />In the right pane of the screen, you'll see a setting that says "Use Start full screen" that's currently turned off. Turn that setting on so the button turns blue and the setting says "On.
<br />Now click the Start button, and you should see the full Start screen.
<br />
<br />Or just turn on tablet mode and reboot .

<h2>            Microsoft solitaire collection spider stuck in one suit mode, can&#39;t change to 2 suits</h2>
                    &nbsp;I was so frustrated with Windows 8, I took my new computer&nbsp;back to Best Buy.&nbsp; They had no computers that they could sell me other than Macs that had anything else but Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; They sold me their Geek Squad package, restored my computer to its original&nbsp;
 condidtion.&nbsp; Reinstalled my software.&nbsp; So today I downloaded the Microsoft Solitaire Collection from their game apps.&nbsp; I got the same game with the same problems as before.&nbsp; Stuck in the one suit mode, never gives me an option to change to 2 or 4 suits.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Does show my&nbsp;statistics that I had&nbsp;before&nbsp;in the 2 suit mode.&nbsp; Must have something to do with xbox live which I am not interested in.&nbsp; I just want to relax with the spider that I have been playing for years.

    <title>System32 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aden859  say:</h3>
<h2>            System32</h2>
                    I have seen ALOT of system32 deleted videos. And I am asking you to ask Microsoft this, (I'm to shy): In the next update of Windows 10, or the next Windows OS, can Microsoft happen to not let users delete the file? I honestly think that it is stupid that
 people delete System32.<br />
Thank you.

            System32 is actually a folder underneath the Windows folder. Whatever, most people know enough not to play around with things they don't understand. But a minority think
<em>they</em> know better, which is how they end up here among the other losers who mess up their computers and blame it on Microsoft.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If your talking about your profile 4 digit passcode which you type in with the joystick combination, then that can be easily reset by simply deleting your profile and downloading it again.<br />
<br />
You can learn about how to delete and re-download your profile <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you are referring to the family settings passcode put on the console by yourself or someone else and you don't know the password to that, or the security reset questions then you'll need to contact phone support by clicking this link

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />This feature depends on your internet provider and of course the router you are using.
<br />
<br />You can try the following methods:
<br />
<br />-Enter the IP address 192.168.0.1 in your Internet browser.
<br />Use admin as the user name and password (or use your personal login).
<br />
<br />-Select the menu item Wireless, then select Radio in the 2.4GHz section.
<br />
<br />-In the top selection field, you can now activate 2.4GHz.
<br />
<br />-Then click Save.
<br />
<br />If you prefer answer who is your network provider and i try to help you.
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />Angel.

            Hi martinbarnes3,
<br />
<br />In the back or bottom of your Router is a sticker with a UserName, Password and IP address (something like 192.002.005.001) printed on it
<br />
<br />Note those down
<br />
<br />Go to your PC and open a Web Browser
<br />
<br />In the address type the IP address and hit Enter
<br />
<br />That will bring up your routers configuration page
<br />
<br />Somewhere on that page you will find settings
<br />
<br />In the settings menu, you will be able to switch from 5GHz to 2.4GHz
<br />
<br />Before you can change that, you will need to enter the UserName and Password you noted down from that sticker on the router
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>Hi Roystar,</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the error message or error code you get when you try to install the game?</p>
<p>This game is compatible with both versions of Windows (32-bit and 64-bit).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=MANHUNT&amp;v=Rockstar Games&amp;uid=&amp;pf=1&amp;pi=3&amp;s=Manhunt 2003&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Software&amp;p=MANHUNT&amp;v=Rockstar%20Games&amp;uid=&amp;pf=1&amp;pi=3&amp;s=Manhunt%202003&amp;os=64-bit</strong></a></p>
<p>Try uninstalling the game from Programs and Features and install the game once again and check.</p>
<p>You may try disabling User Account Control and check if you are able to install game.</p>
<p>Open User Account Control Settings by clicking the Start, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type uac, and then click Change User Account Control settings.</p>
<p>Check the link: <strong>What are User Account Control settings?:&nbsp; </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/What-are-User-Account-Control-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/What-are-User-Account-Control-settings</strong></a></p>
<p>If you are still unable to install the game, I would suggest that you contact the manufacturer of the game and check if there are any latest patches available for Windows 7.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you are able to run other games and the issue seems to be limited to just Manhunt you will need to pursue the support through RockStar games.&nbsp; One thing you can try is to do a&nbsp;<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean
 Boot</a></span>&nbsp;and see if it runs then.&nbsp; If it does then another piece of software is causing the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forums. As per the description, you need help in creating new user accounts in Skype.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Sorry, I followed the link you gave me, but I became more confused than before... You can,t use this option&nbsp; (using Microsoft account getting Skype) if you already use Microsoft account on w8.... or something similar.... listen, I just have no time to
 find out many new and useless things, asking my 80 years mother to create a Microsoft account, plus the neighbour sometimes, I'm very very upset, can't even do my job properly on this pc..... and I haven't spoken to my family in the last three weeks. Sorry
 to disturb you.

            <p>I just want to make it clear, what I don't understand: "This option is not available for Windows 8 accounts created with a Microsoft account" Probably because I'm not English, have no idea what that means :(</p>
<p>When I want to log in, I have to give my Microsoft account, no excuse. When I'm on Skype, I can't change anything.... I can't find the way, and when I find, I can't find the way back... :( :( :( I think I'm tired as well.&nbsp; :( :(</p>

                    <p>I got the Xbox game pass and my understanding was that I would be able to install and play any "Xbox play anywhere" game on my pc but I can only get like 10 games to give me the option.&nbsp;</p>

 it wont let me install. I don't have an Xbox and I don't have one since my pc blows consoles away. I was hoping game pass would allow me to play more titles on my pc. Are there really only like 10 games for PC or am I doing this wrong?&nbsp;</p>

            Do a search for just Halo Wars 2. In the results it should show "Halo Wars 2: Demo, Halo Wars 2, Halo Wars 2: Standard Edition" Try clicking the one in the middle and see if that one will start the install for you. I noticed if I choose the standard edition
 it wants to install on the console.&nbsp;

<h3> hanafubuku  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update stuck at 99&#37;</h2>
                    Left it on all night and it's still stuck at 99%. No failure messages. Some of the forums indicate to restart computer. Worried that upon restart, upgrade will no longer be possible since it is past 7/29. Should I just give up on Windows 10 or is there
 some sort of fix?

            <p>So let me see if I read this correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the upgrade process DID NOT complete the installation by midnight 7/29 the offer is expired regardless of how long this 'process' has already been running [if you could count staying at 99% for 22 hours now for me]. And in letting it continue to sit at
 99% after the deadline I am just making a fool of myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so glad that I've spent [read pizzed] the past sixty some hours trying to get this thing to work in vein. And the best thing anyone can say is to plead with Microsoft. Gerry, don't let anyone ever say you don't have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the cherry is all that time I couldn't get windows update to connect before I finally couldn't put off the upgrade. Day late and out the cash for the new ssd... joy.</p>

            <p>You have had had 12 months to decide whether to upgrade which gave you plenty of time to resolve any problems you might have upgrading. Problems other user users have had upgrading have been well publicised and reported so few would be unaware that they
 might have difficulties.</p>

            I contacted the link above on August 3rd. &nbsp;They found the problem was that my windows 7 computer had a bunch of security updates that were not installed. &nbsp;They remotely installed the updates and gave me a link to run the Windows 10 update again. &nbsp;Its in
 process now. &nbsp;Very pleasant and helpful.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I Have a windows 7 pro OS, I installed last batch of windows updates and rebooted.&nbsp; Logged in as user, installed the Web of trust add in for Windows Internet explorer; logged off and restarted.&nbsp; When the welcome screen came up, all that was showing was the

<p>I restarted in safe mode and i was able to sign in as the user was displayed.&nbsp; Does anyone have any idea what could have caused this.&nbsp; A corrupt registry key?</p>

<p>Hi jraesly,</p>
<p>Your Windows 7 question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on Technet.</p>
