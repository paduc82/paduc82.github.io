<h2>            bootrec &#47;rebuildbcd command returns 0 Windows installations found, Windows 10 laptop.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>This is on Windows 10.</p>
<p>My laptop wonâ€™t boot and Iâ€™ve tried auto repair with no success. &nbsp;Now Iâ€™m trying to repair my boot configuration following information from the internet and Iâ€™m running into a problem. &nbsp;So far Iâ€™ve been using the following commands with some success.</p>
</div>
<div>At a Command prompt.</div>
<div>1.<span> </span>bootrec /rebuildbcd</div>
<div>2.<span> </span>bcdedit /export c:\bcdbackup</div>
<div>3.<span> </span>attribute c:\boot\bcd -h -r -s</div>
<div>4.<span> </span>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</div>
<div>all of these commands return successful.</div>
<div>5.<span> </span>bootrec /rebuildbcd</div>
<div>Hereâ€™s where I run into the problem. &nbsp;It never finds a Windows installation and always returns 0.</div>
<div>My configuration looks something like this.</div>
<div>Volume<span> </span>### Ltr &nbsp; &nbsp; Label<span>

<div>Volume 5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RAW. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Partition. &nbsp;&nbsp;14GB. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Healthy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Iâ€™ve figured out Volume 1 is obviously my Windows Partition. &nbsp;Volume 4 is my USB Windows recovery drive Iâ€™m using. &nbsp;And I believe Volume 3 is my boot volume. &nbsp;Volume 2 or 5 must be the OEM recovery partitions which should actually be Windows 8 which is
 what originally came on this laptop. &nbsp;Iâ€™ve since upgraded to Windows 10 so they would technically be useless.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do know that my boot Volume is listed as hidden but I donâ€™t think that makes any difference as I think itâ€™s supposed to be that way. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My original question is, what can I do about bootrec /rebuildbcd always returning 0 Windows installations found? &nbsp;I have looked at the Windows folder on the C: drive and everything appears to be there and in order as far as I can tell but Iâ€™m far from
 an expert.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div>Ive also tried tried to access my backup registry stored in the registry backup folder but they all had a zero file size so that was a bust. &nbsp;Thankfully, the actual registry files have actual file sizes so they look to be okay as far as i can tell.</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

<p>Hi Tom. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
It explains what 0 installations found means in this tutorial: <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/rebuild-bcd-store-windows.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/...</a><br />
<br />
Remember in exporting the BCD to use the drive letter (or assign=[letter]) for the actual System partition where the boot folder is stored. In your case it may be the RAW ruined partition or it may be the 260mb FAT32 partition.
<br />
<br />
Everything else possible to get WIndows 10 to start is here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a><br />
<br />
What I'd do to save time and get an install that will last is wipe the drive to do this gold-standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come
 back to report another problem: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a></p>
<p>This is especially important if you're running a disk junkyard with an old Windows 8 recovery partiton on it, as this indicates a truly Clean install (which requires wiping the drive) has never been done, and no tech enthusiast would even run an inferior
 Factory or Upgrade install in the first place, or else they'd expect endless issues.&nbsp; Compare to the Clean Install where no one has come back to complain of another problem if they stick with the steps given.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks so much for the quick reply. &nbsp;I understand how a fresh install is always the best option for a reliable system but for me, I have several programs that for one reason or another I have lost the install disks that I would not be able to re-install
 again. &nbsp;These are legitamate programs, I just no longer have access to the original disks so a fresh install is a last resort at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question, if I clone the C: drive with my original Windows installation to an external hard drive and then do a fresh install that should re-build the boot configuration file. &nbsp;I can then clone the Windows partition from the external hard drive back onto
 the laptop thus having my old Windows back with a new boot configuration file. &nbsp;Would that work? Or is Windows to smart to prevent you from doing something like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind I upgraded from Windows 8 on this PC so I do not have a license key to install the new Windows 10 and will not have the license key when I clone my original Windows 10 back onto the laptop from the external hard drive, but I would think it would
 automatically recognize it anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read of someone doing this before and it worked. &nbsp;What do you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            There are some incorrect assumptions here which I'm glad to clarify first:<br /><br /> No software maker would any longer be in business if they didn't give customers an easy way to reinstall the program, just like they reinstall Windows regularly.   if you need help finding a program installer then refer to my Clean Install tutorial Or ask back.<br /><br /> there is no product key for reinstalling upgrade. Just skip the key during install and it will reactivate afterwards with the digital license every upgrade was assigned When first upgraded.<br /><br /> if Windows itself is not too corrupted to start, then a workaround I sometimes use successfully is to shrink the C drive by about 20 GB  using a bootable partition manager like free Partition Wizard to resize from the front of the partition,  do a rescue install to the shrink partition. During install delete the boot partition that has become corrupted or Raw so that Windows installer places the boot files there if at all possible. then highligh

<p>You don't really mention if you received any messages or errors when your system refused to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we assume you checked your Bios and made sure the Windows boot manager was the first boot priority?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several different scenarios can be in play when a system refuses to boot.&nbsp; A bad drive can be one but also some type of corruption of the boot manager, BCD Store or OS loader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of things you might check.&nbsp; First, from the command prompt you can use just the command
<strong>bcdedit</strong> to see if it lists a bootmgr and OS loader.&nbsp; You might be able to output the file to your flash drive by using a &gt; such as
<strong>bcdedit &gt; F:\bcdtext.txt </strong>so we can see it and use the correct drive letter for your flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is your BCD store&nbsp;having a problem and bootrec /RebuildBCD does not help, you may be able to create a new BCD store using a bcdboot command.&nbsp; Something as simple as
</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcdboot C:\Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;may do it if C is the partition letter of you Windows partition in the recovery scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But make sure and recheck your Bios to see if it becomes primary.&nbsp; If it works, it should boot normally.&nbsp;.</p>

</p><p><strong>Several different scenarios can be in play when a system refuses to boot.&nbsp; A bad drive can be one but also some type of corruption of the boot manager, BCD Store or OS loader.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran diagnositcs provided by the manufacturer on the hard drive and other hardware and everything checked out okay. &nbsp;I do not know about the BCD Store or OS loader, Iâ€™am assuming thatâ€™s where the problem is since I canâ€™t boot and Iâ€™m obviously getting errors

<p>Your BCD store looks OK although I am not sure why the EFI system partition has a label of "3".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are getting a BSOD caused by a stop code F5.&nbsp; I will need to do some research but if you can find a dump file someone might&nbsp; be able to analyze it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have a memory.dmp file in the Windows directory, which is fairly large, or a mini-dump file with a time and date annotation in the Windows\minidump folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can find one you might make it available in your OneDrive.</p>
<p>

<p>I looked in the Windows directory and found a handful of files in the minidump folder but they all had a zero byte size with no content so they are basically useless except for their creation dates.&nbsp; I did find a Memory.dmp file which I will attach which

<p>I will warn you ahead of time I am not the best at reading dump files so you may want to start a new thread regarding the BSOD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seeing the problem happened during the RAVBg64.exe process.&nbsp; It doesn't mean that process was the cause but may have been involved.&nbsp; Since it is related to Realtek audio, you might see if you can turn off audio in your Bios for testing or boot into
 Safe Mode from the Recovery options and check if you can modify drivers or disable the sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dump file says:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><span style="color: rgba(30, 30, 30, 1)">FLTMGR_FILE_SYSTEM (f5)</span>
<pre><span style="color: rgba(30, 30, 30, 1)">Probably caused by : </span><span style="color: rgba(30, 30, 30, 1)">FLTMGR.SYS ( FLTMGR!FltMgrOpenReparseEcpCleanup+c3c6 </span></pre>
<p>Since that is a Windows component, something else would be suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see what <em>appears </em>to be some older drivers, like <strong>excsd.sys </strong>
which may be associated with Diskkeeper Corporation.&nbsp; If you have something of theirs, files from 2013 may be fine but are suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the last thing I need to research is a<em> DeviceId: </em><span style="color: rgba(30, 30, 30, 1)"><em>SWD\DAFWSDProvider</em>.&nbsp; Again, not sure it is involved but is mentioned.&nbsp; I do see a mention of an HP Color Laserjet printer but it
 may also just be a general device ID for other types of printers, so if you have one attached or networked, you might try removing it.</span></p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll see if I can disable audio in my Bios and maybe try and delete the drivers in Windows also. &nbsp;(I can always add them back later once this is resolved) and report back. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Cannot download files or images from the Internet &#38; Yahoo Mail</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Now I cannot download or save files or images&nbsp;from the internet or my Yahoo mail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 will&nbsp;not allow me to open my security Bitdefenders.com files for download to update to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran an independent Norton scan which found my PC clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off the Microsoft Firewalls did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which browser are you using&nbsp;to access yahoo mail and other websites? What happens when you try to&nbsp;download any file?&nbsp;Is an error displayed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the edge browser, I would suggest&nbsp;you to try in different browsers to check if it is a browser issue&nbsp;or Windows issue. If you don't have any other browsers installed, click on the settings menu in the Edge browser and then click on 'Open
 in Internet Explorer'. Check if the&nbsp;same issue occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to turn off&nbsp;the&nbsp;smart screen filter and check. Click on the settings menu in the Edge browser and then click on "Advanced settings' in the bottom.&nbsp;Now check for the smart screen filter at the bottom of the page and turn it off. Try
 these steps and let us know the results for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Ben.... thank you, this resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my default browser to Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A few steps had to be taken to open Explorer instead of Edge, so others should not be confused since the Edge&nbsp;icon stays on your task bar and the Explorer&nbsp;icon needs to be added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, when I would click to download anything, the "Hub Tab" top right would show&nbsp;each download at 0% and would stay there ... no error message was provided.</p>

<h2>            System Keeps Crashing While multitasking</h2>
                    When I multi-task my machine(specifically running diablo 3 and streaming from twitch.tv) my computer crashes. When i look in the event log i have a 6008 and a 41. What should i do to find the root of the problem to get it fixed?

            <p>If these are the events you are getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event 6008 "The Previous shutdown was unexpected"<br />
Event 41 "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first"</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are basically just reporting what happened, rather than what caused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it only crash when the system is really busy, i.e. only when say multitasking with demanding tasks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Things you could try as a start:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Run a memory test - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2 Make sure all the PCs drivers ( sound card, video card etc ) are all up to date with the latest supported version of the drivers as supplied by the PC manufacturers support site for your make and model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 It could be overheating IF it only occurs when the system is quite busy. Make sure all fans are working properly and the system isn't clogged with dust/dirt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 If anything is 'overclocked' try turning the OC off for a while to see if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Incompatibility issues with Windows 7 Pro 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I get a message when trying to install various software - </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6dda7ca5-143f-4a4f-bca2-3c8e4accc880" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The message shown is for Franzis Cut Out 4.0. According to the Microsoft site versions 3 and 5 are compatible with Win 7. Another problem is Adobe Flash.</p>
<p>I also get the same message when trying to install Mozilla Thunderbird 31. I am already running Thunderbird 27.</p>
<p>When I contact the publishers they all say that their software is compatible.</p>
<p>I have tried running the Compatibility troubleshooter and changing the properties of the files. I have tried Win XP SP2 and 3. I always run them as Administrator.</p>
<p>This appears to be a problem with my Win 7 installation rather than all the publishers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the screen shots I can see that, you have not typed the commands correctly, there is a space between msiexec and forward slash, so I would suggest you to copy and paste the command I have provided you in my response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;this does not resolve the issue, I would suggest you to create a new user account and try from that user account,&nbsp;because this might occur due to user account corruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the link given below to&nbsp;create new user account:</p>

<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">Iam useing my SP4 since last June and it was working mostly fine (bluetooth turns on too slowly with my mice), untily yesterday. A
 white dot appeared near the bottom right corner. Its not like others i saw in this forum or elsewhere. Its&nbsp;</span><strong>not visible at all on black</strong><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">,
 but instead on white, or brighter colors. Maybe its not even white, just brighter than other pixels. I dont think i damaged the screen with pressure (or anything). I barely use the bottom of the screen for writing as i just scroll up usually to write at the
 middle. I have no idea why this appeared.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">Not really visible on my screen photos but i hope you get it. Its worse in real.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">Anyone had this? Got solution? Or i should get it replacaced? Do they replace for this? Its not directly from MS store, as theres none
 here (Hungary).</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33951b75-ff14-4b71-b5da-b4e1975783f7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33951b75-ff14-4b71-b5da-b4e1975783f7?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afb788de-2bf3-41a7-8bb9-722d724ead42?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afb788de-2bf3-41a7-8bb9-722d724ead42?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db1ce58b-890c-41dc-b6f0-2912861660d6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db1ce58b-890c-41dc-b6f0-2912861660d6?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Marby Rey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- i first noticed the problem on June the 4th and it is still present.</p>
<p>- i have set Windows update to automatic, but i think there wasn't an update right before i noticed the problem.</p>
<p>- only one white spot. Its about 1mm in diameter and going inward its getting brighter (except on black, or very dark colors. than its not visible)</p>
<p>- i cant be entirely sure because of the high DPI of the screen, but i think there are more than one pixels in that ~1mm diameter spot that have this problem. It cant be too many, yet enough to get frustrated because of them on a so expensive device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While iam not sure what i should do when booting in UEFI, i did start in it like you said and the spot is visible even on the UEFI screen, if that matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Patrik</p>

<p>We appreciate your reply. Actually, booting the device in the UEFI and still noticing the white spot helped us isolating the nature of it. Which is hardware related since the spot is still visible outside the operating system. Thus, we recommend that you
 bring your Surface Pro 4 to a Microsoft retail store for further assistance regarding the pixel problem.

            The manuals says that it has a recovery partition and has inbuilt Dell Datasafe Local Software that can be used to restore the Laptop to factory. It was the first time that i bought a Dell and i didn't knew about all these things and hence didn't checked.
 After buying, when i researched the Dell website a bit, i found those things. I downloaded Dell Datasafe Local and tried to install it, but the installation fails, saying the hard disk not ready. I strongly think that the retailer sold me a used laptop. I
 have already checked the Dell website and it shows that the Laptop with the service tag i have, had inbuilt Dell Datasafe Local and other Restore options.<br />

            <p>Understood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>0&nbsp; Did you check what you could see at <em>Computer management</em> [in my first post above]?</p>
<p>1&nbsp; Which model is it? [mine is an Inspiron 1545 laptop from January 2010]</p>
<p>2&nbsp; What Windows version is identified in the Certificate of Authenticity [in your battery compartment or on the bottom of the laptop]?</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fptsvaa.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pnjC2prRqG8S_2dmxVsD9vLLqaBEUsT4pCxqkBMKZfhUoRafo0KUZqLTiKIYucOvAyB35q_SGI7zZwGW19FS0mJ_YREGLlGdr%2fDell%2520Drivers%2520%2526%2520downloads%2520page.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>3&nbsp; The Dell Drivers &amp; downloads section for your Service Tag normally gives a shipping date - click on Warranty Status then the System configuration tab.&nbsp; Does that match your purchase?&nbsp; Or, if you bought it from a retailer, might it match their purchase
 for stock before you bought it?&nbsp; [The entry further down that System configuration page for the Windows version is normally cut off before any useful version info but have a look in case it says anything useful]</p>
<p>4&nbsp; Which Windows version is identified at Control panel, System?&nbsp; Look at the top of the dialog for the version &amp; lower down for an entry that says either 32 bit or 64 bit.</p>
<p>5&nbsp; Have you ever gone to the Windows validation page to validate your Windows 7 installation?</p>
<p>I also have a Dell and I have some recommendations for you. Give me an hour after your answers &amp; I'll have them written out decently.</p>

            The Model is Dell Inspiron Intel N 5050<br />
I have checked the system management.. it shows four disks<br />
<br />
(1) C: Layout-simple Type-Basic File System NTFS Status Healthy (Boot, page file, Crash dumps, Primary partition) Capacity 97.56 GB<br />
(2) D:&nbsp;Layout-simple Type-Basic File System NTFS Status Healthy (Primary Partition) Capacity 145.79 GB<br />

(4) System Reserved&nbsp;Layout-simple Type-Basic File System NTFS Status Healthy (System, Active, Primary Partition) Capacity 100 MB<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The windows version in the COA label is Wndows 7 Home Basic<br />
<br />
The shipping date is April 29, 2012. And i bought it on July 18, 2012. That means there is a chance that i have bought a used one.<br />
<br />
Also, i have checked the installed programmes. Dell Touchpad, Intel rapid Store Technology, Intel Management Engine Components, Realtek Ethernet Controller driver, Realtek USB 2.0 card reader, Intel HD Graphics Driver and Dell Resource CD were installed on
 May 31.<br />
<br />
The control Panel System Menu shows that the OS is Windows &amp; Home Basic 64-bit. And it shows at the bottom that the "Product is Activated" with a Product ID.<br />
<br />
I have also checked the system configurations and components that were send by the company. Many of the Software it shows that were factory installed, including The Dell Datasafe Local Basic, The McAfee Antivrus, The Webcam Central Software, The Resources CD
 etc. were missing. I think the laptop was formatted before i bought, hence it removed the recovery partition and all those factory installed software.
<br />
One thing i would also ask is how to know that the Windows installed in my laptop is done by using the COA label on the Laptop. That can make sure that the Laptop was formatted. The retail showroom from which i bought the laptop is at about 12 hours distance,
 and i go there less frequently. I live in a hostel and my parents bought the laptop and when i came home during the vacations i came to know about these stuff.<br />
<br />
And THANKS A LOT for helping me this much..:)<br />

            <p><span>The PC has, as you suspected, been used before.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it was new then there would be a partition of 8-16GB that contained the Dell Factory Image Restore partition but somebody has altered the disk partitions.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>This problem means that you do not have access to the Dell-intended recovery method and must make you own.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not difficult.<span>&nbsp; </span>I suggest making a â€œSystem repair diskâ€ on a CD, making system images as part of your backup routine, making copies of the Dell drivers &amp; utilities from the Dell website and making your own Windows 7 installation
 DVD/USB [4GB USB needed].<span>&nbsp; </span>I assume that you either have an external drive for backups or have some rewriteable DVDs [if it is 12 hours to the town then you might not have the easy access to getting these additional items that I have
 assumed].<span>&nbsp; </span>When you have taken these precautions, you might decide to change the partitions yourself and it will be quite safe to do so at that stage
</p>
<p>1<span>&nbsp;
</span>There have been some specific questions during this exchange so Iâ€™ll deal with those first to get them out of the way.</p>
<p>1.1<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is possible that the retailer does not know that this PC had been altered.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I say that because of the timescales.<span>&nbsp; </span>The original purchaser might have made a mess of the partitions then invented some problem with the PC and demanded a replacement.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The retailer might then have tested the PC, found that it booted up correctly and decided to resell it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the PC was sold to your parents as a new PC &amp; at full price, I suggest that you tell the retailer and try to either get a replacement or a partial refund.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The retailer cannot do anything to put the PC back into its original state but their Dell-authorised service agent should be able to do so if it was sent in for repair [they would have default images of the PCs that theyâ€™d install].<span>&nbsp;
</span>Given what you have said about your location, this might not be practicable so a partial refund might be the best you can hope for.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have written what follows on the assumption that you will not be able to get it replaced but I would only amend some of the wording if you did replace it - all the steps I advise would still be worthwhile on a replacement.</p>
<p>1.2<span>&nbsp;
</span>If Dell DataSafe Backup Local is no longer on the PC then it cannot be replaced but it is quite a useless application anyway.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It only has one useful function [to make a bootable USB copy of the Dell Factory Image Restore partition] but that is not relevant as there is no such partition anymore.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried to install a replacement once after Iâ€™d removed it but never succeeded.<span>&nbsp;
</span>[If you did replace the system then Iâ€™d suggest making this bootable USB]</p>
<p>1.3<span>&nbsp;
</span>The CoA gives you the Product Key.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is not the Product Key that is in use as Dell have also saved one internally [in the PC firmware, the BIOS] but is the one you would need to use if there was ever a problem with the internal
 one.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most PCs need to be activated but the internal Product Key self-activates to save you this task.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You still need to write the CoA Product Key down somewhere secure as it will be essential if it does ever become needed.</p>
<p>1.4<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Product ID is a different thing and is not as useful.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It can be used as an identifier for service contracts but not much else.</p>
<p>1.5<span>&nbsp;
</span>The missing McAfee software could be replaced but I would not do so.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the Dell website there is a section called Dell MyWay [<i>Dell in Europe has this section so I assume other Dell websites have</i>].<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you register in Dell MyWay as the owner of the Dell Service Tag then you will find several of their utilities listed in there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>McAfee is one of them.<span>&nbsp; </span>[<i>An update to or replacement for Dell DataSafe Backup Local might also be there but, as I wrote above, I could not get this to install</i>].<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am not a fan of McAfee; their tech support staff are not trained in the version of their software that comes with Dell &amp; other PCs and they recently issued a defective update that prevented their users from accessing the internet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have now installed <i><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/products/security-essentials/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a></i><span> instead.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You do not mention what AV application is now on the PC and, because of the PC history, you do not know how McAfee was removed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this PC has been running without any AV application then you might find that it is infected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I suggest that you check the system for malware using the advice from â€œSpiritXâ€ in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/how-to-remove-spyware-from-the-computer/3b0d7959-9b47-e011-a756-78e7d160ad4e">

<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MCPR removal tool</a> then reinstall the new AV application.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2<span>&nbsp;
</span>These are the steps I think you need to take to ensure that you can recover your PC from any problems in the future.</span></p>
<p><span>2.1<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make a â€œSystem repair diskâ€.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a bootable disk that can run â€œStartup repairsâ€ and can also manage the process of restoring the system from a system image.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you start your system, the Dell logo appears and there is an onscreen message telling you to press F2 for the BIOS or F12 for bootup options.<span>&nbsp;
</span>[<i>You could also press F8 to get into safe Mode but that is a Windows command rather than a Dell one so they donâ€™t bother putting it on the screen</i>]<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you press F12 then you can tell the PC to boot from its DVD drive or its USB drive instead of its internal hard drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You normally only do this for troubleshooting which is when youâ€™d use the System repair disk.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You make the System repair disk on a CDÂ±R(W) or DVDÂ±R(W) and then test it - it is useless unless you test it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The procedure is <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/c483b756-3e91-4c68-ab0e-26b64f4fe844?threadId=598818cf-b57e-4cba-a1b5-a75fdd424529">here</a>
 and please note that the problem I describe for some users does not apply to you so you will not get any problems making it.</span></p>
<p><span>2.2<span>&nbsp;
</span>A System image captures the entire drive that Windows is installed on.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is a snapshot of the drive and can be saved onto an external hard drive or a set of DVDÂ±RWs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You could use a System repair disk to restore this image to your drive to return it to exactly the same state that it was in when the image was made.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Youâ€™d lose all updating that had been done after that but you would also lose whatever mistake had been corrupting the system enough to make you want to do this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have run this restoration from an image several times in testing and several times when I had real problems [<i>on two occasions I had to restore from images after I had let McAfee tech support take control of my PC, hence my opinion of their training</i>].<span>&nbsp;
</span>Windows Backup can make system images as can most other backup utilities - if you decide on a particular backup utility for your file backups then use it for your system images as well.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I will describe the Windows Backup method.<span>&nbsp; </span>Connect your external drive or insert a rewriteable disk in the optical drive [an external drive is best whilst, for optical drives, DVDÂ±RW allows you to put on a replacement image in
 the future]. <span>&nbsp;</span>Start Windows Backup and look at the left-hand side of its opening screen - youâ€™ll see the link to Create a system image.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It will include the C:\ drive and will ask you if you also want to include the D:\ &amp; E:\ drives but there really would be no point and the resulting image would be huge.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It checks that the external drive is big enough and then makes the image.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My system drive [70GB with 30GB <span>&nbsp;</span>in use] takes about 20 minutes [and, when I restore from the image, this process also takes about 20 minutes].<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have not addressed the question of making backups of your data files here as I was keen to focus on system images.</span></p>
<p><span>2.3<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make copies of the Dell drivers &amp; utilities from the Dell website.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you ever need to repair your system after problems then you will find it simpler to do so if you have the key files with you.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I suggest making a <i>Dell drivers</i> folder on your external hard drive and start it off by copying the folders from C:\Dell into it [these are the currently installed Dell drivers].<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then when you go to the Dell Drivers &amp; downloads section in the future, copy any downloaded updates to there as well.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This effectively replaces the Dell Utilities CD that is missing.</span></p>
<p><span>2.4<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make your own Windows 7 installation DVD/USB [4GB USB needed]<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is perfectly legal.<span>&nbsp; </span>The USB version is probably the more reliable one purely because of its technology and, in any case, you need a drive that you can then alter to make it suitable for the Windows Home basic edition that
 you have.<span>&nbsp; </span>For other versions of Windows this is straightforward but for Windows Home Basic you have to take an extra step.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.4.1<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First of all, do the normal procedure [see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/how-do-i-know-if-my-laptop-has-an-inbuilt-recovery/Precautionary%20measure%204%20-%20Make%20&amp;%20test%20a%20Windows%207%20SP1%20Installation%20Disk">here</a>]
 but choose another version to download.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do make sure it is a x64 version [so download the Home Premium x64 version, for example].</span></p>
<p><span>2.4.2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then finish making the USB using the procedure given.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>2.4.3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then have a look at its contents in Windows explorer, go to the folder Sources on the USB, find the file ei.cfg and delete it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.4.4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now complete the test that I have recommended in the link but note that you may find an extra dialog box appears that wants confirmation of the Windows 7 edition [I have no experience of this and would be grateful for your response on this point - this
 extra dialog might not appear during these simple testing steps but might only appear later on when you were actually using the USB to do an installation].<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.4.5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Please note that deleting that file has made the USB capable of installing other Windows 7 editions but only the Windows Home Basic will work for you.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.5<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you have taken all these precautions, you will be in a better position to recover from problems than you would have been with the Dell Factory Image Restore partition anyway.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I understand having C:\ as a separate drive for Windows &amp; its applications [I have the same].<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would suggest having a review of what you use drives D:\ &amp; E:\ for.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have my user folders â€œ<i>relocated</i>â€* to my D:\ drive but splitting this up into a further E:\ partition does not seem to confer any benefits.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unless you have found some use for this split Iâ€™d say that [after making a system image of the C:\ drive &amp; after backing up all your data files] you should use
<i>Computer management </i>to combine D: &amp; E:.<span>&nbsp; </span>Perhaps you will want to discuss this further [as there is no rush].<span>&nbsp;
</span>* If you donâ€™t know what I mean by â€œ<i>relocated</i>â€ then I will be glad to explain.</span></p>
<p><span>2.6
<span>&nbsp;</span>I also recommend other precautions for your PC:<span>&nbsp;
</span>have two spare admin accounts, make password reset disks, prevent anyone booting from a USB or DVD without your approval.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would suggest that you make additional admin accounts now to protect you from any user profile corruption that might occur.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then you can ask about these subjects later on if you want further details.</span></p>

            Thanks a lot. I have already made those backup and system repair discs. But please tell me why those need to be re-writables (wont just recordables work). Just for knowledge, coz they are easily available in the locality.
<br />
<br />
Another thing i wanted to know is if the laptop was formatted such that the recovery partition has been removed, it must be done from an external windows &amp; home basic retail or reinstallation discs. In that case, is the windows activated using the internal
 product key (as u described in the BIOS), the COA on the lappie or by some else means. Is there any way that i could know about that? One another imortant thing that i need to claim the replacement or refund is knowing the date when OS was installed on this
 system. All tehse information would be of great help.<br />

            <p>Rewiteables - generally - Any system image or other backup you make is a snapshot and you will want to make a different one later on.&nbsp; If you use write-once disks such as DVDÂ±R then you have to use new disks for each task.&nbsp; If you use a DVDÂ±RW then you can
 either add to an existing disk, overwrite what is an an existing disk or deliberately decide to use a new disk as best suits the task in hand.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So, take a system image as an example.&nbsp; It is a valuable tool that can get you out of trouble by restoring the system to a previous state when everything worked.&nbsp; After you have done a few Windows updates or other installations, you might want to make a
 new image.&nbsp; Some time later, you want to make a third.&nbsp; And then a fourth.&nbsp; And then...&nbsp; Whilst keeping the last two or three can be useful, you'd find disks with old images that were of no real use.&nbsp; Using an external drive gets around this problem.&nbsp; You
 can make system images, delete old ones and even store a set* of old ones then only delete them when you start to run out of space.&nbsp; Using DVDÂ±RWs&nbsp;also gets around this problem but you do end up with a large number of disks to manage.
<em>I have recently switched to just using external hard drives because they&nbsp;have become cheaper than DVDÂ±RWs [and I think they are more reliable].</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;[*&nbsp; If you want to discuss how to keep multiple images then we can do so.]</p>
<p>Rewiteables - System repair disk - This can be made on either write-once or&nbsp;rewriteable disk.&nbsp; Personally, I use a utility to transfer mine to USB anyway.&nbsp; Whilst Windows backup can only make it on a disk, it can then be used if transferred to a USB [some
 other backup utilities can make their equivalents directly on USBs].</p>
<p>Rewiteables - Windows installation disk - The procedure I use for Windows 7 Home Premium could work equally well on a DVDÂ±R but, for Home Basic, you have to use rewriteable media becasue you need to delete that ei.cfg file.&nbsp;

            <p>About the reformatting that was done on the PC</p>
<p>The change was probably made using an external installation disk but several disk partition tools exist that claim to be able to manage quite complex repartitioning whilst Windows is running.&nbsp; I would not try this personally but somebody skilled in using
 them might be able to do so.&nbsp; I&nbsp;use the Windows 7 utility <em>Computer management</em>.&nbsp; I have experimented with an EaseUS partition tool on my USB drives&nbsp;but have never tried to see how much I can achieve with this tool.</p>
<p>Windows installation date -</p>
<p>1&nbsp; I have a record of my last installation procedure so I have checked my files.&nbsp; At C:\Windows\System32 there is a file license.rtf [<span>MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS] that is dated 19:30 20 Dec 2011.&nbsp; That corresponds to when I (re)installed Windows
 after a couple of failed attempts so check your version.</span></p>
<p><span>2&nbsp; If the repartition was accomplished using a tool that did not necessitate reinstallation then I don't know how to find that date.&nbsp; They might, for example,&nbsp;have&nbsp; made a system image of Windows, repartitioned then put the image onto the new C:\ drive
 they had set up.&nbsp;That would preserve the date of the file I have just mentioned so you would have no useful information to go on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even if the repartioning involved reinstallation, it should have been possible for the self-activation by the Dell Product key to have worked.&nbsp; This leaves no traces that can be dated.</span></p>
<p><span>- - - - - -</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps you should just say that you did not delete the Dell Factory Image Restore partition and point out that it cannot even have been done by accident or system corruption whilst you have owned the PC since any such event would have left behind
 a crippled Dell Factory Image Restore partition not a completely re-partitioned PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck,</span></p>

<p>My fiancÃ©'s gamer tag is Kelly Word Up and I can't download it to my new hard drive. I bought a new hard drive a few weeks back and did the transfer of data, but for some reason her profile didn't transfer even though mine did. I am getting the error code
 8007045D when I try to download it.</p>
<p>Also, regarding some downloadable content, I did perform the transfer of the digital media rights or whatever that is called and still some of my downloadable content will not play. It either says something like, "failed to load" or "the game would not play."
 The games that won't play right now are below:</p>

<p>Perfect Dark</p>
<p>Game Room</p>

<p>Hey Darth, I'm curious, is there an incomplete or corrupted profile listed under 'Gamer Profiles' in the 'storage' section of your Xbox 360 console? If so, try deleting that, and give her profile another go. :-) As for the games you're unable to download,
 are you still having that issue? Have you since tried deleting them, <a href="http://xbx.lv/mWsFJy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing your cache</a>, and then re-downloading the games from your download history?</p>

<p>OK, I deleted the cache yesterday, deleted Perfect Dark and Game Room, downloaded those games again, and Perfect Dark played just fine (Game Room still isn't working), so I thought it was fixed. I then wanted to play MW3, so I had to download the game updates
 to that again. I tried Perfect Dark a little later and then I got the same message, something like, "the game failed to load." I don't know why these are the only two not working because my other downloaded games are, such as Contra, Family Game Night, Uno,
 and some others.</p>

<p>Hmm, it would certainly be good to know what those error messages are exactly. Can you record what comes up next time you see it? Also, can you try removing your HDD and then downloading those games on a

<p>I do not have the software that is required to record my XBOXing, nor do I possess a USB drive for XBOX only.
</p>
<p>BTW, the fact that you guys made specific types of flash drives that are only compatible with the XBOX is a load of you know what. We should be able to use any flash drive possible. &nbsp;: )</p>

<p>Hey Darth, I should have been more clear--when I said 'record,' I simply meant 'write down.' I just want to know what that error message says exactly :-) Also, did you check out that link I posted? You can actually configure a range of USB drives for use
 with Xbox 360--I think what you might have seen was that we do sell a pre-configured flash drive.

<p>Well what I do exactly is go to the games library via the dashboard, select Game Room, it loads, stutters a bit like it's struggling to play smoothly, and then my XBOX freezes; it did that twice today.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark still won't load. I go through the same process as with Game Room and then a message comes on that says "the game failed to load" and then it takes me back to the games library.</p>
<p>I don't understand why these are the only two games not working. It can't be an issue with the hard drive because the other games I downloaded play.</p>
<p>As for my fiancÃ©'s profile, I still can't download it and am getting the same error code.</p>

                    Has anyone been able to install the update for the Logitech Orbit AF web cam?<br />
It keeps giving me an error when I try to the automatic update. Plus Logitech does not have any dedicated Windows 7 drivers or software for it. The ones that they offer also gives me an error and does not install.

            Hi VectorRoll,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to the "Getting Ready for Windows 7" community forum.<br />
<br />
There have been other community members that have had some installation issues with some Logitech devices.&nbsp; As you have viewed there are no Windows 7 Logitech drivers released by Logitech at this time.&nbsp; It may not mean that there will not be drivers by them,
 there just aren't any current drivers released at this time.<br />
<br />
One suggestion I would like to assist you with, not certain if this will be the final resolution, but will give you a suggestion to try for a workaround on your situation is;<br />
<br />
Try running the driver by using the Troubleshoot Compatibility tool Windows 7 has built in.<br />
<br />
To use this tool - <br />
<br />
Download the most Current Driver for the Device to a folder on your desktop.&nbsp; The latest revision that may be usable by Windows 7 RC would be the Windows XP SP2 driver.<br />
<br />
(Note:&nbsp; If you are running Windows 7 RC 32 bit revision try the Windows Vista&nbsp;32 Bit revision of the driver.&nbsp; Stay within the same Bit revisions per platform.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
From the folder you have the driver downloaded to browse to the Setup.exe file.&nbsp; Right Click the file and select TROUBLESHOOT COMPATIBILITY&nbsp; ----the tool will launch and will check if the driver can be installed for the device.&nbsp; If it comes up with a "possible"
 solution it will present that as "TRY WINDOWS RECOMMENDED SETTINGS" it will also give you the opportunity to "Customize Driver Settings", but, if it has a possible workaround it will present it as "Try Windows Recommended settings".<br />
<br />
Run it's recommended settings and let us know if this assists you in getting this device operational.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; It would be important to continue to watch the devices manufacturers website.&nbsp; You will want to be certain to download the Windows 7 driver once it becomes available.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />

<h2>            keep getting Update reminders but they are already installed OK__</h2>
                    Running Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; I keep getting Live Update Reminders for security updates KB978207 and KB981852 and install IE8 for Windows Vista but these show as already installed successfully many months ago.&nbsp; Every now and then I get a screen saying I
 must have a newer version of IE to view a web site but that is showing as successfully installed.&nbsp; Any suggestions on what I can do to fix this?&nbsp; I've run several virus and spybot checks.&nbsp; I can't install and run the MS Malaware Removal Tool because it says
 I need latest version of IE.

<p><br />
The following is based on your User Agent string (UA) quote above:</p>
<p>1. You may be encountering problems on many websites due&nbsp;the UA string's&nbsp;"overlong headers"&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;"Nested UA String." These are above described towards the very bottom of this&nbsp;page [but do NOT&nbsp;try either of the fixes yet, please]:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.enhanceie.com/ie/troubleshoot.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.enhanceie.com/ie/troubleshoot.asp</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. You've got an "ad-ware" problem and/or a "hijackware" infection (per the <strong>
FunWebProducts</strong> entry).</p>
<p>3. The item of most concern is the fact that it would appear that you do NOT have Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) installed.</p>
<p><strong>Support for Vista Gold (no Service Packs) ended on Tuesday, 13 April 2010.</strong> Computers still running Vista Gold "will no longer receive software updates [i.e., updates released on &amp; after 22 April 2010 so you're now 4+ months behind on critical
 security updates!!] from Windows Update" until SP1 has been installed (which will require that several Prerequisite Updates be installed first). See&nbsp;<a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2010/04/13/end-of-support-for-windows-vista-with-no-services-packs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2010/04/13/end-of-support-for-windows-vista-with-no-services-packs.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ What does it mean if my version of Windows is no longer supported?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/what-does-end-of-support-mean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/what-does-end-of-support-mean</a></p>
<p>The above may explain why Windows Update (not Norton LiveUpdate) tells you that KB981852 is not installed.</p>
<p>What follows MAY fix some of the above issues, <em>assuming that the preinstalled McAfee free-trial had NOT expired by the time you installed Norton System Works AND that none of your Norton subscriptions have EVER expired</em>.</p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print the following instructions for offline reference. NB: If a step says to reboot, reboot!]</strong></p>
<p>McAfee and Norton applications are notorious for not uninstalling or upgrading&nbsp;"cleanly."<br />
<br />
1. Download each of the following&nbsp;removal tools, saving&nbsp;each one&nbsp;to your desktop:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Norton Removal Tool: 
<span>ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; McAfee Removal Tool: <a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</span></a></p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy, uninstall&nbsp;<strong>Norton 360</strong>,<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> &amp; any
<strong>Norton Add-ons</strong>&nbsp;via <strong>Control Panel | Programs | Uninstall a program</strong> (or
<strong>Control Panel | Programs and Features</strong>, if using Classic view)<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; IMPORTANT! =&gt;</strong> Enable the Windows Firewall immediately after rebooting.<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; IMPORTANT! =&gt;</strong> You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING else online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed Step&nbsp;#7&nbsp;below!<br />
<br />
4. Right-click on one of&nbsp;the files you saved in #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.<br />
<br />
5. Repeat Step #4 for the other removal tool.<br />
<br />
6. Do a clean install of&nbsp;<strong>Norton&nbsp;360&nbsp;2010</strong>&nbsp;(not 2011 Beta!) using your Product ID &amp; reboot:<a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: Do&nbsp;NOT enable or install any Norton Add-ons (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.<br />
<br />
7. Manually and repeatedly run <strong>LiveUpdate</strong> until you get a "no more updates" prompt.</p>
<p>8. Reboot into <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial61.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe Mode</a>&nbsp;the run&nbsp;a full system scan with Norton 360,&nbsp;deleting/quarantining ANYTHING found. Don't TOUCH your computer until the scan completes (could take several hours), then reboot into normal (Windows) mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Open Internet Explorer (only) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a> &amp; run the Fix It in DEFAULT and then AGGRESSIVE modes. [1]</p>
<p>10. Reboot &amp; test by running a manual check for (Windows) updates per <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If most of your problems have been fixed by now, Windows Update should offer you Vista SP1 first: Follow all prompts &amp; reboot TWICE after SP1 installs. Then run another manual check for updates &amp; install all Important (i.e., security) updates offered. Again,
 follow all prompts.</p>
<p>11. Reply to this post &amp; give me a status report.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
[1] Full Disclosure: Running the Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode will delete your Update History but not the list of Installed Updates.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Error Code 80151912</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to get selected for the Xbox Live Dashboard beta program but was banned from it due to uploading a picture (which is now removed) onto a social site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can now not access Xbox Live or any of its features which is upsetting as i have pre-ordered quite an amount of new games and Xbox Live Gold of which i can now not use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would like to have some information and help on how i can access Xbox Live, could i down grade the dashboard level or is it not possible? I also have some images of the issue codes and emails.</p>

<p>Any Help would be Great!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This specific error message you're experiencing seems to be related to the dashboard beta. Unfortunately, if you were removed from the program you'd need to wait until the dashboard update is released in order for you to be able to do anything.<br />
<br />
Might want to wait around for a support agent to check some stuff for you, but I'm thinking what I said above would be the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may have occurred due to system conflict. Since you already tried the troubleshooting steps suggested above, another way to update your Windows 10 is by creating a media creation tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly check this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>That means you have some sort of billing violation. Check your account at billing.microsoft.com to make sure all of your information is correct and up to date and that you don't owe any balances. If you can't fix it from there, you'll have to call support
 and talk to billing to have them help you sort it out.</p>

<div>Dear Mahesh,</div>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm running Windows 7 Home Basic on a Dell Inspiron 620 @ 64 bits and I'm having the problem as mentioned above, except that I'm getting the following message:</span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>"This application failed to start because comctl32.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."</span></i></li></ul>
<p>I have tried to re-install the programs requiring this dll file hoping to replace or add the missing file, yet I havenâ€™t been able to run any executable file or installation interface of said programs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As well, I have started windows on safe mode, tried to used the last known good configuration and performed a startup repair or repair installation with no further luck.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Even more, I have downloaded some registry cleaners, free scanners and dll files fixers just to end feeling disappointed or scammed with publicity. I would recommend anybody out there not to fall for these solutions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finally an Internet site considering this problem as spyware or malware leaded me to this post!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I followed both of your indications, however the Microsoft Safety Scanner have found no threats and the System File Checker tool completed the verification without solving the issue. I retrieved the Sfcdetails.txt and here are some samples
 of log file entries for a file that couldnâ€™t be repaired:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>2013-10-21 00:30:04, Info CSI 00000212 [SR] Cannot repair member file [l:24{12}]"comctl32.dll" of Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Comctl32-v5, Version = 6.1.7601.18201, pA = PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_AMD64 (9), Culture neutral, VersionScope =

<p><span>I would like to know if there is something else I can do to solve this error before proceeding with performing a new clean installation of Windows, which I rather tried to avoid because I have too many programs installed
 and information to back up.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Is it possible to download or copy the file from some source? If so where is located this file? Is it possible to re-install Windows or replace the file by booting from the startup disc without losing data?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to your reply,</span></p>

            First thing you need to do is backup your data. Registry cleaners/tuners are mostly snake oil and can cause more harm than good. Have you tried running a chkdsk /f /r and then re-run the sfc /scannow and see if it helps?<br />
<br />
In some cases (esp if you've jacked with the registry), you are better off doing a reinstall or you could try and run a repair.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div><br />
<div>I was not able to get this issue fixed. It was taking me too much time so I decided to back up the information and perform a clean windows installation.</div>

<p>Hi robertcawrey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! To use an Xbox 360 controller on a Windows PC, you must use the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-360-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming&nbsp;Receiver</a>. Since the Xbox 360 controller and Xbox One controller use different wireless technologies, the new receiver is not compatible with 360 controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
