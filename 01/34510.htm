<h2>            Xbox 360 wireless controller practically unuseable.</h2>
                    <p>Having problems using an Xbox 360 wireless controller.&nbsp; Brand new.&nbsp; Connects fine, all functions work... but those stupid sticks!&nbsp; Really, the response from these things is foolishly hypersensitive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is difficult to describe in text... it's like ALL the useable response is concentrated in a very small portion of the total available stick-throw, near the center of travel.&nbsp; Move the stick VERY slowly, and nothing... nothing.... nothing... then,
 abruptly, things happen, and as you continue to push the stick, the response maxes out, then there's the rest of the throw, which produces no further increase in response.&nbsp; It's a lot easier to represent it graphically. &nbsp; The leading and trailing zeros indicate
 stick throw where nothing is happening, and the 1-10 is the portion of stick throw that actually produces movement on-screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>000000000000000000001234567891000000000000000000000</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, all the useable part of the stick throw is concentrated in a very small part of the total stick throw.&nbsp; This makes it all but impossible to use these things with any kind of accuracy at all.&nbsp; I literally have to "pre-load" the stick by pushing
 (or pulling) it about halfway, then holding it there as a "starting point," then barely advancing the stick to produce a<em><strong>controlled</strong></em>&nbsp; response, and it's really easy (in fact, almost impossible to avoid ) to overshoot the response I'm
 looking for, all the way to maximum speed and into the 'trailing zero' zone of 'no further response.'&nbsp; The end result of all this is that I wind up hopelessly overshooting/undershooting past the target, left-right-left-right... or up-down-up-down... , and
 can't 'sneak up' on the target until the reticle is right there to squeeze off a shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's about the best I can do to describe the issue... it's instantly obvious when you use the thing that accurate control is extremely difficult to achieve.&nbsp; You
<em><strong>can</strong></em> achieve accuracy, but to do so I have to move the stick so slowly, to avoid the 'overshoot,' that I'm pretty much dead before I can get off a shot (that hits anything, that is....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried, both in the settings menu from the home-page area, and also in-game, to reduce the sensitivity of the controller.&nbsp; All this does, though, is slow down the rate at which the response occurs... all the response is<em><strong>still</strong></em>
 concentrated in that very small portion of total throw.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The way this thing ought to work is to have a small leading and trailing 'dead zone,' where nothing happens, then have that response spread out over the total throw, so almost all of the throw produces some kind of response...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>000000 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 10 &nbsp; 00000</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the difference?&nbsp; In the first example, all the response is concentrated in the center 20% (approximately) of the total stick throw... and in the second example, the response is spread out across almost all of the stick throw, with leading and trailing
 'dead-zone' buffers to compensate for 'stick-drift' occurring from time/use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we were talking potentiometers (like a volume knob) here (and we are, actually,) I would say that the pots in this thing are audio taper, when they should be linear taper.&nbsp; Getting kinda technical here, I know... but that describes the problem more accurately
 than anything else I can come up with.&nbsp; An audio taper has a logarithmic response (ramps up really quickly) so a relatively small amount of knob rotation results in a rapid increase in volume.&nbsp; A linear pot, in this same situation, would require many, many
 turns to produce the same amount of volume increase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some kind of setting that I've managed to overlook that would remedy this problem?&nbsp; Or maybe somebody has a source for linear digital pots that I can switch these things out for?&nbsp; Or a contact link to a Microsoft game-design staffer that I can bounce
 this question off of?&nbsp; Getting ahold of Microsoft directly is something I haven't yet been able to achieve, not via internet, anyway (by far my preferred method of communication... I dislike phone conversations for reasons I really can't go into in this forum,
 and I despise chat.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, any ideas that might fix this useability issue would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; There's a lot of games I like to play or would like to play that are available only on Xbox (I have the PC port of some of them.)&nbsp; I found the Xbox 360 at a yard sale,
 and picked it up for $20... I'd have been nuts to pass it up; it enabled me to expand my 'game horizons' at an incredible price point.&nbsp; I also have a PS4, and the sticks on that, while still a bit too sensitive for my tastes, are still far more controllable
 than the ones in the Xbox controller.&nbsp; I don't want to get into comparisons of Xbox 360 -vs- PS4... the PS4 is much newer, and I'm sure the Xbox One has improved controller response to keep on a par with PS4, but that doesn't really help with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long post, I know, and thanks for reading it, anyway.</p>

<p>Hi! So just to be clear: Is the controller brand new as stated in the beginning or did it came with the Xbox 360 you bought at a yard sale? If it's the latter I would first check if the controller isn't working properly as I never had this issue with my
 gamepads that came with the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, did you test this with different games?</p>

<p>Ahhh, precision in communication!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks dzs MeCH,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Controller is brand-new.&nbsp; Xbox at yard sale had no controllers (they kept the controllers when they upgraded to Xbox One.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is identical with any game I've tried; I've tried probably 20 games or so, from Halo on up.&nbsp; The original Xbox games have minor video artifacts (rastering white dots), but play fine otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Granted, the controller <em><strong>is</strong></em> from eBay... I did my best to exercise due diligence to not obtain some cheap knock-off, but maybe I scr3wed myself.&nbsp; I've searched for genuine -vs- counterfeit controllers, and this one pretty much meets
 the alleged requirements for a genuine Microsoft controller, but it's all heresay, more or less; nothing absolutely definitive (still looking for that....)</p>

<p>Hey there Kharrisma!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about any issues you may be having with the Xbox 360 wireless controller. Here is a good troubleshooting guide to help
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/controllers-remotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
assist troubleshooting the controller</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a higher response rate&nbsp;time when clicking or using the thumbstick, I would recommend a wired controller or connect a USB if available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this helps. </p>

<p>Hi XBF Crystal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, none of the issues in that article are anywhere close to the problem I'm experiencing, but thanks for the link anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I see it, the response time is already much too quick as it is, and all of it concentrated in one small area near the middle of the stick throw.&nbsp; Dialing down the sensitivity in-game or from the home menu settings don't affect this characteristic.&nbsp; The
 overall response is slower, true, but it's still all concentrated in a very small portion of the available throw, making it extremely difficult to exercise any accuracy or controllability.&nbsp; I'm getting ready to take this foolish thing apart to get the numbers
 off of the pot, and do some online research to see if there's a version of the same pot with a different taper.&nbsp; This just
<em><strong>can't</strong></em> be the way these things were designed to work (I hope...)</p>

<p>Hello Kharrisma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After further investigation, settings on the console for the controller or through any game in general would not be the cause/fix for the joystick drifting in one direction.</p>
<p>There are several unorthodox fixes available to fix the drifting or uncontrollable movement of the stick, but in most situations it is best to replace the controller.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reddit Xbox 360 Community</a>&nbsp;</strong>is invested into these discussions about the more unorthodox methods of going about the issue, but this would be our best suggestions
 involving the controller.</p>

<p>Hey XBF Javier R,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe I mentioned a word about stick-drift.&nbsp; I know what stick-drift is, and I'm not having an issue with it.&nbsp; The stick is tight (tracking-wise, not physically) and stays exactly where it's put (onscreen) when released, and always returns to exact
 center (physically.)&nbsp; &nbsp;It's "tight."&nbsp; The problem here is that virtually ALL of the stick's onscreen response is contained within a very small area of total stick throw, right about in the center, instead of being spread out over a much wider amount of stick
 throw, which would make it much more useable/controllable.&nbsp; See the graphical representation of this problem in the original post... I'll duplicate it here for convenience:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stick response now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>center 0000000000000000001234567898000000000000000000 hard stop</p>
<p>
</p><p>where "0" is no onscreen movement, and 123456789 is the range of throw that produces onscreen response.&nbsp; As you can plainly see, all useable response is jammed into a small area in the middle of the throw (from center/rest position to hard-stop.)&nbsp; If you
 want to hit "3" and hold it, good luck with a stick response profile that acts like this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A far more useable/controllable response profile would look like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>cenrter 000000&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp; &nbsp; 00000 hard stop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, it's plainly apparent that all the stick's onscreen response is spread across almost all of the available throw, from center to hard stop, making for a much greater degree of control.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want to hit "3," it's easy to find and hold in a more
 gradual response spread.&nbsp; This is why I think that there must be a logarithmic (or audio) taper pot in here, instead of a linear taper,&nbsp; because this is exactly the difference between an audio (logarithmic) pot and a linear pot.&nbsp; I really think that this thing
 was built using the wrong component.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft YouTuber Skin Pack for Xbox 360&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Hey everyone</strong>, at the beginning of last year, Mojang announced they were releasing a community map pack, and it never happened. They said there were too many legal issues. But if we gain momentum and we focus attention on this post(forum
 for suggestions):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2620585-minecraft-youtuber-skin-pack-xbla-edition/#entry30983521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2620585-minecraft-youtuber-skin-pack-xbla-edition/#entry30983521</a></p>
<p>We can attract Mojang's attention and make this happen. Everyone on Xbox Live who i've asked about this said they'd love it, including me. So if you have any suggestions for YouTubers that you'd like to see in Minecraft Visit the Forum:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2620585-minecraft-youtuber-skin-pack-xbla-edition/#entry30983521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2620585-minecraft-youtuber-skin-pack-xbla-edition/#entry30983521</a></p>
<p>And if you think it's a good idea, tell your friends about it as well. If you don't want to create an account on the forum website, send me a message on Xbox Live @AFTM Reclaimer and tell me if it's a good/useless idea. - Visit the link I posted above for
 more information on this suggestion.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Me and many others who want skin packs that we are more familiar with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>I got the same error today. I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, IE 8.0.7600.16385&nbsp;and Adobe Reader 9.3.2. I&nbsp;tried to download<a href="http://www.piie.com/publications/pb/pb10-16.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piie.com/publications/pb/pb10-16.pdf</a>&nbsp;I did not try safe mode
 but on the same computer&nbsp;with IE 8.0.7600.16385 64-bit&nbsp;Edition I could download the paper even though the 32-bit Edition of IE which made the problem was still running.</p>
<p>On a second computer with Windows XP SP3, IE 8.0.6001.18702&nbsp;and Adobe Reader 9.3.2 I had no problem to download the paper.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Pierre KOHLER</p>

<div>See my reply.&nbsp; The files may be on your system and OE is just looking in the wrong location for them.&nbsp; Run a search for Ivy.htm (one of the stationery files) and see if it finds the location -- search on H and C.&nbsp; Also, the Outlook stationery
 should work for OE.</div>

<p>Both links you gave me are for Microsoft Office Outlook stationery not outlook express. The link 'How to Use...' only refers to using the stationery.&nbsp; I do not have the stationery to use so this is of no value to me.</p>

<div>Microsoft seems to have removed the download links for stationery for OE and Windows Mail from its website.&nbsp; There is default stationery installed with OE though, and it could be that your system is looking in the wrong place for the stationery
 files though.&nbsp; It could still be looking for the C drive.&nbsp; The default location for stationery is "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Stationery" and OE uses this registry key to determine that location:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Stationery</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>and the value of "Stationery Folder"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Default is </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Stationery</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>where the %ProgramFiles% is a variable that represents where the Program Files are located.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since you probably aren't too adept at editing the registry, just look on both drives and see if in either the H or C drive at the locations above there is a Stationery directory and if there is on one drive and not on the other, then copy
 it from the one to the same relative location on the other drive and then reboot and see if OE finds the stationery that is default with OE.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also download free stationery from sites that still support these features such as<a href="http://thundercloud.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thundercloud.net/</a></div>

<h2>            Help in setting up a local repository for downlooading and installing all MS updates on all of my windows computers on my loacal LAN</h2>
                    
<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>I am preparing to move to our new home in the country next year&nbsp;where I will not have highspeed internet (15 MB per Sec)&nbsp;and large data capacity threshold (250 GB) (Comcast).</p>
<p>Currently we will only be able to get Wild Blue Satellite service&nbsp;(1.5 MB Per Sec) with a 7 -12 GB monthly&nbsp;Cap</p>
<p>I currnelty use 75 GB a month to update 5 computers and to stream our netflix movies and download all my podcasts.</p>
<p>Could some please point me in the direction to where Microsoft provides the service / ability to download and manage these patches via a single MS source and then I could build patche depot on my LAN?</p>
<p>I realize this is available for enterprise installations it sure would be nice to be able to set this up for the home / small business user.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dennis</p>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is as followed, my partner just made a skype account, she has only me as her friend/contact in her skype.<br />
You/Skype/MS is sending her suggestions from my hotmail.com contact list!! I never&nbsp;agree you sharing my private list!!!!!!</p>
<p>She&nbsp;is not linked, through other friends to them, because i'm her only contact!&nbsp;So there is an serious issu going on, still!,&nbsp;security and privacy leak in skype. The contacts that are suggested are from my E-mail (hotmail) contact list and there are some
 company contacts too!!, so very private i would say!! </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Skype/ms you are using my mail adressbook!, and thats illigal! and Against the privacy law! I have proof of this behaviour, my partner is using a android app. But yeah, You/MS is share the data!!</p>

<p>Dear Ruwim B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reaction.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But this is the other way around, and still violating my privacy,&nbsp;even if my contacts allow to be found public, so that they could appear in a suggestion by skype, even then, it should not be possible to be able to determine&nbsp;which contacts I have been
 associate with though this feature or option.&nbsp;This is a real issue and probably never thought trough deeply enough. (Btw I use an old Hotmail account that I have for Years (20+), and it is converted to outlook online, with skype option build in and I cannot
 remove this.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I my opinion It's like a phone book, it's public, and everyone who wants to be found in the phone book allow there data to&nbsp;be published.</span></p>
<p><span>I don't&nbsp;want to be found in that phone book, <span>&nbsp;</span>and don't&nbsp;have my data published. And I don't want&nbsp;anyone to determine who my associates are, even if those associates have their data public.&nbsp;I only shared my number/contact data with a friend,
 should that friend be able to determine, who I’m in contact with? because those associates of mine&nbsp;can be found in the phonebook?? NO this should not be possible, that's is called privacy!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I my case and others, Skype is only suggesting my contact's from my personal Email list not even a contact list that I have imported to skype and even then, I never ever give permission to read that list, AND that is where MS/skype is violating my
 privacy even more. </span><span>They have used my Email contact list and try to hide their responsibility be telling me and the suggested&nbsp;people that&nbsp; they are suggested in the list,&nbsp;because they allow skype/ms to do&nbsp;so by that option that you are revering
 to. But Skype/MS and you are missing 1 big thing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And as said, people just have to make an account with no other contacts then me, and&nbsp;just chat with me. And skype/MS will do the rest! This has nothing to do with that option!
</span></p>
<p><span>-&gt;I have to allow skype to use my contact list before they even can suggest anything from that list, like people who has that option&nbsp;on (to be suggested),&nbsp;do you agree on that??</span></p>

<p>I had the same problem as you with privacy violation by Skype with 2 other Skype users seeing all my 40 plus contacts without my consent. I sent fault reports but nothing was done. I did not see other friends contacts and I have never had any suggestions
 for friends nor do I want them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night after I contacted Skype Support and they passed on the fault to be investigated my contacts were no longer showing on a friend's Skype. I will have to see if this security fault remains fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent hundreds £s on Skype over the years and this episode seriously makes me question the integrity of Skype.&nbsp;</p>

            This is an utter breach of privacy and I will be contacting a number of major news media organizations about this. This is tantamount to revealing those with whom I email. Disable this feature immediately. This post will be cited in the news piece.

<p>I agree with you about the breach of privacy and its gravity. This whole affair has broken my trust in Skype/Microsoft to respect me as a private citizen and the leaking of my contacts has caused me great stress.&nbsp; I have cancelled my auto recharge of my
 Skype account and have had my credit balance refunded. I will be switching to another provider for my internet communications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If they are dead set on having this "feature", I still believe it should be an opt-in configuration. However, this still tells me if someone opts in, that contact is advertising all their contacts, which would include your account and any mutual contacts.
 Even if the logic was removed from being mutual, would not those contacts be advertised to others just because they are on that single persons's contact list, who opted in?</p>

<p>I have been in touch with Microsoft Support twice and both times they have informed me there is no option to prevent one's contacts being shown, only the Skype "friend/contact" can choose not to see my contacts. So, contacts privacy is controlled by someone
 else!&nbsp; I have all three privacy settings switched off and still my contacts are shown on a friend's Skype.</p>

<p><span><span>There is however on hitch. Using a wildcard "*" to search for new contacts, will actually also provide a list of "mutual contacts", and this feature can not be controled

<h2>            Windows 10 Access still denied after trying all the tips found here</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>System is Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>I've tried all the tips I've found here and still get "Access denied" on my files.</p>
<p>Here's what I've done so far:</p>
<p>- Try changing the Properties (right click, security , etc ...) =&gt; Access denied</p>
<p>- enabling the local administrator: netuser administrator /active:yes and logging in as such</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; open elevated command prompt</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; takeown /f C:\users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\*.* /r /d y =&gt; Access denied</p>
<p>- icacls C:\users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\*.* /grant adminsitrators:F /t /c /l /q =&gt; Access denied</p>
<p>- control userpasswords2, add group membership Administrators, tried the above again =&gt; Access denied</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody an idea what else to try?</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Praveen,</p>
<p>This was the first thing I've tried (<em>"- Try changing the Properties (right click, security , etc ...) =&gt; Access denied"</em>) and it didn't work :-(</p>
<p>According to the security tab all accounts (including everyone) have full access. Nevertheless, none of them can change anything (like the "read only" attribute)</p>

<h2>            Find Temp or Cached File for Sound Recorder</h2>
                    My recording was aborted when the system experienced a power failure while I was recording a speech. &nbsp;Typically I have manually stopped recording and the Save As window pops up to ask where to save the .wma file. &nbsp;With the power fail there was no such
 prompt (obviously) so did the recorder create a temp file and if so where is the temp file located? Is there a cache folder with the file or is the file lost forever?

    <title>Why are contacts so hard to manage in Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daphnethistle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are contacts so hard to manage in Skype</h2>
                    <p>Before the mindless hoards at Microsoft took over Skype, managing contacts was easy. It worked the way you'd expect contacts to work. There was a place for name, address, phone number(s) (land line, office, work, mobile, etc( as wells as the Skype ID. Easy.<br />
<br />
Now its a nightmare on elm street.<br />
<br />
Did any of you go to a Human Factors class? I doubt it. I'm on a Mac and I do not use Outlook. Has Skype become yet another Microsoft Office trap? Is that how I'm suppose to het my contacts? Really?<br />
<br />
Dumb and dumber. I know you hate anyone who says anything bad about you and you isolate them, ignore them or just assume they are backwards.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Why ruin a perfectly good product? Was the intent to get us to NOT use Skype? You're pretty damn close!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't worry, I've come to expect no help from Microsoft and no response. Its so much easier to present you have a real corporation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell I'm pissed? Good!! If you have any guts, you'd call me on my mobile 1-858-254-2864</p>

            I guess the target audience for the new Skype was based on Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there is not much we can explain regarding the reasoning of behind many of these design changes. Part of it is to keep up with modern social mobile applications such as Snapchat, Whats App, Facebook Messenger and Facetime. 
<br />
<br />Its probably best you share your concerns using the following channel:

<h2>            &#34;STOP IRQ NOT LESS THAN OR EQUAL&#34; Error during fresh install of Windows 7 x64 Pro</h2>
                    
<p>Installing Windows 7 on a blank hard drive to setup a dual boot WinXP/Win7 machine.&nbsp; This machine has WinXP Pro on another drive already.&nbsp; The install goes through the final stages and appears to be finalizing some drivers and I get a BSOD with stop code
 0x0a (0x00, 0x02, 0x01, 0xffff80002601daf).&nbsp; I am not sure I got all of the code recorded before the reboot occured.&nbsp; This seems to be repetitive.&nbsp; I had this happen for three consequtive attempts, where I wipe the drive and re-attempt to install.&nbsp; I have
 tried different RAM (completely) and also removed about eveyrthing I could think of from the machine.&nbsp; Installation configuration is:</p>
<p>Intel D975XBX2 MB with Q6600 processor, 1GBx4 sticks = 4GB, PNY Nvida 8800 GT graphics.&nbsp; On MB TI-1394 is enabled.&nbsp; On MB USB is enabled.&nbsp; On MB floppy is enabled.&nbsp; MB based audio is disabled.&nbsp; Marvell secondary controller for RAID is enabled and up to date
 drivers installed during install drive selection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel matrix RAID is enabled, and drivers updated during install drive selection (this&nbsp;was supported inherently).&nbsp; Two IDE Pioneer 115 DVD burners are active and used during install.</p>
<p>Other than the floppy, there is nothing I can remove&nbsp;further.&nbsp; The Marvell RAID is required because the boot drives are running off this controller in&nbsp;RAID/AHCI mode.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't suspect an issue since this driver is&nbsp;installed up front and seems to work fine
 throughout.</p>
<p>The system as configured meets as 100% capable when&nbsp;I run the upgrade advisor.&nbsp; I use XP Pro on this&nbsp;setup actively with no issues.</p>
<p>So, what could be the issue?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard to debug when&nbsp;I can't get the installation to finish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, I got this to work.&nbsp; I did a few things, but I didn't pull any of the drives offline.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; disbaled NIC, 1394 and floppy in the BIOS</p>
<p>2. previous attempts to install I had loaded the ICH7 RAID driver I got from Intel.&nbsp; This time I didn't since Win7 seems to have inherent support for it.</p>
<p>3. I found I had accidentally left my older Epson Photo printer plugged in (USB), but powered off.&nbsp; Not sure about why this would have caused issues...</p>
<p>Installation went smooth and I slowly enabled these items and rebooted between.&nbsp; All is up and running.</p>
<p>Still not sure what was causing the issue...&nbsp; wish I could say more.</p>

            I did this and nothing changed. I went do this link from another page that Microsoft recommended and when I click on "TEST FLASHPLAYER" the webpage freezes. It definitely has something to do with the flashplayer integration. YouTube only works for me on
 firefox, however no on Edge or Chrome.

            Hi Sawfal.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The failure to update to latest version may be due to the same lagging and other problems you have, since everything else depends on the quality of the install - the reason most enthusiasts won't even run a Factory or Upgrade install because they'd expect endless issues.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />If it wont' find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>  But it may get it lean and performing well enough to upgrade versions.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Sawfal, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h3> bountyhunterxx5  say:</h3>
<h2>            How I get game pass for free, and how you can too&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>TL;DR: By completing offers via Microsoft rewards you can save up enough points to redeem a month of games pass every month, essentially giving you unlimited game pass at the cost of a few minutes of your time each day.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago I discovered Microsoft rewards, which if your unfamiliar with, is a program that allows you to complete tasks such as searching for things on Bing or taking quizzes in exchange for points. With these points you can claim various rewards
 which, among others, include 1 &amp; 3 month game pass subscriptions. The 1 month games pass reward costs 6,800 points. You can earn approximately 300 points a day by completing the daily tasks, which means even during the shortest month (which is 28 days), if
 you earned 300 points every day you would have 8,400 points at the end of the month, more than enough to redeem a month of games pass. Do this everyday (more or less) each month and you can consistently earn enough points to redeem a month of games pass every
 month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method i describe above doesn't account for the bonus points you get for streaks and other special points offers, which means you're likely going to earn more than 300 points a day. For example, I was able to save up for the 3 months code (which costs
 17,000 points), giving me another three months to save back up. Also, rewards sometimes offers deals which reduces the points cost (I've seen 1 month of gaems passed offered for 5,800 points) which gives you more points to carry over to the next month. You
 can also redeem other things with the points like Xbox live, gift cards, enter sweepstakes, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes only a few minutes of time each day to earn your daily allowance of points, and with a little patience you can easily save up and get games pass for free. I'm currently at a 100 day streak and have earned over 76,000 points just by spending a few
 minutes each day. I hope this helps someone who maybe cant afford game pass or is like me and likes to get things for free :)</p>

            Microsoft rewards can also be used for Xbox Live Gold, and Xbox Gift Cards. If you earn enough points, then this is a great way to get these subscriptions for free.

<h2>            How to get Star Trek Starfleet Command 2&#58; Empires at War to work on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an avid gamer and recently acquired a new laptop with a Windows 8.1 operating system. It has a Radeon video processor, standard, and is pretty much designed for internet browsing and general affairs. When I play games such as Galactic Civilizations
 I and II, they run fine. When I install and try to run ST:STC2:EAW, it works up until the LOADING screen then crashes. Windows recognizes the problem, but only reports it. I've tried the comparability tool, switching from Windows XP and Windows 98, and it
 still does the same thing. I've adjusted video settings in the utility provided for the game to no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any tricks of the trade I can use? Please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Travis J.</p>

<p>I have tried everything! I have just signed up as a Gold Family Member, yesterday, and I cannot get to the marketplace! Ever picture that should come up is grey...it shows on the bottom of each little window, what is supposed to be showing, but no picture.&nbsp;
 I tried going through the instructions online to fix the problem to no avail. I then called last night and spoke with a tech support person from xbox and she went through Everything she knew to do. Final thing was, after I had changed the privacy settings,
 I needed to power down the console at least for one hour and that was supposed to fix it.&nbsp; It did not work. Before doing that,&nbsp; she told me to go through and delete any corrupted files then cleared the cache, twice.&nbsp; Could it be that I am just going to have
 to purchase a new console???</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p>Hello LISA CASSTEVENS</p>
<p>8C230002 error code &nbsp;means that your account is blocked from accessing certain kinds of content. This type of error occurs most often when you are trying to access unrated content.</p>
<p>You should refer to this guide here.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/errors/error-code-8c230002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/errors/error-code-8c230002</a></p>
<p>I recommend you to retry&nbsp; all the solutions , especially&nbsp; solution 2&nbsp; as it deals with family settings. Sometimes it is&nbsp; hard to follow up on a phone call. Perhaps&nbsp; you may have missed a step. If the guide did not help at all please respond to your topic
 again so a Microsoft support member will be able to help you.</p>
<p><b>Solution 1: Adjust your privacy settings </b></p>
<p>If the account that’s being used is an adult account, sign in to the account and then make sure it has unrestricted access to content. You can adjust your settings on your Xbox 360 console or online.</p>
<p><b>Adjust your online privacy settings using your console </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the account that is having the issue, go to the <b>Settings</b> hub, and select
<b>Privacy</b>. </li><li>In the <b>Online Safety</b> panel, select <b>Change Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Customize</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Member Content</b>, and then make sure the setting is <b>Everyone</b>.
</li></ol>
<p><b>Adjust your privacy settings online </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Account</a> page. </li><li>Click <b>Sign In </b>on the top right corner of the page to sign in to your Xbox LIVE account.
</li><li>Under <b>Settings &amp; Preferences</b>, click <b>Privacy and Online Settings</b>.
</li><li>On the <b>Adult</b> tab, under <b>Privacy Controls</b>, make sure that <b>Profile Sharing</b> is set to
<b>Everyone</b>. </li></ol>

Xbox LIVE online safety and privacy</a>.</p>
<p>If you keep getting this error message, try the next solution.</p>
<p><b>Solution 2: Adjust your family settings</b></p>
<p>Family settings can block the display of content that is rated lower than the setting for the console. Make sure that content is not hidden because of your family settings. You can adjust your settings either using your Xbox 360 console or online.</p>
<p><b>Adjust your family settings using your console </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the account that’s having the issue, go to the <b>Settings</b> hub, and select
<b>Family</b>. </li><li>If you have set a Family Settings pass code, enter your code. </li><li>Select <b>Restricted Content</b>, and then make sure the setting is <b>Show All Content</b>.
</li></ol>
<p><b>Adjust your family settings online</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Account</a> page. </li><li>Click <b>Sign In </b>on the top right corner of the page to sign in to your Xbox LIVE account.

</li><li>On the <b>Adult </b>tab, under <b>Content Controls</b>, make sure that <b>Programming
</b>is set to <b>Standard</b>. </li></ol>
<p>If you keep getting this error message, try the next solution.</p>
<p><b>Solution 3: Purchase the content on Xbox.com </b></p>
<p>If you're using an Xbox LIVE Family Pack secondary account, you might need to use the Games Marketplace on Xbox.com to purchase the content and queue the download to your Xbox 360 console. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your computer, go to the <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Games Marketplace</a>.
</li><li>Sign in using the Microsoft account for your Xbox LIVE account. </li><li>Search for and select or purchase the content that you want to download. </li><li>The download should begin on your Xbox 360 console within 5–10 minutes. To check download status on your console:
<ul>
<li>On your Xbox 360 controller, press <strong>Guide</strong>. </li><li>Go to<strong> Games &amp; Apps</strong>. </li></ul>
</li><li>Select <strong>Active Downloads</strong>. </li></ol>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also did a soft reset on the console as this was one of the possible fix suggestions on one of the many posts i read while trying to fix the issue on my own .&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Stuck at 52&#37;, very frustating.</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I have a Windows 10 Home OS, 64Bit with an Intel I7-3770 CPU and 8GB Ram. with 164GB disk space free.</p>
<p>I tried to install the Windows 10 Creators update released on Oct 17th, 2017 but it keeps on stalling during the</p>
<p>Update phase at 52%.&nbsp; It downloads without issue.&nbsp; But sticks at the update phase.&nbsp; I tried running the troubleshooter</p>
<p>but got the same results.&nbsp; This totally messes up my future Windows 10 updates...security risks etc.&nbsp; I don't want to wipe</p>
<p>my hard drive and start from scratch.&nbsp; I've got Webroot Secure Anywhere v9.0.18.38 running could that be the culprit?
</p>
<p>I thought not since the update does not happen until after you reboot after the download is done.&nbsp; Previous Windows 10
</p>
<p>updates all worked w/o issue.&nbsp; Why is this one causing issues?&nbsp; Really baffled on this.&nbsp; Any suggestions are welcomed, thanks</p>

<br />Yes you should fully uninstall any and all 3rd party Antivirus Security programs before the update. Be sure to run its maker's removal after uninstalling it to prevent trouble causing remnants.

<br />
<br />Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10 is a full antivirus.
<br />
<br />It is also a good idea the have the latest BIOS, chipset drivers, and major drivers working on the system prior to applying a major update. Check with the System/Motherboard Maker's site and forums as well as those of the various device makers (such as video, sound, network, and so on),
<br />

Possible issues may prevent Windows Update from keeping your system up to date. <br />

One troubleshooting step to resolve WU issues is to delete and re-download updates to your computer. would you like to try this step now? Depending on your network configuration, you may incur download costs.

<p>Ok I tried the Troubleshooter based upon when was recommended for this type of error by it said that:</p>
<p>Problems found:</p>
<p>-Potential Windows Update Database Error detected - Not fixed</p>
<p>-Some security settings are missing of have been changed -- Fixed</p>
<p>-Service registration is missing or corrupt -- Fixed</p>
<p>-Windows Update components must be repaired -- Fixed</p>
<p>*** I've encounter this during my earlier attempts and still got the same results.</p>
<p>So I still need help to get around this.&nbsp; I think using an ISO version with </p>
<p>A) Webroot uninstalled</p>
<p>B) All Services disabled and hidden</p>
<p>C) A selective boot with minimal services should help</p>
<p>D) Booting from my own burned disk or USB of the ISO version.</p>
<p>If you think of anything else, then please let me know,</p>

</p><blockquote>Please tell me where I can fin the Windows 10 Creators Update ISO version and not the Assistant version called: Windows10Upgrade9252.exe.&nbsp; I want to burn my own disk.&nbsp; The MediaCreator Tool MediaCreationTool.exe only creates the Windows 10 update
 again<br />
as I discovered.&nbsp; Thanks </blockquote>
<p>BTW,&nbsp; I tried the following:</p>
<p>1) I uninstalled Webroot.</p>
<p>2) Disabled all services</p>
<p>3) Tried to update from a Safe Boot (Minimal) but it said that's not allowed</p>
<p>Now I'm tying to upgrade from an ISO version from a burned DVD w/o</p>
<p>using any networks.&nbsp; Running out of options.&nbsp; It just keeps on getting stuck at 52% after:</p>
<p>A) The initial download is done.</p>
<p>B) The initial update has completed.</p>
<p>C) The 2nd or&nbsp; 3rd reboot which then goes to 52% Updating and stalls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (There's a ton of disk activity but no progress) After 2 or 3 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it states only 90mins is required.</p>

<p>Also, I disabled the Windows Firewall as well. This really has me baffled.&nbsp; Could it be Skype??? What else is left now?</p>
