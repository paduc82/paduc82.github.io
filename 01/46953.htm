            <p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool
<br />
(download and save to desktop - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )<br />
&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp; - **in your own thread**, please</p>
<p>Please also state the Version and Edition of Windows quoted on your COA sticker (if you have one) on the case of your machine (or inside the battery compartment), but do NOT quote the Key on the sticker!<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Hardware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Hardware.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you appear to haveXP, you may be locked out of the system -try this...</p>
<p>Boot into "Safe Mode with Command prompt".&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
At the run command prompt type the following EXACTLY </p>
<p><strong>rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupOobeBnk</strong> </p>
<p>*NOTE: The "Oo"'s in Oobe are "oh's" - not "zero's"&nbsp; There is one space after rundll32.exe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Hit the Enter key </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>reboot to normal mode, and with luck you will have access to the system and will be able to run the MGADiag report</p>

            Excuse me&nbsp; Mr. Smartie face, some people cant afford to go out and buy a fancy new computer. I resonantly have become disabled and can work. I do what I can for my family, this was all I could afford my wife needed a computer. Yes I know its risky to buy
 used. Its the chance we take. I did buy two Genuine windows programs to install.Microsoft rejected both of them. We were even told we had to install windows . I bought the program, and than when I went to activate I was told I couldn't. So any way, thanks
 for the great advice your a great help Mr Smartie face.<br />

            <p>You *can* connect to the internet and download the tool - otherwise you couldn't post here!</p>
<p>DOwnload the tool and save it to a USB stick.</p>
<p>Use the stick on the affected machine, and run the tool from there.</p>

            The problem Rob is that MS has no reasonable way of knowing whether you're a thief or not.&nbsp; Of course we assume here you are not and have no reason to doubt you. However, you must understand what I said. They have no way to know. '<br />
<br />
A little advice if I may. Use honey and not vinegar.. :) <br />
<br />
Believe me, I completely understand your frustration. We'll do everything reasonably necessary and legal to get you squared away.

            <p>Please read and act on my instructions - they will allow you to produce the report and post it here.</p>
<p>As far as your other problems with that PC are concerned - do you have access to the original install disk/s?&nbsp; You almost certainly will need to run an SFC scan - and that often requires the disk, unless the backup files have been place on the drive and
 properly pointed to in the registry.</p>

<p><strong>We've tried everything we can think of and everything we've read to get an open NAT.&nbsp; We've had it be open a few times, only for it to change to strict soon after.&nbsp; Before getting the Xbox One, we had the 360 up and running with no problems, but
 can't seem to be able to get the One to do the same...any advice?<br />

<p>Did you make sure your Xbox One has a static IP ?<br />
<br />
This is what I want you to do</p>
<ol>
<li>On your Xbox while on the home menu press the menu button and select <strong>
Settings</strong> </li><li>From there you select <strong>Network </strong><br />
<br />
<em>You might want to write down the information on the right side;<strong>Subnet mask, Gateway</strong></em><br />
<br />
</li><li>You then select <strong>Advanced settings </strong>This will allow you to configure your IP
</li><li>You select <strong>manual DHCP</strong> selection and you will be prompted to enter an IP<br />
<br />
<em>Try to make the IP in between 192.168.*.100 and 192.168.*.200 <br />
The " * " stands for the subnet which you can copy from your gateway as this can differ for some people gateway usually looks like 192.168.0.1 so just copy the 0 in this case<br />
<br />
</em></li><li>After that you will be asked for the&nbsp;<strong>S</strong><strong>ubnet</strong> which you just copy from what your wrote down<em><br />
</em></li><li>You also just copy the gateway from what you wrote down<br />
<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>After these steps you will want to find DHCP reservation on your router,<em>( it's not necessary but it's recommended )<br />
</em><br />
In DHCP reservation you enter your XBox One's IP adress and MAC adress this will prevent your router to assign that IP to any other device in your network</p>

    <title>Random recordings of clips&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Random recordings of clips&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone had this happen where you just get a pop saying a clip has been saved when u didn't ask it to record in the first place? &nbsp;Is there a way to stop it from happening? While I'm at it how do you invite friends to a game in Battlefield the game menu
 sucks,?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battlefield 4 will record a clip every time I rank up. Worse yet, FIFA 14 will record a clip every time my goalie makes a diving save of sorts, or I score a special kind of goal. No harm no foul, you can go and delete them from Upload later or they'll just
 expire if you choose not to save them.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You have to start a party while you're in Battlefield 4 and invite people. It'll put you in matches with your party members, or notify you of an open match your other party member may be in if you're not in the same game.</p>

<p>[/quote]It should keep a certain amount of clips in your Upload Home or at least as many as possible in a certain period. I have clips waiting for use from over a day ago but some from my initial playing time have been automatically deleted or 'expired'.</p>

<p>I've had that happen to me while starting Forza 5 and while playing Zoo Tycoon when the elephant squirted me after I finished hosing it with the hose station. Not sure how to stop this I think it happens even with the Kinect unplugged.

<p>Unless you recorded 100 other things in between.... &nbsp;they do not get deleted until your folder fills up or after a few days I believe.... &nbsp;so that is hard to believe.. it is probably still there...</p>

<p>I had this problem after installing Windows 10 1709 to all of my systems at work, here's what I did to work around it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used IE to visit skype.com download page and downloaded "Skype 8.16.0.4.exe" (Chrome would redirect me to the Windows Store). I ran the program in compatibility mode for Windows 8, and that allowed me past the Windows Store version and install the standalone
 version.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Gameshared For Honor expansion not working.</h2>
                    <p>A friend and I have had trouble with the most recent For Honor expansion. After the initial launch problem was resolved I could use the Marching Fire heroes without any problems but about a month ago I lost access to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've talked to Ubi Support and they told me that it wasn't on their end and that it must be from Xbox's gamesharing side. The weird thing is that I can access the Season Pass heroes but not the Marching Fire ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend's brother who plays on the same console as him also had this problem, he plays with them by signing in with his and my friend's account, but it was fixed and now he can use them again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help with this would be appreciated&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Gamertag is Antaures and my friend's is KnightOfZero11.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eyyyyy, Thanks for the quick reply&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yeah we've tried this but upon trying to reinstall the expansion it doesn't pop up in the "Ready to Install" tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even had it installed when I couldn't use it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I try to go to the store to download it from there with my Friend's account it only gives me the option to buy it again.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Black screen after installing Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j5wboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after installing Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hello, I have an Asus n61jq-a1 laptop running Windows 8.&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8 a while ago but that shouldn't matter.&nbsp; I downloaded the Windows 8.1 from the Store and all went smoothly till I restarted.&nbsp; It did its thing but then it just
 stayed on a black screen for an hour.&nbsp; I turned it off and then back on and it restored back to Windows 8.&nbsp; I tried it twice and it did the same thing.&nbsp; I tried to re-download Windows 8.1 but it keeps installing with the file it has and fails every time.&nbsp;
 I paid $100 for this!&nbsp; I wish it would work!&nbsp; Thank you for your time.

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you are getting a black screen after upgrading to Windows 8.1, it could be due to an outdated or incompatible display adapter driver. Updating to

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>When I checked in the Asus website for this specific model, I found that the latest available driver is the Windows 7 compatible driver for the display

            Okay, so I tried your advice, and I beleive you are right.&nbsp; I upgraded to the latest driver for my ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5730 and ran it in compatibility mode.&nbsp; It installed and it worked great the first time I booted Windows 8.1, but then the second
 time and everytime after that, it just gave me the good old black screen.&nbsp; But I could move the cursor on the black screen.&nbsp; I will email Asus about the problem but if you are able to gave me any more input, that would be much appreciated.&nbsp; If not, I guess
 I will have to downgrade to Windows 8 again which is unfortunate.&nbsp; Maybe there is some type of universal display driver I can use, if that is something possible.&nbsp; Anyways, thank you!

<h2>            Shadow Broker DLC game crash bug</h2>
                    
<p>I picked up ME Trilogy a little after Christmas and I am now onto Mass Effect 2. On Illium as soon as I go to the cab station to go to Liara's apartment (and view the brief movie cutscene of the cab arrival) the screen goes blank and the "disc unreadable"
 error pops up.</p>

<p>Is this a common problem? I deleted the DLC and redownloaded it but the problem still happens at that exact spot.</p>

<p>It also, and I am not sure if they are related, but when I go hail a cab to recruit the justicar, it freezes as well.</p>

            <p>Hi Aswin_Anand,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I visited the site Nachappa K provided but there is no answer there.</p>
<p>There is nothing about corrupted files. Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple: I would like to select multiple compressed files inside a folder. Then click Extract All.</p>
<p>Then have all files extracted inside that folder, without asking me which folder I would like to create.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Almeida, </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Unfortunately, There is no Microsoft software/option to unzip multiple *.zip (compressed) files to one folder in one operation.<br />
To unzip multiple *.zip files to one folder in one operation, you need a third party software.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can
 be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</div>
<div><br />
Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance, we will be happy to help you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>Can I just say that this must be the worst response I've ever seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple question is met with misunderstanding and incorrect information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, a suggestion is made to use third party software, then a note raised to suggest that using third party software (which Windows has thrived on for years) will break your PC. And the answer to run SFC scan...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You couldn't make it up..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is: There is no way, currently, to unzip multiple ZIP files&nbsp;located in&nbsp;a single directory easily.&nbsp; There are third party tools that can do this but we cannot support those tools (for obvious reasons).</p>

 go to the Hub Icon (horizontal lines.) and go to Favorites (the star) you will see the option
<strong>Import Favorites</strong> (actually in blue).&nbsp; If you do this it will duplicate what you already have in the Favorites.&nbsp; If you are using a Browser other then IE start at 1. below.&nbsp; If you are using IE go to step 3.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have Windows 10 Final RTM with all endless patches that released almost every day, and still I have lots of bugs in Edge browser. The most annoying bug is the issue with Tabs. When I'm trying to move tab to another position, often it takes it out as separate
 window and at this point everything get stuck and frozen. Edge gets completely screwed and the only thing I can do is open Task Manage and... well, kill Edge. Then start it again and hope for the best. So when I do something important heaven forbid to move
 tabs around!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is that when I go to many sites like Google cursor appear in the search window for a second and then disappear which means before I can type I need to use mouse to position cursor there. Yes I know Bing does not have this so most likely it
 is not an Edge issue, but I wonder if Google folks are even aware that Microsoft came up with new OS (Ha-ha-ha!). I remember when IE 9 or something like that was released MSN maps were working perfectly but Google maps were dead and took long time before they
 fixed them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another&nbsp;bug I found&nbsp;(not sure who's fault is that) is with Canadapost shipping labels printing via PayPal. When I need to print shipping label and sample label pops up, and printer selection window appears (that looks completely different from IE11) and
 then I click print it will print sample label, not the actual one. So now I need to click on 3 dots, select "Open with IE11", re-authenticate from scratch, re-enter information and then printing will work in IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next bug with Edge (comparing to IE11) is that many sites Edge cannot handle clicking "Back" button. Instead of going to previous page it will display its famous "Hmmm something happen" and you have to reload page using Refresh button. Same thing does work
 in IE11 perfecto! I have many sites where this thing (back button) does not work, and I'm not talking about special sites where "back" button should not be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more bug (that is bugging me a lot) is the fact that Edge and IE11 are not sharing same security context. I understand that most likely this is for good but when something does not work in Edge (and it will be some sites where we will need to use IE11
 instead) and I click on 3 dots and chose "Open with IE11" I do not get authenticated and I need to re-authenticate. I guess Edge and IE11 do not share same security context, probably because Edge is working in sand mode (kinda more secure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all for now, if I find something else will report back here... Thanks!</p>

            I have given it a try for a couple weeks at home spending hours per day, though I still cannot understand why I keep trying.&nbsp; It was curious when first starting out to find a few bugs and often though maybe I was doing something wrong, but it is just seriously
 broken.&nbsp; But now it is clear that focusing on 100's of&nbsp;bugs is hopeless as Edge is as yet unusable.&nbsp; Any other option is better at this point.&nbsp; One wonders if anyone at Microsoft actually tried this thing before it was released.

<h2>            Moving local users accounts to a new server with their SID&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I want to move local users accounts to a new server with their SID's , as they are large number of accounts (server used as FTP server) , it will be hard to recreate them then adjusting their permission on folders .<br />
&nbsp;I am using Windows server 2008 Enterprise (x86) and it doesn't support&nbsp; server migration tool especially when working as destination server. Is there another way to migrate these local users with their SID's?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot</p>

<h2>            CorelDraw Menu Bar Not Visible After Upgrade To Windows 10 &#40;Font and Background Same Color&#41;</h2>
                    <p>No matter which Theme or Color scheme I use in Windows 10 My CorelDraw and Corel Photo&nbsp;Paint X4 &amp; X7 Menu Bars&nbsp;are not visible. (also another person on this site, (Connie32244)&nbsp;has same problem with X5)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving mouse over the bar the item the mouse is over is&nbsp;visible and useable. The Font and background of the bar appear to be the same color. Windows 10 did this. Not a Corel problem. Anybody got an answer?</p>

Corel use in its programs a black menu bar. But it seams, Windows 10 don't allow the application to draw the black menu bar.</p>
<p>It's definitively a Windows 10 problem.</p>

<p>http://link6155.deviantart.com/art/Silk-for-Windows-10-Technical-Preview-487071428
</p>
<p>After unpacking, copy the files to C: \ Windows \ Resources \ Themes<br />
when turned on, the menu is displayed in coreldraw !!<br />
I hope microsoft fix it in the original composition.<br />

<p>from this page - www.uxstyle.com,&nbsp;</p>
<p>then I activated theme</p>
<p>I checked on three laptops, and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>until resolution of the problem by microsoft or corel, this way is quite nice.</p>

            <p>No Go for me. Corel 4 still all white menu bar with any of the "Silk Themes" from your previous post using the methods you described and the follow link. (<a href="http://link6155.deviantart.com/art/Silk-for-Windows-10-Technical-Preview-487071428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://link6155.deviantart.com/art/Silk-for-Windows-10-Technical-Preview-487071428</a>)
 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install of my CorelDraw 7 and all the updates is okay but I have not started using CorelDraw 7 yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I/We have been using CorelDraw since Windows 3.1 days and I even have a DOS version around here somewhere... Takes me awhile to warm up to new versions of any new software so I am back using Windows 7 and 8 with all my design systems as we at Guru Graphics
 are staying with Corel 4 a bit longer and dumping Windows 10 until there are a lot of fixes. This one for sure and the method they choose for us to run updates on there schedule and not ours..</p>

            <p>Try creating a new user account and run it from there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try disconnecting all non-essential devices attached to the computer and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you meet the following system requirements, your system should be able to run Windows 7:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>* 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor</p>
<p>* 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit)</p>
<p>* 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)</p>
<p>* DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend 2 GBs of RAM minimum to satisfactorily run Windows 7 and your applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, there is no actual upgrade path from Windows XP to Windows 7, its a custom install. So you would have to prepare to reinstall applications and hardware drivers.</p>

<h2>            Instala&#231;&#227;o interrompida em jogos e apps Xbox One &#91;Translation - Paused installation on Xbox One games and apps&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Desde ontem ( 02/02/19 ), estou tendo problemas para conseguir baixar jogos e apps da Xbox live, tentei por diversas vezes baixar os conteúdos mas o erro "instalação interrompida" persiste e o seguinte código de erro é exibido "0X80072F8F", dei uma procurada
 no suporte e obtive a informação que seria problema com a conectividade da live, fiz vários procedimentos mas o erro persiste, desde reiniciar roteador a redefinição completo do console Xbox One S que por sinal não houve êxito na resolução.</p>
<p>Alguém com conhecimento ou experiência com esse erro que consegue ou conseguiu realizar a solução do problema poderia me ajudar?</p>
<p>O problema não é com todos os apps ou jogos,</p>
<p>alguns jogos e apps que o problema persiste: FIFA19, Minecraft, Microsoft Rewards, Editor de Avatar, avatares originais do Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>procedimentos feitos por mim para tentar solucionar:</p>
<p>Reinicio do Roteador.</p>
<p>Verificação da velocidade de rede.</p>
<p>Verificação do NAT.</p>
<p>Redefinição do Roteador.</p>
<p>Verificação de porta e conectividade via cabo ETHENET.</p>
<p>Verificação de conectividade via wifi.</p>
<p>verificação de atualizações do sistema.</p>
<p>analise de armazenamento de jogos e apps.</p>
<p>cancelar procedimento de instalação interrompida e inicia-lo novamente.<br />
verificação do Xbox live. (inclusive mais cedo estava informando problemas com o download, compra através do Xbox live e que o problema estaria sendo resolvido brevemente pela equipe, mas logo após a normalização informada pela page do suporte o problema persiste.)</p>
<p>eliminação de cache.</p>
<p>redefinição do console para configurações de fabrica mantendo apps e jogos.</p>
<p>redefinição do console para configuração de fabrica eliminando todo os conteúdos de apps e jogos.</p>
<p>redefinição com cadastro em um perfil diferente no Xbox e adicionando-o de jogos e apps posteriormente.</p>
<p>remover perfil Xbox e adicionar novamente.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OBS: Os jogos e apps com esse problema não estão se comunicando com o Xbox live para baixar os dados, eles estão iniciando o processo de download/instalação em instalação e não baixam quaisquer dados da fonte do Xbox live e as vezes não atualizam nem mesmo
 os ícones de jogo/app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tentei detalhar o máximo de informações para vocês terem uma ideia do que possa ser, necessitando de mais informações ficarei atento em responde-los o mais rápido possível.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OBS: o teste de rede mostra sempre 0% de perda de pacote e a velocidade se mantêm normalizada tanto em uso em múltiplos dispositivos quanto apenas por parte do Xbox na rede.</p>
<p>(obviamente o problema não está associado a minha rede, logo não tenho porque não estar conseguindo acessar o Xbox live corretamente se não por parte do próprio servidor a qual deve estar instável por algum motivo para mim)</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Translation - <span>Since yesterday (02/02/19), I am having problems downloading games and apps from Xbox live, I tried several times to download the contents but the error "installation stopped" persists and the following error code
 is displayed "0X80072F8F", I did a search on the support and got the information that would be problem with the connectivity of the live, I did several procedures but the error persists, since reboot router the complete reset of the Xbox One S console that
 by the way did not succeed in resolution.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Anyone with knowledge or experience with this error that can or was able to solve the problem could help me?</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>The problem is not with all apps or games,</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>some games and apps that the problem persists: FIFA19, Minecraft, Microsoft Rewards, Avatar Editor, original Xbox avatars.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>procedures done by me to try to solve:</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Resetting the Router.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Checking the network speed.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>NAT verification.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Router Reset.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Port verification and ETHENET cable connectivity.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Verification of connectivity via wifi.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>check for system updates.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>storage app for games and apps.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>cancel installation procedure interrupted and start it again.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>check for Xbox Live. (even earlier it was reporting problems with the download, purchasing via Xbox live and that the problem would be solved briefly by the team, but shortly after normalization informed by the support page the problem
 persists.)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>cache deletion.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>resetting the console to factory settings while maintaining apps and games.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>reset the console to factory settings by eliminating all content from apps and games.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>redefining with a different profile on the Xbox, and adding it to games and apps later.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>remove Xbox profile and add again.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>NOTE: Games and apps with this problem are not communicating with Xbox live to download the data, they are starting the download / installation process in installation and do not download any data from the Xbox live source and sometimes
 do not even update the game / app icons.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>I've tried to detail the maximum amount of information so you have an idea of ​​what it may be, needing more information, I'll be careful to answer them as soon as possible.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>NOTE: Network testing always shows 0% packet loss and the speed remains normalized both in multi-device use and only by Xbox on the network.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>(obviously the problem is not associated with my network, so I do not have to be able to access Xbox live properly if not from the server itself which must be unstable for some reason to me)</span>]</strong></p>

<p>Olá Marco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certa vez tive&nbsp; um problema similar. Na ocasião tive que contactar meu provedor de internet para que eles liberassem as portas da live no lado deles. Não sei se isso se aplica a você, mas para testar, seria possível você se conectar por outro provedor? (Ex:
 rotear o 4g do celular).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation - Hello March,I once had a similar problem. At the time I had to contact my internet provider so they would release the live ports on their side. I do not know if this applies to you, but to test, would it be possible for you to connect

 seria possível o Xbox live ta bloqueado só para eles em questão?</p>

<p>Hi Marco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you decide to request servicing for your console, try to contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP), there could be some security measure on the router blocking certain protocols needed by the Xbox. Here's the list of
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live Port numbers</a> that you can also give to your ISP to have forwarded on your network for a more open connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p><strong>Ripping CDs to your collection<br />
&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>1. With the Zune software open, put an audio CD into your CD drive. When the CD icon appears, click it to display a list of songs.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Clear the check box next to any song that you don't want to rip.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click Start rip.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you put CDs into multiple CD drives on your computer, the additional CDs appear in the upper-left corner of the CD view. Click the CD you want to rip.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adjusting audio quality for ripped music<br />
&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You can adjust the compression quality used during ripping to balance between quality and file size. If you're not sure which settings to use, try ripping with different formats and bit rates, and then play the files. To do this:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. From your Zune software, click Settings at the top of your screen, click Software in the upper-left corner of the screen, and then click Rip in the list at the left.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Make your selections on the Audio format and Audio quality menus.</p>

<p>To rip a CD to your hard drive, all you have to do is go to the music page, select my music apps and lastly select System Music Player.<br />
<br />
<br />
From here you will see the classic layout out. The 2nd option on the left side will let you rip your tracks. The only way you wont be able to rip a CD is if it's one of those retail disc that prevent you from ripping.<br />
<br />
Back in October I purchased a deluxe double album set. It had 4 disc, 2 disc were for the first album and the other 2 disc were blank CD-R so you could burn album 2 on it's release date. Today is the release date but will received our digi version yesterday.
 Last night I managed to rip the 2 disc from October and the 2 disc from the CD-R I just burned. I also burned a few other demos and covers from them on a CD-RW I have and that also let me rip music onto my hard drive too.</p>

<p>Hey Cmack! Are you trying to rip an original CD, or a burned CD? I only ask, because most original CD's contain what is called DRM (Digital Rights Management) that prevents you from ripping it.</p>
