<h2>            Fortnite Update</h2>
                    Started Fortnite Update last night, now stuck @ 47%, Tried re-start, tried update from App Manager nothing is working. It's on an Xbox One not sure what to do next other than uninstall then reinstall but not sure if I'll loose any of my stuff. Any help
 would be appreciated

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>try the manual power cycle steps like mentioned on the following link, be sure to wait at least 60 seconds before powering on again:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If this keeps happening after a power cycle then please try the following</p>
<p>1. Cancel the installation completely</p>
<p>2. try the manual power cycle steps like mentioned before</p>
<p>3. Try and download something else like a demo, to see if that completes succesfully</p>
<p>4. Download the game again to see if the game will install completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

            I managed to install the System Software Update and it installed a 14GB update for Fortnite. But it seems like Fortnite has reinstalled from the very beginning. its Fortnite Battle Royale. Anyone got updates ? Much appreciated.

<h2>            Battery won&#39;t charge when plugged in - Lenovo Y50-70 Touch laptop with fresh win 10 install</h2>
                    <p>I can't get the battery to charge on my laptop while Windows is running, on a fresh install of windows 10 .&nbsp; Here's details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hard drive failed on my Lenovo Y50-70 Touch.&nbsp; The laptop has a built in digital windows license, so I put in a new drive, downloaded the Windows 10 install disk ISO from Microsoft (using another machine), created an install DVD, and installed Windows
 10 using an external DVD drive.&nbsp; I installed all the latest drivers for the Y50 from Lenovo, and did windows update until there was nothing left to update.&nbsp; Everything works great, EXCEPT while using the laptop the battery discharges even when plugged in.&nbsp;
 (The battery icon doesn't even show that it's plugged in.)&nbsp; The battery will charge fine if I shutdown and leave it plugged in, but when I start using it again the battery goes from 100% to almost 0% in about 3 to 4 hours.&nbsp; I tried using the Lenovo bios update
 to update to the latest bios, but it says it won't allow updating the bios while the machine is not plugged in. (It is plugged in, but windows doesn't recognize it!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched the web, and the consensus seems to think that the problem is in the "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery" driver.&nbsp; Mine is version 10.0.14393.0 (driver date 6/21/2006, which seems pretty old).&nbsp; I tried various recommended fixes
 that I found on the net (Uninstalling Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery and letting it reinstall.&nbsp; Telling it to upgrade the driver (it says I have the best one). Powering down and holding the power button for 15 seconds. Uninstalling every ACPI
 driver and letting them reinstall.&nbsp; Removing the power and battery for a while.), and nothing has helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to try installing an older and/or newer version of Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery, to see if that helps, but I can't find anywhere to download them.&nbsp; The Microsoft Help sites suggests going to the manufacturer website to look for
 updated drivers.&nbsp; Well... this driver is from Microsoft, and I can't find anywhere to download different versions of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions where to find a version of Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery other than 10.0.14393.0?&nbsp; Any other suggestions of things to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>-William K.</p>

            <p>Gerry.</p>
<p>Thanks for the links.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they didn't help.<br />
<br />
1) I didn't see anything related to not charging while powered on in the first link.&nbsp; :(<br />
<br />
2) The 2nd link is for a different Lenovo machine (Z570).&nbsp; The Y50-70 Touch doesn't have an Energy Management utility on Lenovo's Windows 10 downloads page.&nbsp; (It did have one for Windows 8.1, which I tried, but it didn't help.)<br />
<br />
The Lenovo laptops seem to have a common problem which is similar but not identical to mine.&nbsp; When they have an Energy Management tool installed and the user sets it to "best battery health" (also called "Conservation mode"), it will stop charging around 60%
 and displays the status message "plugged in but not charging".&nbsp; There are hundreds of pages on the web that tell the user what to do if the battery charges up to about 60% then displays "plugged in but not charging", but the suggestions on those pages didn't
 help (I tried every one I found).&nbsp; My issue is that the battery doesn't charge AT ALL unless the machine is powered off.<br />
<br />
There are also a small handful of pages on the web that do talk about my exact issue (they were all after upgrading to windows 10, which caused the battery to not charge at all while the "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery" driver was running),
 but none of them had any real answers.&nbsp; Some recommended rolling back the "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery" driver, or finding an older version to install, or disabling it.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, when disabling it the machine won't show the battery
 status while using it, so you get no warning that the battery is running low until it unexpectedly turns off.)&nbsp; Some mention that the battery itself might be the problem, but mine worked fine before the hard drive crashed and it does hold a 4 hour charge,
 so I don't think that's the problem.&nbsp; (However, I did order a new battery today which won't be in for a week.)<br />
<br />
I'd like to try downgrading the "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery" driver to a previous version to see if that fixes the issue.&nbsp; Does anyone know where I can find one?<br />

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>Cade here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have the exact same issue as you. I did a system reset last week(wiped the HD) and now my battery will only charge when off. If I disable it (the APCI compliant battery) will tell me its running off the power adapter but then randomly die after
 the battery does. I own another Lenovo and have used the charging cable on it so clearly its not a charging cable issue. I have also seen it briefly charge while on but every time 5 secs in it will shut off. Did buying a new battery fix your issue? I cant
 imagine the battery would have gone bad because of a simple system reset but I am open to suggestions. Though it personally seems like a driver issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help to anyone who can solve my issue.</p>
<p>Cade</p>

Hi banderson1962,<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<span><br />
</span><span>In some cases, you may want to use the command prompt to troubleshoot the Windows Vista/Windows 7 installation process. By default, the
 command prompt is enabled in Windows Vista/Windows 7.</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
The key combination to open command prompt is SHIFT+F10 and not SHIFT+F11.<br />
<br />
Once the command prompt is up, you may simply browse to different folders and track the files which are being copied.<br />
</span><span><br />
<br />

</p>
<p>Been on to Microsoft and had a three hour live talk with them but they just gave me a load of garbage and promised to return with the answers two days ago .</p>

<p>Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit was installed clean last fall on a Dell XPS 1710 and has worked fine until just lately.&nbsp; It now wants to be activated again and I&nbsp;have an activation problem, it won't let me and says I may be a victim of counterfteiting.&nbsp; I enter
 the Product Key but no go.&nbsp; It still works but I have an annoying message in the lower right hand corner "Windows 7 Build 7600 This copy of Windows is not genuine".</p>
<p>I have done a reinstall but not clean and still have the problem.</p>
<p>Bought the software from Staples on the release.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help and reply;</p>
<p>Sometime in your life, things become too much trouble. &nbsp;Is there such a thing as a Microsoft help line other than private for fee service? &nbsp;I couldn't find it. &nbsp;It is a shame we have to depend on the public at large for help. &nbsp;I am tired of having to go
 to IT on stuff that shouldn't happen and when I can not figure out how to fix it.</p>
<p>I am not an expert but far from being computer illiterate. &nbsp;Post secondary education in engineering and additional minor in computing science and oversee my own engineering and surveying firm's IT needs (60 employees).</p>
<p>Gave windows a last chance with Windows 7. &nbsp;By the way, in frustration, I just reloaded everything clean again and the problem was solved.</p>
<p>However, I don't have enough life to be reformating and re-installing Windows anything, every 6 -8 months on the several computers I have nor do I have enough money to have my outside IT group do it.</p>
<p>Windows failed again to operate easily, so I bought a MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>We will see how that goes.</p>
<p>PS, I have had macs before and never had any issues. &nbsp;Only went to PC's because of AutoCAD and this particular computer to run my weather station.</p>

<h3> thanh long nguyen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro start to misbehave after a week, keep switching between the start screen and the last app.</h2>
                    Got my surface pro for about a week, now it starts to randomly switch from the last opened app to the home screen. I even tried to completely reset the device by doing a full reformat, after trying all others options without success. Do I have a defective
 tablet? Anyone is having the same problem? I need to know so if mine is defective I can still return in time for an exchange, thanks in advance for any help.

            This is indicative of a pressed Windows key (stuck on the ease of access or onscreen keyboard). Try this:<br />
<ol>
<li>Open Device Manager</li><li>Expand Sensors</li><li>Right click HID Sensor Collection and choose Uninstall and say OK</li><li>Reboot. The HID Sensor Collection will reinstall</li></ol>

Well, it didn't work, now it&nbsp;happens more frenquently,&nbsp;just keep switching from whatever app that is currently open back to the start screen and so forth, completely at random pace, sometime in a quick succession, starting to really think mine is a dud.

            Hi Sandra.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Story Remix should be available already.  See these guides:  
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3196464/windows/hands-on-with-microsofts-story-remix-the-new-tool-to-make-your-photos-pop.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3196464/windows...</a>

<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/story-remix-editor-photos-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/story-remix-edito...</a>
<br />
<br />When you open Photos app and choose the Create button, do you see the Video choices?  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the April 2018 Update with a fairly new surface book 2. The built in microphone array is not detecting any sound. I have enabled it, allowed app access and tried other solutions for the April 2018 Update Microphone Problem, but none have brought
 any success, and the microphone array, which has perfectly capable hardware, is not working. Please could someone suggest a fix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Siddhant,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Fit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get Skype for Business by downloading it from your <a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Portal's Software tab</a>. You can sign in using your <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-my-user-ID-and-why-do-I-need-it-for-Office-365-for-business-37da662b-5da6-4b56-a091-2731b2ecc8b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
work/school account</a>. If you are not seeing the application on your Software page, you may have not been assigned a Skype for Business license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another scenario is that you are being sent a meeting request by another organization. In this case, if you do not have a Skype for Business license, you may join the meeting online, but not through the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what your scenario is and we will assist you further.</p>
<p>

<p>Sheen</p>

    <title>Downloads Suddenly Stop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roger i.c&#225;mara l.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloads Suddenly Stop</h2>
                    <p>Just got a new system and installed a brand new copy of Windows 7 and I'm having issues downloading files. When a download starts it will suddenly stall or stop at random, but usually within a few seconds. Same thing happens when streaming videos. This seems
 to happen in all of the browsers and software. Example: Windows Update does not work, because it just stalls on the "downloading" part. Same happens with any software that needs to download files from the Internet.</p>
<p>This does not seem to happen with normal surfing, wich I guess has to do with file size. Speedtest will sometimes run smoothly, sometimes will stall, but only on downloads. It will never fail or stop. Upload speeds are consistently good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to run XP and did not have any connection issues. I also own an Asus laptop with Windows 7 and do not have issues there either. All of this is just happening on the new system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the specs:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit SP1 build:7601 </p>
<p>Asus A88x-Plus Motherboard</p>
<p>AMD A10-6800K APU 4.10 GHZ</p>
<p>32GB RAM</p>
<p>Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller (Most recent driver is installed, dated: 17/06/2014)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have Antivirus software installed (because I have not been able to download it on this computer, I just bought it yesterday).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My router is a TP-Link TL-WWR740N (with latest firmware)</p>
<p>connected to a ZHONE GPON 2520 ONT</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following things with no success:</p>
<p>1. Skip the router, connecting the PC directly to the ONT.</p>
<p>2. Disable TCP/IPv6 on the LAN Controller.</p>
<p>3. Turning off TCP/IP Autotuning.</p>
<p>4. Turning off Remote Differential Compression.</p>
<p>5. Downloading in Safe Mode with networking.</p>
<p>6. Turning off Firewalls in Windows, and routers. Alternatively and all at the same time.</p>
<p>7. TUrning off Function Discovery Resource Publication</p>
<p>8. Skip the LAN controller, connecting wirelessly through a TP-Link TL-WN422G Wireless USB Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm completely stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to remind the following: This is happening on a desktop machine with a new W7sp1 install (brand new, out of the box), and not on an older laptop, also running W7sp1 (pre-installed by manufacturer, updated to sp1 via Windows Updates), which I think
 would rule out the router and ONT as culprits.</p>
<p>My bet was on the LAN controller, but since changing to a wireless controller did not change anything, the only thing remaining would be something in the OS.</p>

            <p>So, I did an offline update, downloading WSUS and the Microsoft Updates on another computer, and after I installed them on the new system the problem went away.</p>
<p>So It seems Microsoft had already identified the issue and patched it, but since I couldn't run Windows Updates it would have been nice to know the individual update needed.</p>

            There's most probably been a folder called <em>Sentinel</em> there all the time, although the file it contains may have changed its name. Mine is called WLMailSearchSentinel.eml.<br />
<br />
It allows&nbsp;a quick and easy test&nbsp;for whether your store folder and/or .eml files are being indexed. Entering the random-character search term into the start search box should return only this one file. If it doesn't return anything at all, indexing settings
 will have to be changed. Indexing these files ensures that the <em>Search for a message
</em>word-wheel in WLMail works properly.<br />
<br />
Just leave it there.<br />

I explained what this folder is for in my first response in this thread. You should just ignore it completely.<br />

            This thread is about a folder in the Windows Live Mail store folder called <em>
Sentinel</em>. I have explained why that folder is there and what its function is.
<br />
<br />
You are now asking about something called WLSentinel - is this a file, a folder, a program or something else? Where and when do you see it?<br />

<h2>            Xbox One not connecting to Xbox Live. </h2>
                    
<p>For the past two days I have been trying to connect to Xbox Live. I was connected yesterday because I was playing Sunset Overdrive. Last night I went to play it again and my Xbox wouldn't connect. I just thought it was my internet playing up, so I left it.
 Today I went to play it again, same problem. Still can't connect.</p>
<p>I have tried everything. Everything. Reset my router, my Xbox. Power cycled everything. The lot. I even deleted my network, stupid mistake, now it won't connect again. Has anyone else having this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also part of the Xbox Preview Program if it helps.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Greetings Madness!</p>
<p>If you connect wireless with your Xbox One, and are using the Kinect to integrate with your console, then there's an ongoing issue for users in the Xbox Preview Program that are using this set up.</p>
<p>A temporary solution is to unplug the Kinect from your console.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you keep troubleshoot in the Xbox Preview Program forums: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_early_access/update_preview/update_preview_forums/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a></p>

<h2>            Screen &#34;Twitching&#34; and open window problems</h2>
                    I've had this problem for a couple days now and it's really bugging me. &nbsp;My screen will "twitch", as I like to call it, every second or so, and it's very subtle so you have to look closely to see it. &nbsp;Basically, it moves about 1 or 2 pixels to the left
 every second. &nbsp;Another problem that came with the twitch is that some windows that I have open will either randomly change the size of the window, make the window completely black, minimize the window, or, rarely, exit out of the window. &nbsp;I searched for some
 information about this and a lot of people say about their screen flickering and they said that you should change the refresh rate. &nbsp;My default is 60hz and I've changed it to every other setting, 59hz, 50hz, 30hz, 29hz, and 25hz, and the problem is still there.
 &nbsp;I'm pretty sure it was originally caused by a virus of some kind which ended up forcing me to do a factory reset. &nbsp;I installed and use Avast Internet Security and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware af

</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the system in Safe Mode to check the status of the issue. If the issue does not occur in Safe Mode, it must be due to outdated or corrupted display drivers.</span></p>

</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Try booting the system in Safe Mode and check the status of the issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode,
 you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes. Refer the link below for steps to boot in Safe Mode.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you don’t face the issue in Safe Mode I would suggest you to update the display drivers on the system.</span></p>

<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select <strong>
Display Adapter</strong> and expand the driver icon.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the driver icon and click on
<strong>Update</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the onscreen instructions to update the driver.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;

 things even worse they dont tell you this and you keep trying again and again to download,</p>

<p>Yep it's a region error you have to create an account in your proper region in this case Portugal and use a compatible disk (if there is EN on the portugal marketplace then you can use the&nbsp;disk if not you will have to get one for your region&nbsp;otherwise you
 will continue to have issues</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you able to install other updates?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Disable the Security software (MacAfee) temporarily and then try to install the update.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>Disabling antivirus/security software is an potential threat to the system thus we suggest that you enable the antivirus/security software after you are done with the troubleshooting.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Try to install the update in clean boot state.</p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><b>Note</b>:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download and install Windows 7 Service Pack 1 manually:</p>

            Hello &amp; Thank You for your assistance,
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I can apply other updates successfully.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Before I try any of your suggestions, I noticed that you did not (specifically) address the issue of the corrupt files as detected by the System Update Readiness Tool (and listed in my original post). &nbsp;Will the suggestions that you are making correct the
 "CBS MUM Corrupt<span>&nbsp;</span>0x800F0900" and "CBS Catalog Corrupt<span>&nbsp;</span>0x800B0100" issues?</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>You may follow the steps provided in the above post and also try SFC scan as the issue seems to be on corrupted system files. The SFC scan should help in
 fixing the issue with the corrupted files you found by the system readiness tool.</span></p>
<p><span>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool
 will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC
 /scannnow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your first troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan –</span></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;Note:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;After performing SFC try to install Windows 7 Service pack1 in clean boot state.</p>

            <p>You're installing or trying install SP1 (for Win 7 64-bit OS),OK, but, have you done likewise........for the McAfee Security Centre?</p>
<p>I'd say 'NO' here, and, that could be the 'cause' of your problem.</p>
<p>McAfee products, unfortunately, do NOT last.....for ever, either.</p>
<p>They have a very short 'Service life'. Need to be renewed, regularly. (That is, paid for.)</p>
<p>Worse still, if they are NOT kept well up to date, they tend to cause problems. (Such as you are having, with installing Win 7 64-bit SP1.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the best 'cure' here?</p>
<p>Ditch McAfee, altogether, and, install Microsoft Security Essentials. Fully updated, of course. (Oh,, and, MSE is free....for legit OSs! So, why pay for it when you can get it 'for free'?!)</p>
<p>Then, try re-installing the SP1 download.</p>
<p>All too often people make 'basic mistakes' that, sadly, turn into 'major head-aches'....with their computer.</p>
<p>Eliminate those 'basic mistakes', by adopting better computer skills.</p>

<h2>            WindowsUpdate_80070673</h2>
                    I have two issues:<br />
Somewhere in the process of applying automatic updates my Microsoft Office 2007 Ultimate and Microsoft Streets and Trips was corrupted.&nbsp; When trying to launch any office application the Windows Installer dialog box appears with the instruction to find the file&nbsp;UltimaterWW.msi.&nbsp;
 The use source box is populated with C:\MSOCache\All Users\{91120000-002E-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE}-C\ .&nbsp; I tried performing a repair on the on Office installation, but it does not complete successfully.&nbsp; I also tried reinstalling office ultimate from the DVD,
 but it also will not run successfully. <br />
<br />
Additionally, automatic update fails for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and .NET Framework 3.5 Family Update along with Update to .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and .NET Framework Assistant 1.0 x86.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried Windows Installer Clean Up Utility and CheckSUR Utility.&nbsp; But neither rectifies my issue.<br />

            Hi Nymn.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />A running log of Update History with known issues is here:

<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1809 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  If not just ask back anything else you need.  I'll be standing by here to help as needed with any of the steps, and will continue to help until the problem is resolved.

            Hello! I am a Microsoft Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear you are having issues with Windows 10. Usually, the first step to troubleshoot update issues would be to run the windows update troubleshooter from Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security -&gt; select troubleshoot -&gt; windows update and run the Troubleshooter to check and fix if any problem prevents windows update to download and install. After running the troubleshooter Simply restart windows and check for updates from settings -&gt; Update &amp; security -&gt; windows update and check for updates.
<br />
<br />If this does not work there is maybe one or two other things to try. However, getting a fresh copy of Windows 10 would never hurt. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if the windows update troubleshooter works for you!

<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

            Hi,
<br />
<br />It may also help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi Nymm blue screens are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver on your system, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Sorry i was gone on a trip but i did try out them suggestions you gave me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>step 1 and 2 did not work for me and i saw no change. Both step 3 and 5 gave me the blue screen when i tried to do them. once when i tried to manually download the update and the other was in the middle of re-downloading windows 10 with media creation tool.
 any idea why they would be also crashing my computer? im trying the creation tool again and seeing if i can get it fully re-download but it seems when it gets to a certain point it crashes also but let me know if there is anything else i can do. I also posted
 my crash dumps on another reply if you need to look at them. thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blue screen errors you are receiving (KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED and&nbsp; ATTEMPTED_SWITCH_FROM_DPC) are similar to that reported in the following topic and appear to be caused by an older version of Acronis TI being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/blue-screen-error-attemptedswitchfromdpc/6a021022-9628-440f-b2c1-9b371c7defb2">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/blue-screen-error-attemptedswitchfromdpc/6a021022-9628-440f-b2c1-9b371c7defb2</a></p>

1. So I would uninstall Acronis True Image until the system is stable.<br />
<br />
2. Uninstall Norton/Symantec which is either involved as cause or helping to mask the cause. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10 is&nbsp;a full antivirus.<br />
<br />
Norton Removal Tool<br />

&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Right Click Start Button- Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down
<br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Window move functionality broken in 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tacotuesd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window move functionality broken in 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a three-monitor set up for music production. When doing other things that don't require the others, I leave them off. The problem is, sometimes I last closed a File Explorer, for example, on one of the monitors that is now off. On Windows 7, I could
 shift-right-click the File Explorer icon in the task bar, select "Move" from the context menu, and my cursor would immediately disappear. Holding left-click would allow me to drag the window back into view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, it seems this functionality is entirely broken in Windows 10 (I just upgraded a few days ago). Both my desktop and laptop have been upgraded from 7 Ultimate, and I'm seeing the exact same misbehavior on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone run into this? Is there a hack that can fix this until Microsoft decides to address it?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I'm not sure they are going to address it since it has been this way since Windows 8, but you should use the Windows Feedback app to suggest it (just search for Feedback).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the meantime, hover your mouse over the icon for the File Explorer until the preview of the window comes up.&nbsp; Right click on it and you will get the Move, but note that you can't just left-click and drag.&nbsp; Instead use your first use your arrow key
 to move the window (this locks it into drag mode), and then just move your mouse until it is where you want it.&nbsp; Note you can just hold down the arrow key to move, instead of adding the mouse move.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note make sure that in the task bar properties you don't select to have the icons from running programs only appear on the one where the window is, or you won't be able to see the icon to hover over(it will only be on the screen that is off).</p>

            Thanks for the quick reply! I actually figured that out independently by searching online for a bit, and yeah, I did submit it as feedback, as well. You can also alt-tab to the window and then use the windows + arrow keys to move it back into view. I sure
 wish MS would just leave well enough alone... this always worked great previously, and was super easy. Now there's an added step. Not a huge deal, but still...

<h2>            Activation Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept receiving a message that Windows was about to expire or some such.&nbsp; I chatted with an agent and purchased Windows again [I admit my version may have been dodgy as it was installed in a tiny market in Indonesia], have completed all updates for Windows

            Hi Kristen. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />It sounds like the seller may have resold Windows using an illegal method for consumers to activate it, which is a crime of piracy since WIndows cannot be resold without a legitimate way to activate and reactivate it.  I would contact them and let them know  you may pursue this with authorities and report it to Microsoft here:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out? If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate. We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of retail Windows 10 to reinstall (if necessary) and activate it. I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their sales or Microsoft here: <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US</a>...
<br />
<br />If you were sold a Volume license product key or the PC came from seller activated with one, then It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it.  You can report this to Microsoft here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>.  In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.  
<br />
<br />You can also contact the seller and let him/her know you are taking these actions and that to avoid prosecution for felony theft and piracy they need to make the activation good.
<br />
<br />I hope having all possible options helps.
<br />
<br />  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi Kristen
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You probably have the wrong edition installed and your product key does not match that edition. You will need to perform a new install and use your product key that you bought. Scroll further down these instructions for a second option that might work for you.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

<br />

<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />There is one way you might be able to downgrqade to Home without having to reinstall everything, but its pretty advanced. 
<br />
<br />Open Registry Editor (WIN + R, type regedit, hit Enter) 
<br />Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion
<br />Change EditionID to Core (double click EditionID, change value, click OK). In your case it should at the moment show Pro
<br />Change ProductName to Windows 10 Core. In your case it should at the moment show Windows 10 Professional
<br />Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Wow6432Node &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion, change the same two values as in steps 3 and 4 above
<br />Close the Registry Editor
<br />Insert the Windows 10 Home installation media, do an in-place upgrade by launching the setup from desktop (not booting with Windows 10 Home install media)
<br />When asked, enter your valid Windows 10 Home product key and select what to keep (settings, personal files and apps, only personal files or nothing)
<br />Windows 10 Home in-place upgrade will be done now.

<p>OK - so I have checked for all updates but not reinstalled Windows 10 as I'm not clear on what I would lose from my system when I do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of retail Windows 10 to reinstall (if necessary) and activate it. I would buy only from a major retailer
 who backs their sales or Microsoft here:</span><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US</a><span>...&nbsp; - I have purchased
 a copy as I know now that my version was dodgy.&nbsp; Can you let me know what to do to go about the reinstallation - and what I am likely to lose?</span></p>

            Hi Kristen
<br />
<br />When you purchased that licence, did you clean install Windows, or just apply the new licence key at that time?
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />Does the edition (Home, Pro . . etc.) match the edition you purchased a Windows 10 licence for?       
        </p>

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem with Product Key and its Activation 
<br />
<br />I believe the most reliable solution is to attempt to force activate your copy of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below: 
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key+R to open the “Run” box. 
<br />
<br />2. Type “cmd” into the box and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run the command as an administrator 
<br />
<br />3. At the command prompt, type the following commands: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs -ato 
<br />
<br />4. Press "Enter" on your keyboard 
<br />
<br />5. Type 
<br />Exit 
<br />to exit the command prompt 
<br />
<br />6. Restart your computer 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if the above process fixes the issue!

<p>I've just attempted to change the activation key [no word of a lie, that shouldn't be what Windows says if it's not possible to change it!]&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm curious what I'll need to back up and the easiest way to do so - I've already been through losing all the stuff on my laptop once and don't want to go through it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, some of the answers here were like reading a book and way too technical.&nbsp; I need easy answers!&nbsp; :-)</p>

    <title>Windows Keeps Running Automatic Repair&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Keeps Running Automatic Repair&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I start up my HP laptop, running Windows 8, it directly tries to load automatic recovery system. It quickly says diagnosing your pc, then "repairing disk errors. This might take over an hour to complete." At first I let it run for 4 hours. I tried
 to boot it pressing F8, then booting with automatic repair disabled, but it just went into repair anyways. There wasn't anything wrong with my laptop yesterday. It was able to start earlier today and I could login in but it seemed to freeze on my home screen(the
 one with the tiles not my desktop). I tried running system restore and it says my hard drive file system is corrupted, and the scan and fix prompt comes up but it makes 0% progress after a good amount of time running. I don't know how this all started happening,
 yesterday my laptop was running absolutely fine, and I left it on overnight to render a video, when I came back, and flipped open the lid to use it, it was stuck on a black screen and I had to power it off. Then, like I stated earlier I could get to the home
 screen. After I turned it off after freezing on the home screen, it did run a different scan. I don't remember the exact words, but it was a different hard drive scan. It included percentages, and it finished in reasonable time (maybe a half hour or around
 that). I don't have a windows recovery disk or anything like that and &nbsp;I'm not very knowledgable with windows.
</p>
<p>Hard drive short DST check fails on System quick test with failure ID 908K3H-6P67P7-MFGJWJ-60T003. Product ID: D1E01UA#ABA. Does anyone know how I can fix this, or get out of this loop, preferably without losing data?</p>
