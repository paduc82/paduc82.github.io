<p><strong>Roller Coaster Tycoon</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have played many games in my life so far. But nothing keeps me calm and collected as much as Roller Coaster Tycoon did. I think it is time for a game developer to make a xbox version of a Roller Coaster Tycoon game. They just released a few months
 ago Roller Coaster Tycoon world for the PC currently on Steam Alpha. But really want to see the Roller Coaster Tycoon games come back to the console. I enjoy sitting on my xbox earning achievements and working on building really cool parks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you could have any game back on a console or the newest version of that game what would you like to see come to the newest generations of consoles? I shared mine with you now please share yours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a game similar to Roller Coaster Tycoon for the Xbox 360 called "Thrillville Off the Rails." I am not sure if the game is compatible with the Xbox One but, worth a try?

<p>Thrillville isnt bad but if you want Rollercoaster Tycoon, Thrillville doesn't exactly scratch that itch. It isn't nearly as deep and submersive. I could play Rollercoaster Tycoon for HOURS and spend those hours fine tuning ONE PARK. I too am longing for
 a Xbox One reboot of the old Rollercoaster Tycoon series. I was also a big fan of Railroad Tycoon. I burned many hours on it as well. I had the Dreamcast version as well as the PC version of that game. You would think that current Gen consoles would have no
 problem running a direct port of the PC versions of those games and I would be first in line to buy them on release day. Believe it or not, there are console gamers that like to play games that are not FPS. Why not do a direct port of a best selling franchise
 in a different genre? They revived the Doom series for FPS fans, why not wipe the dust off of Rollercoaster Tycoon? It would sell better than most believe.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Account Automatically Deleted</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 deleted my wife's account-Original Title</p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>it said all my files would stay intact, however my wife's local account was set up as an adminstrative user and did not copy over after the upgrade. I tried creating a new local account with her info, which is couldnt because of an error. After a few tries
 I was able to connect with her Windows login info, but ALL of her file are gone. We had important stuff on her side. This is BS. Anyone aware of how to retrieve it?</p>

            <p>We upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 and it just did the same thing and not only deleted my Wife's admin account but it also deleted all the files she had on her desktop. &nbsp;She works from home so that is a BIG problem. &nbsp;Your new OS is deleting accounts and files!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No her old directory under /users is not there so I can't copy the files to her new profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 is too damn focused on MS and other accounts. &nbsp;It picked up a seldom used yahoo.com account and gave her a user account for that. &nbsp;Not only does she not want that but she has no idea what the password for it is since neither of us actually set that
 account up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge is glitchy, mail really bites. &nbsp;I have already replaced both of those on all our systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have some SERIOUS issues in this OS. &nbsp;If it keeps deleting people's files then this will &nbsp;be the end of MS!</p>

            <p>I'm glad I'm not the only one with the problem, but I'm not glad about the problem. I'm sorry you lost all of your files. We had pictures of our kids when they were babies... We' e been going through several flash drives looking for them, and haven't found
 them. I'm fearing the only copies were on my wife's side. I hope you didn't lose much.</p>

            <p>That REALLY Sucks. &nbsp;At least ours is only work related and not our kids memories. &nbsp;My wife will catch grief from work but nothing permanent. &nbsp;I really hope you guys find the pics somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is a little additional info on the issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after it deleted my wife's admin account and desktop files the system started throwing errors on boot saying it had detected kernal errors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several attempts to reboot we finally opted to try the "Repair Startup" option. &nbsp;That failed saying it could not fix startup. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we tried resetting and keeping our files. &nbsp;That also failed with more kernal errors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we tried a restore point and that also failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are currently trying the "previous build" option and it looks like it might succeed but so far it hasn't completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One interesting thing was that when we picked the restore and reset options it only had my account and the bogus account it created from her seldom used yahoo.com email. &nbsp;When we picked the "previous build" option, low and behold there was my account and
 my wife's original admin account but NO bogus account that it had created. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little early to tell but it looks like MS pushed out an update that deleted my wife's admin account and desktop files and created a bogus account from a seldom used yahoo.com account. &nbsp;STOP HELPING US SO DAMN MUCH. &nbsp;DON'T CREATE ANYTHING ON MY PCs WITHOUT
 MY PERMISSION! &nbsp;THE SAME GOES DOUBLE FOR STOP DELETING FILES WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION!! &nbsp;The whole world does not revolve around a Microsoft Account. &nbsp;It should add but not be required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of us created that bogus third account that just showed up when her original account disappeared. &nbsp;It just showed up on reboot and then everything went to ****. &nbsp;Yeah yeah we just got confused. &nbsp;Not likely. &nbsp;My wife and I are both engineers. &nbsp;We
 make mistakes but when I think I am ATD I just take a look at my wife and know I have a long way to go to catch up to her. &nbsp;We know what we saw happen. &nbsp;We run 7 windows PCs and 5 linux machines in our home business day in and day out not to count a dozen
 android devices spread around the family. &nbsp;I know how to setup networks and I know how to manage PCs. &nbsp;I have been using windows since the first version and I know what happened. &nbsp;My wife is clear about it too. &nbsp;There is a problem here that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try the advanced troubleshooting on reboot and try to roll back to a previous build. &nbsp;No guarantees that it will get your files back but it might.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I would NOT trust any files placed under the "/user" directories as those are tied to user accounts. &nbsp;Lose your user account and lose your files. &nbsp;Put all your files somewhere OTHER than "documents" under "/user".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post if the roll back succeeds.</p>

            This just happened to me, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Overnight, the Windows 10 auto-update process deleted any user-created files on the hard drive.&nbsp; I lost a bunch of photos I had not yet moved to an external hard drive.&nbsp; The Microsoft help desk&nbsp;person who looked at the
 issue - actually connected remotely&nbsp;to my computer - &nbsp;could do absolutely nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am buying a Mac.&nbsp; The only bright spot:&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought this computer at Costco within the last 90 days, so&nbsp;I can return it.

<h2>            How to fix temporary profile on windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This started a few days ago;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i log in, This message pops up saying <strong><u>you are logged into Windows temporary profiles</u></strong> or somewhat. It happens every time i log into my regular computer profile/account. I haven't downloaded anything new onto my desktop and this
 just came out of the blue to me. It won't let me open my documents, pictures or my main internet server {Google Chrome} When i check for my documents in the folder, They are simply not there. And every time i log on then log off, Everything i've done on my
 computer<u> <strong>is not saved?</strong></u>&nbsp; Also, While my computer profile/account is loading {when it says welcome with the little blue ring} It quickly changes to "preparing desktop {which it usally does not do.}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>How do i fix this??</strong></u> </p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>
<p>Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by using a<br />
temporary profile: "The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded"<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />

<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

            I experienced the same problem with ridiculously high CPU useage after updating from Win8 to Win8.1. It turned out to be a known bug with a very simple workaround. I'm guessing that you're experiencing this same issue.<br />
<br />
If you run Task Manager and go to the Performance tab, you'll probably see that the CPU utilization is really high (80-100%) for no apparent reason. Also, if you go to the Processes or Details tab, you'll notice multiple instances of a process called "sdclt.exe"
 appearing &amp; re-appearing every few seconds. These processes are causing your CPU to constantly run at near-capacity, and your fan is running at high speed in an attempt to keep it cool.<br />
<br />
If this is what's happening on your system, here's the fix:<br />
- Go to Task Scheduler<br />
- Task Scheduler Library -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; Windows Backup<br />
- Disable the "ConfigNotification" task<br />
- Restart your computer<br />
<br />
I've experienced this same issue on 3 different systems so far. I've been able to fix all of them using the above method.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this fixes your noisy fan/high CPU utilization problem.<br />
<br />
Amazing that Microsoft hasn't yet aknowledged this problem and issued a fix for it.

            Same problem here with a loud fan after installing 8.1. I tried disabling the confignotification task and it seems to have helped a little but it's not running the same as it was before. I hope microsoft releases something soon.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Update your Graphic Driver simply by windows update. My Laptop is Sony VAIO VPCEA16FG. The latest version of AMD Catalyst downloaded by Windows Update reduced the fan noise to normal.</p>
<p><strong>but there is a new problem!!!!</strong></p>
<p>after update the driver, the media player have no video playback and just play sound.
</p>
<p>However, the fan noise reduced.</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />

 what dave said:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I struggled with this all morning loading various codecs, tweaking registry, etc. etc.&nbsp; with no success.&nbsp; What I finally discovered was that one recommendation I read, suggested loading K-Lite Codec Pack, which I did.&nbsp; This does
 in fact work or did the second time for me when I paid attention to the various installation prompts.&nbsp; There are one or two screens that specifically discuss thumbnail generation and the default did not have AVI among others selected.&nbsp; On my second install,
 I changed it to make all default to WMP.&nbsp;Once this was done, all my thumbnails returned. &nbsp;Hope this save somebody from the time I wasted today...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the K-Lite pack for many years. I'm no media buff and not very familiar with alternatives, it's just the one I've always used.&nbsp; I'm actually having a conversation about it over in a
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/e8567237-03d2-4a88-8f9d-2f709f0af399">
thread about Movie Maker</a>'s codec handlers, where the k-lite pack helped allow Media Player to play unplayable files.&nbsp; Although in your case you can already play them, so hopefully just adding the thumbnail generation in the optional features of k-lite install
 that Dave and I have used, you can get them to show up.</p>

<h2>            Win10Pro - File Explorer Folder&#47;File auto rename</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded my home machine to Windows 10 Pro and I am having a weird problem with file explorer. Whenever I select a file using a mouse click (not double click, or click through), it automatically put the file/folder name in edit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens when I use the keyboard to navigate to the file. e.g., I will press down arrow to scroll to a file, if I stopped pressing the arrow, it will put the file/folder's name in edit mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very annoying, but I am sure (hope) there is a simpler fix than clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <span>Hi Josh,</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Go to File explorer option and try to restore the mouse default settings.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press Windows key + X on the keyboard at once.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select Control Panel and click on File explorer option.</p>
</li><li>Now click on Restore default button. </li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If that does not help, try the below methods.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persist, I suggest you to boot the system in clean boot state and check if the issue still persist.
<span>Clean boot</span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link
 on how to perform <strong>Clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>

<h2>            EA UFC DEMO</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone played the demo yet??? I think the game is freaking awesome!!! best MMA gave to date...only knocks i have on it is&nbsp; that when you see the instant replays you will notice how horrible the hit contact is with the fighters swinging at the head ...hopefully
 it will be smoother for the full game which im sure it will...and my other gripe is that you cant really throw in a few bombs at the end&nbsp; when you knock out your opponent at the end of the fight...you know FINISH THE FIGHT! But overall the game is really fun
 and very realistic looking .If your into MMA you should download this and give it a try its worth it.</p>

 it can be from the partitioning of the Hard drive. my computer has the recovery partitions in front of the Operating System Partitions which I think is causing he problem when&nbsp;upgrading&nbsp;because windows 10 wants to install in the&nbsp;recovery partitions . I have
 8.1 still installed. Other ASUS computers have this issue already.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the reply, </p>
<p>I haven't started the Upgrade Process at all, I still havent done anything yet, but get windows 10 app wants to get going and I reschedule the installation for now. I will be installing via &nbsp;Get Windows 10 application</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have a USB Recovery Partition on a USB Key for WIndows 8.1 on my Laptop (ASUS X200MA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I upgrade to Windows 10 and experience a problem, I can use that Recovery Partition I made to put Windows 8.1 back on? Or would have to make an installation media that you referenced?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi, I've been struggling with this debug error for the past few hours and was hoping someone could help me out? This has only happened since a game I used to play and had already installed on my laptop needed updating through patches and continues to fail
 after a little time of downloading the patches. i have tried a few options like uninstalling visual studio c ++, uninstalling the game and a few others I found online but made no progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has crashed my PC - unrecoverable&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Windows 10 on my computer and used for almost a month, and I must say that I was quite happy with this new release.</p>
<p>Later, I have then installed new Windows updates and since then it crashed, blus screen, etc.. impossible access the desktop. I tried to recover my data and even recover a previous version but failed, even the repair functionality did not worked. I lost
 all my files.</p>
<p>And I think that it damaged a driver. So. I had to re-install Windows 7 back. </p>
<p>I would like to use Windows 10 again, but of course I am not feeling confident now.</p>
<p>What does the Microsoft support advise at this point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

            The workaround for the message list display is to select <em>Message list</em> &gt;
<em>One-line view</em> on the <em>View</em> tab. I don't think you can do anything about the icon display in the header bar.

<h2>            Microsoft Office Outlook 2003</h2>
                    
<p>Running Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. I have Office 2003 Professional. Today, 7 June 09, apparently there were a lot of updates not only to XP but office as well. the .NET and silverlight was just a couple of them. anyway, after that, I rebooted
 as instructed but now I get an error when I try and reply to someone that has sent me an email. It states :&nbsp;
<strong>"The message interface has returned an unknown error. If the problem persists try restarting Outlook</strong>."<br />
<br />
I have restarted Outlook 2003 several times and I get the same error. I havent changed my email account or anything (it seems) that would cause it not to operate properly as it had for the last year.
<br />
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cary</p>

<h2>            Combat Flight Simulator WW2 Europe on Windows Vista - Joystick problems____</h2>
                    
<p><br />
<br />
Have just loaded Combat Flight Simulator WWii Europe disk onto Vista machine. Have Sidewinder Joystick. PC recognises joystick activity. Shows in Calibration etc. Game loads perfectly. But no joystick activity 'reaches' the game itself. Keyboard activity does.
 But nothing from the Joystick. Any ideas ?</p>

<p><span>Hello Grahampop,</span></p>
<p>W<span>elcome to Microsoft answers forums!</span></p>
<p><span>We need to first check if joysticks are working fine or not.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Please check on a different computer to see if you have the same issue or not.<br />

Also take a look at the below article:<br />

    <title>windows 10 blue screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boydmatzen  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 blue screen</h2>
                    It's too bad Microsoft doesn't stand behind its products when the screen goes blue,&nbsp;a known problem, they don't seem to want to stand behind it to bed was a good&nbsp;product might have to look at Apple in the future since they tend to stand behind it even
 if it cost, really disappointed.<br />
<br />
Don't understand why they can't set behind the product without charging you when they know it is a problem. System exception yeah right.<br />
<br />
Anybody understand why they don't stand behind their product.

            blue screen last time caused me to rebuild my system because not even the geeks (2 different companies) could resolve the problem. I'm tired of companies that know they have a situation and don't stand behind the solution without charging for it.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does the Blue screen error say exactly?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than finding out what error is, you've decided that it has to be all Microsoft's fault?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can appreciate you're annoyed by your issue, but ranting isn't going to help much. You need to give us more info please.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Lock Screen Slideshow Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to change it so the lock screen for my computer plays a slideshow of images.</p>
<p>I went to:</p>
<p>Lock screen settings&gt;Drop down&gt;Clicked on "Slideshow"&gt;Clicked "Add a folder" &gt;Selected my folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this after selected:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://imgur.com/Gyouhf5</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it oddly doesn't work. When I go to the lock screen, it simply shows the default picture instead of my slideshow pictures. Help?</p>

    <title>Why does the folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does the folder &#92;windows&#92;ServiceProfiles&#92;NetworkService&#92;App Data&#92;Local&#92;Microsoft&#92;Media Player&#92;Art Cache&#92;Local MLS have cover art for all the tracks in iTunes</h2>
                    <p>I have been working on questions about the time taken by MSE to do a complete scan.&nbsp; I discovered that MSE scan spends about 4 hours going through the files in "\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\App Data\Local\Microsoft\Media Player\Art Cache\Local
 MLS". Thanks to information from the community I have finally been able to&nbsp;get to these files and look at them. I was more then a little surprised to find that the cover art is the cover art for the tracks I have in iTunes.&nbsp;I have deleted a couple of the files
 and I discovered that the cover art for iTunes is still working. Windows Media Player doesn't have the music just the cover art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So does anyone know why Windows Media Player is loading cover art files on my system for iTunes tracks? It loads the same cover art for each track in an album no wonder there are so many files in this folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have turned off the service "wmpnetwk" and it should not start even when I restart the computer; again thanks to the community. So if I just delete these files will that be the end of the matter?</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The Player downloads album art from an online database where the information is supplied by a variety of non-Microsoft data providers, such as AMG.</p>
<p>The Player downloads album art when you rip a CD. To do so, the Player attempts to match the CD to an entry in the online database. If it finds a match, the Player automatically downloads the media information that is available for the CD,
 including album art. In addition, the Player periodically scans your library for songs that are missing album art. If it can match a song that is missing album art to an entry in the online database, the Player will download the missing album art. For information
 about changing how the Player downloads album art and other media information, see the question about getting the Player to fix media information automatically in

<div>
Why is album art missing sometimes?
<div>
<p>The Player might not be able to download album art from the database in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You aren't connected to the Internet when ripping a CD.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You are connected to the Internet, but the online database is missing album art (or there is no media information at all) for the CD you are ripping.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Your system administrator has prevented your computer from downloading items such as album art from the Internet.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You ripped the CD using a program other than <span>
Windows</span> Media Player; doing so might prevent the Player from finding a match in the online database.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Finally, if the online database contains incorrect album art for a CD, the Player will download that album art.</p>
<p>The following procedures describe methods you can use to fix missing or incorrect album art.</p>

                    I am using Movie Maker 2 on XP and can't figure out how to add a movie to the credits with the Credits: Video Left option.&nbsp; I tried to drag the video onto the title overlay (as suggested in another Q&amp;A for Vista), but this doesn't seem to work for me.&nbsp;
 It keeps trying to add it to the Audio section.

==============================<br />
Ok...I get it now...sorry, I'm just an old geezer...<br />
I'll just give you all the steps that work for me...<br />
<br />
In timeline view...add the video clip that will be included<br />
in the Credits to the Video Track...<br />
<br />
With that clip selected...go to...Tools / Titles and Credits...<br />
<br />
Choose...Title on the selected clip...<br />
<br />
Scroll down and click...Change Title Animation...<br />
<br />
Choose...Credits Video Left...<br />
<br />
Scroll down and click...Edit the title text...<br />
<br />
Enter your credits on the lines...<br />
<br />
Now...click...Done, add title to movie...<br />
<br />
That should do it.

<p>Yes, if you've removed the cable, reset the network settings, and restarted the console, and it's still telling you a cable is connected, it sounds like the console will need a repair. You can check your warranty status and set one up

<p>Hi Hiten,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">I've been looking into upgrading 8.1 to 10. Just expected to run a quick check using a Microsoft tool, fix any minor errors it found, then be told it's now okay to install Windows 10. In my fantasy, I would then click execute and
 10 minutes later (at most!) I would be using my lovely new Operating System. I'm 2 hours in, slightly wiser, and can definitely say, "Times have definitely changed!" The concept of Click (or Load) and Play are obsolete I think.</p>
<p>Anywho... </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">So far I have found a major stumbling block and a potential way through this maze:</p>
<p>On advice of Microsoft, I ran the following <em>Microsoft troubleshooter</em>: I obtained this file from the Microsoft website --&gt; searched for troubleshooter using the following search term: &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px"><strong>GW10Appdiagnostic.diagcab</strong> </p>
<p>Downloaded and ran this on my Toshiba Laptop, which is running on<em><strong>Windows 8.1</strong></em>&nbsp;- which is, according to Microsoft,
<em>fully compatible with the Windows 10 upgrade</em></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Troubleshooter tells me I'm using the <strong>non-compatible
</strong>operating system <strong>Windows 6.x.y</strong></em> - At this point I thought (but didn't say) ****, It's Windows 8.1 not Windows six point something!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Drilling down into the details of this troubleshooter, I discovered the necessity to check for installation of several updates from Microsoft. I should point out that I had ticked the box saying that the Troubleshooter should "Auto

<p style="margin-left: 30px">When I ran this Troubleshooter again, I left the Auto Fix tick-box un-ticked. Result was much better. It listed the missing files I would need and even asked if I would like to install them now! Pointers... Major files missing on

            <p>Hi Hiten,</p>
<p>Following on from my reply yesterday, I can confirm that the troubleshooter identified all of the issues preventing Windows 10 compatibility. After addressing them, and restarting the laptop, the Windows 10 icon (where you can reserve a copy) appeared in
 the Quick Startup menu. Ed</p>

            <p>I suggest that you re-read the information that I gave you about using the Media Creation Tool, paying attention to this part:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Warning </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to upgrade to <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> for free, you need to use the
<span>Upgrade this PC now</span> option. If you haven't upgraded to <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> yet and perform a clean installation, you'll need to enter a product key or buy a license in order to activate
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>. </p>
</li></ul>
<p>It was all explained in my original reply to you.</p>
