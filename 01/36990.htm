    <title>After upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, recovery disk becomes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, recovery disk becomes invalid media &#40;media inserted is not valid&#41;</h2>
                    I have been fighting with my computer for well over a week now, but it's not the problem, Microsoft is. I have spent way 50 hours trying to resolve corrupt files/bad drivers on my computer with 3 different calls, hours of work with the techies and multiple
 scans and attempted fixes through command prompt. Even if they could fix it, help desk will not deal with the real problem, that a valid Windows 8 copy bought on a laptop, once upgraded to Windows 8.1 will no longer produce a viable recovery disk because of
 the OEM. I could have fixed this in a few hours myself had I been able to refresh the computer. Google and Windows searches reveal there are loads of people with the same problem. In order to get back to work, the only option I see at this point is to buy
 another copy of Windows 8.1 at $99, which rewards Microsoft for shafting us. <br />
<br />
I have two thoughts: 1. Is there anyone out there capable of gathering us all for a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft? There have to be a lot of people who would join. 2. Having quit Apple for Microsoft 20 years ago and always bought Office as well, I
 doubt I can in good conscience buy another Microsoft product. It's an issue of principle.

            this has also happened to me. While its good to know I'm not alone, its no good to know that I am stuck in this situation with a black screen on start up. So, what can MS do for me?

            <p>Same problem here, and happened after I installed the Windows 8.1 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Long black screen at startup.</li><li>Cannot access PC Settings from charm bar.</li><li>Tried to perform a system refresh, recovery media created by Windows 8.1 is deemed invalid by system refresh tool. I tried with both a thumb drive and a cd.</li><li>Windows update won't update anymore. After it goes through the cycle of downloading and installing and rebooting, It shows a message saying that it's uninstalling the updates it just installed. sometimes it gets stuck in a loop where it repeats that over
 and over. I used the troubleshooter from the control panel and it "fixes" the problem with windows update. W update installs maybe one or two updates and the same thing happens all over again.</li></ol>

            Computer worked fine in the morning, but only black screen on boot up. &nbsp;Was able to dig down through the Repair menus, but as others said, the original OEM Windows 8 disk was deemed invalid. &nbsp;Guessing this is because the computer was upgraded to 8.1. &nbsp;Created
 a recovery disk from another 8.1 computer and that was invalid also. &nbsp;However, the Restore point from a few weeks ago brought it back to working. &nbsp;Have saved all data off it and now plan to install OS over, plus all programs. &nbsp;The reason is that the computer
 is just working enough to get the data. &nbsp;Printers, programs, and general slow down make me not trust it. &nbsp;

            Same problem different circumstances. A few months ago my usb drives started dying (not working) and started trying everything to save the two&nbsp;that was at the&nbsp;time that was working and try to fix the first one. I'm down to one now. I went drastic and went
 for the option for Toshiba to restore to out of the box condition. Then started having the missing partition problem and&nbsp; started tinkering with the diskpart. I new problems crop up like no operating system but was able to burn a iso image disk of my recovery
 disk. I kept getting the can't find needed partition and got drastic and installed windows 8.1 enterprise. I was hoping since I had 8.1 already preinstalled I could recover some how to my personal 8.1; no luck. Then I did notice all the partitions seemed to
 be there despite still getting the errors. I then noticed they were hidden but they also had no letter assigned to them. I did that, but I wonder if I did that too late or that they need to be the exact ones on my recove

            Yes, I'm up for class action. When should we begin? I too have a Laptop rendered useless as a result of an upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1. ASUS has turned a blind eye, and Microsoft has provided no solution for their software cockup. I have no way of accessing
 the recovery partition on my Laptop, and both Microsoft and ASUS offer no workarounds to me getting back the operating system I PAID FOR!!! Please let us gather and sue these ****.

            UPDATE!!! To add to insult, I received my ASUS laptop back a few months ago after hard drive failure with a new installation of Windows 8. I was bloody ecstatic. Obviously, having learnt from my previous error of having installed the Windows 8.1 update,
 rendering my recovery partition useless, I wasn't going to commit the same error, right?&nbsp;Well, one morning I turn on my laptop, and low and behold, I have a blue screen saying, "INSTALLING WINDOW'S 8.1"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; THE&nbsp;DAMNED THING
 SELF INSTALLED and sure enough,&nbsp;screwed up my recovery partition AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are going to be serious problems here!

            I found the certificate when I was looking through all my certificate, found one with matching expiring dates but the names did not match.<br />
I made a backup on the certificate and then tried to delete it and continued my installation.<br />
<br />
I'm now past step 8 of my installation progress.<br />

<h2>            After an update I lost my news feed.</h2>
                    After a windows update I lost my news feed.&nbsp; I don't have any tiles just a blank start page in edge.&nbsp; Edge is working but it doesn't&nbsp; display my news feed.&nbsp; I have my settings on top site and suggested contents.&nbsp; I tried all the solutions I have found
 and I am still lost.&nbsp; When I grew up we used a pencil and paper.&nbsp; Now we have these machines and I am struggling to keep it going.&nbsp; I have 64 bit computer so the remooptimizer wouldn't download.&nbsp; I would greatly appreciate any help.&nbsp; Chester

 that it was the updates that had corrupted my windows 10. &nbsp; The tech tried several things an it still wouldn't work He then decided that it needed a new windows 10 download. &nbsp;After a bit he was able to make enough changes that he was able to download windows
 10. &nbsp; I really appreciate everyones help in my dilemna. &nbsp;I can't say enough thank yous . &nbsp;Chester

    <title>Windows 10 Education version reactivation after hardware change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Education version reactivation after hardware change</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
When I started Uni, I got a free Windows 10 Education version key, which I activated on my computer before the hardware change and it worked fine. Yesterday I fully upgraded my computer and windows is recognizing it as a new computer, saying "We can't activate
 Windows on this device because the product key was already used on another device." After going through troubleshooting, I click on "I changed hardware on this device recently" and it prompts me to log in with my Microsoft account. While I do have a Microsoft
 account, it was not tied to my computer, if I recall correctly, as I was logging in my an account that was provided to me by my Uni, which also has Office 365.
<br />
The question is, how do I go about reactivating the Windows on my current hardware. I still have the key which I got almost a year ago.<br />
<br />

<br />
After trying to add my Microsoft account, I get an error message saying,<br />
<br />
"Oops, something went wrong<br />
We can't add your Microsoft account to this device right now, but it's okay. We'll help you set up, and you can sign in later in Settings"<br />
<br />
I've been getting this for the past few hours. Should I just try again after a few hours or even days?<br />

<h2>            How Do I connect my Xbox360 E HDMI port to my HDTV 5 RCA component ports&#63;  </h2>
                    
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;I purchased a xbox360 E to replace my xbox360 Elite due to the RROD issue.&nbsp; Now I'm unable to connect my xbox360 E to my HDTV because of the port issue mentioned in the title of this thread (I can only use the basic AV connection).&nbsp; I researched
 different connector cables on Amazon and came across numerous posts noting that the HDMI to 5 RCA component cable (which seemed to be my only help) would not work because the cable was only meant to capture a signal from a device that outputs an analog signal
 via HDMI.&nbsp; Not sure how the old xbox360 Elite was able to produce a HD quality&nbsp;connection via the cable that was included in the box.&nbsp; If there is no adapter cable that would work,&nbsp;anyone know what other options are out there? Converter? If so, what kind,
 etc. If anyone here is tech savvy enough to explain this I would appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't believe it is possible to go from an HDMI out on your Xbox 360, to RCA in on your HDTV. &nbsp;I'm sorry.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get past login screen on Windows 10</h2>
                    I had Windows 10 for a while now and this is the first time it has been happening. When I turned on my computer from sleep and sign in to my account, it started loading, but after a while it cuts to black and jumps back to the lock screen image . I try
 to sign in again and the same thing happened. The only way I got past this was by shutting down my computer and starting it up again.

            <p>Honestly not sure what I did, I was chatting with support team and nothing was working but for me after a while the issue was not my computer crashing, it was I would get up to about 1.03 GB and it would not move, kept giving me an error code 0x80073cf9
 All I did was reset the windows store. When I reset the windows store the download really slowed today around 26GB and I though it was going to crash again and with frustration I just left my PC on and went to bed. When I woke up it was download I'm not sure
 if it is lucky but the only advice I can give you is try to restart you store... uninstall another game, install the game you just uninstalled and then try to install "Forza Horizon 3"</p>
<p>this is just to see if it's the actual store having the issue or just a new game being a new game&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll wish everyone luck&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Audio stutters in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryank47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio stutters in windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Multimedia Class Scheduler CPU Usage</p>
<p>I recently did a system restore on my PC, and lately I've been having trouble with my computer's audio. Audio will usually play fine, but when I do something on the computer, like open a folder or a new tab on chrome for example, the audio stutters and lags.
 I checked the DPC latency and CPU usage and, although they are usually within a reasonable range, they both spike when the audio stutters, confirming the earlier observation. Using the performance monitor, I found the culprit to be the MMCSS. When the spikes
 occur, the MMCSS uses between 10% and 30% of my CPU before returning to normal levels (~1%).
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have already tried installing different audio drivers (Realtek v 2.66, 2.67, and 2.68), but the problem persists with each of these. I have also tried disabling networking but the same spikes occur, which makes me think the network throttling of MMCSS
 is not the issue here. I don't think this service should require so much CPU if all it's doing is managing which audio has priority on the CPU, although I could be wrong.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Should the Multimedia Class Scheduler be taking this much CPU, and if not, what steps can I take to fix it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BTW, if it's relevant, I have a 3.4 GHz Pentium 4 processor and 2.5 GB of RAM, so I think my system should have enough resources to handle the processes necessary for audio, as it was able to before.</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi
<b>Ryan,</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Run Fix it for audio problem.</span></p>
<p><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method<span>
</span>2:</span></b><span><br />
<br />
Try to manually uninstall and reinstall the audio driver.<br />
<b><br />
<strong><span>Follow the steps to do that :</span></strong></b>
<br />
<br />
a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, and then, under System, clicking Device Manager. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span><span>‌</span><span><br />
<br />
b. In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to delete, and then double-click the device name.<br />
<br />
c. Click the Driver tab, click delete Driver, and then follow the instructions. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
<br />
<br />
Restart the computer, after restart install the latest audio driver manually and check.<br />
<br />
For more information see : http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly
<br />
<br />
d. To uninstall a realtek audio driver from "Programs and features" Click Control Panel &gt;&gt; Programs and features &gt;&gt; locate the audio driver and remove or disable it. Manually reinstall it by following the steps in the link provided above.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that does not help, you may have to check with the manufacturer as there could be an issue with the hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above information is helpful.<br />
</span></p>

            I have followed the recommended steps, but unfortunately the problem persists. I may have to try a clean reinstall of Windows, or just switch to Ubuntu.

            Update your wireless driver.<br />
<br />
If it is Atheros based as about 3/4 of them are, use this link:<br />
<br />
http://atheros.cz<br />
<br />
If you need more help, let me know. I'm a professional audio systems specialist also and have my own studio here. :) Believe it or not - based on a P4 3.4 GHz just like you and it does everything I could ever need and more, w/ MOTU Traveler.<br />
<br />
I'll make it happen for ya.<br />
<br />
Before requesting further help, uninstall your antivirus in safe mode with tool to do so from the manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Reboot and install MSE.<br />
<br />
Update motherboard bios to latest and also set it to Optimized Defaults.<br />
<br />
If you are using mismatched RAM, physically remove RAM until that is no longer true.<br />
<br />
All RAM sticks must be exactly the same.<br />

<h2>            3D objects</h2>
                    I tried to get rid of the 3D objects folder that appeared on my computer, but I combined it with my documents. Now I have two sections that say documents and have all my documents. When I delete one folder from one, it deletes it from the other. I just
 want the document folder that was originally the 3D objects to be gone. How can I do that?

    <title>Technet Subscription Keys Eligible for Windows 10 Upgrad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tconway  say:</h3>
<h2>            Technet Subscription Keys Eligible for Windows 10 Upgrad</h2>
                    <p>I had a TechNet Subscription prior to it's ending that I used the keys for Windows 7 and 8 on several of my PCs to install an operating system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I replaced a Hard Drive, installed Windows 7 Pro and used one of the keys to activate windows 7 and was successful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notification appeared saying I am eligible for Windows 10 Upgrade and I took advantage of it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Windows 10 did not activate and I am getting the error "Activate failed because this device doesn't have a valid digital entitlement or product key.&nbsp; Error code 0x803F7001."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused.&nbsp; If I am getting the "eligible to upgrade" message before upgrading to 10, how can I be not "entitled" after I upgrade.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, does anyone know if </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; TechNet subscriptions are in fact eligible or not</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If they are, which versions are, i.e., Pro, ultimate, 7, 8. 8.1 etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If there is a route to getting 10 using TechNet keys, does anyone know what it is.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; If TechNet keys are not, should I just drop back to 7 and be done with it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help. </p>
<p>

            <p>I had a similar problem where Music and Video apps would open then immediately lose focus (I.e. minimise). I could return to them but they would immediately minimise again.</p>
<p>I tried using all the suggested Microsoft &nbsp;fixes, including restore. I tried&nbsp;uninstalling video drivers &nbsp;(AMD), changing sharing settings (my music being on a NAS), synching licesnses, uninstalling and re-installing all the apps, re-starting the store, checking
 for missing files, running sfc /scannow.....all to no avail. In the end, out of sheer frustration, I installed Windows6.3-KB2835517-x64, which&nbsp;is the stand-alone installer for the old windows media player. Now the music App works, as does the video app. This
 may be coincidental, but it's worth a try.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Microsoft haven't covered themselves in glory with these type of issues and I'm not sure whether I will be buying windows 9 when it eventually comes out....</p>

<h2>            system restore not working could not access a file</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a major problem with System Restore on Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I restore it goes through the motions then when it eventually restarts I get an error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore could not access a file. With&nbsp;Error code 0x80070005</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't tell me what file it can't access but says it's probably antivirus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've tried it with Norton anti-virus and Firewall disabled and still get the same error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried many restore points and none of them work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found another thread that suggest there could be files quarantined in the anti-virus. I've checked and there are no files in quarantine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found another thread in the windows 7 forums suggesting a read only attribute in the system volume folder. I've checked and there is no system volume folder in widows 8 even when folder settings are set to show hidden and system files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me fix this before I go through the hassle of performing a full factory reset?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fixed it now. Problem was my anti-virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a setting in Norton called 'Norton product tamper protection'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned that off and now system restore was successful.</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />That is not the expected behaviour indeed.
<br />
<br />Sometimes there are glitches in the installation / update process that don't pop up an error message so we end up thinking the installation is all ok when it not the case, which can cause strange behaviors as the one you describe.
<br />
<br />May I suggest that you uninstall Skype, restart your device, re-install Skype and try again?
<br />
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida
