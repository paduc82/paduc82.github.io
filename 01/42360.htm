<h2>            Pixelated band at the bottom of Netflix</h2>
                    Was using the updated Netflix app and noticed a thin pixelated band at the bottom of the screen. Some TVs might crop it out, but it's there. Tested out the same show on the Apple TV and the band was gone.

<p>I've noticed the exact same problem. I'm thinking it's a streaming issue. Since Xbox One has poor streaming performance with Netflix, it displays artifacts like that when struggling to reach the full resolution. Tested several identical shows on PS4's Netflix
 App without any problems...only on my Xbox One. </p>

    <title>Battery wear problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Battery wear problem</h2>
                    I noticed that my battery was lasting less and less since about mid February so I ran the battery report and sure enough the battery was loosing capacity rapidly since then. I figures it had to be a software issue so I ran a reset and it didn't fix anything.
 I even tried the insider preview. I then contacted MS support and the tech tried a bunch of things and basically told me that id have to pay $450 to get it fixed since my warranty had expired. This is definitely a manufacturing/firmware issue since it just
 started very suddenly. I also noticed that <a href="http://www.surfaceforums.net/threads/battery-wearing-for-a-year.20677/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
others are having the same issue</a> and it also started around the same time. Anyone else here have this issue?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50db9d20-d65a-4764-af65-eab13e06a1e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50db9d20-d65a-4764-af65-eab13e06a1e1" /></a>

            <p>I have been using my SP3 hooked up to a monitor for some time and just now when I would have needed field use did I realise that I am at 83% wear (7.4mWh) after 178 cycles!!! This is a f..king cheap shot from MS! Will go extremes to have it fixed free of
 charge! This is abnormal for something I'd paid SGD 1800 combined with keyboard. Degradation started just before the end of warranty and went unnoticed due to desk usage...</p>

            This is basically the same scenario that I am experiencing. They won't do anything but let me pay them $450 plus shipping for a replacement. That is ridiculous. I love the surface products but MS will not do anything for it's customers even though they
 can see that their hardware is the issue. It's super frustrating.

            <p>Just finished MS Singapore support. They say ~SGD 850 (USD 625) will be the battery replacement. Mine deteriorated just outside warranty within 2 months. (Could not apply for extended warranty because I am not a SG citizen or perm. resident) My reply was:
 hahhhhahahahahahaha - that is ridiculous. I will talk every living being out of buying MS products in the future. Will never be a a free beta tester/troubleshooter for anyone's unfinished/unoptimized product. This is totally unacceptable from a company that
 has just paid USD 26 yard for LinkedIn - hope they will not make another Skype success story out of it...</p>

            I'm having the exact same problem. I bought my Surface Pro 3 in November 2014, and the battery was somewhere around 2% wear/98% capacity in March 2016. It then began to degrade very quickly, and is now at about 97% wear/3% capacity. It's literally unusable
 unless it's plugged in. This is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Since Microsoft won't do anything about it, I'm going to end up purchasing some other brand as a replacement, and warning anyone and everyone NOT to buy any Surface products.

    <title>Issues getting windows 98 serial port hardware to work on a windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joey_campbell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues getting windows 98 serial port hardware to work on a windows 7 machine using dosbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi I'm trying to run a piece of hardware (which currently works on a windows 98 machine) to work on a windows 7 enterprise 32 bit machine. The hardware is a KingCycle bike trainer that measures wattage output and connects via the serial port. I've got the
 hardware plugged into the COM1 serial port on the windows 7 machine. The software has been configured for compatibility mode in windows 98. I've checked on the device manager to ensure that the serial COM1 port is working ok and that drivers are up-to-date.
 I've installed DosBox to run the Kingcycle application and I've restarted the pc several times.<br />
</p>
<p>The issue I'm having is that when the software tries to communicate with COM1 it stalls and gives the error 'No Interface Fitted, Error Return Code = (HEX) 8000'. Is there anything in particular in the COM/Port settings that needs to be changed so as to
 sync up with the hardware correctly ? I'm not sure if this setting needs to be changed but currently the Baud Rate is set to 9600.<br />
Any info would be great. </p>

            <p>It may be that the software just will not run correctly on W7, not everything works 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, looking at this article - <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Configuration:SerialPort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Configuration:SerialPort</a> do you have to configure the COM port in DOSBOX first? More here -

    <title>WIndows 10 Photo Viewer RAW Camera Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davewerwinski  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 Photo Viewer RAW Camera Files</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new Sony Mirrorless Camera that has .ARW RAW photo files. Windows 10 Photo viewer says "It looks like we don't support this file format" when I try to open them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is before I bought this new camera, I used a different Sony Mirrorless Camera that had the same .ARW photo files and it worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More details:</p>
<p>Old camera: Sony a6000 (RAW files opened in photo viewer)</p>
<p>New Camera: Sony A7ii (RAW files won't open in photo viewer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />It is indeed a bit strange.
<br />
<br />Be sure that files could be open on another device (no any corrections).
<br />
<br />Try to install the codec pack from here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />For Sony you can find extra drivers: <a href="http://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/www/download/vista_raw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/www/downloa...</a>

<br />Let me know how it goes

</p><p>So update on that - it actually seems to be just an issue with my Microsoft Onedrive. I pulled the files out of the onedrive folder and into lightroom and onto my desktop - and they both can open the files.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you receive an error message that includes the "0x8DDD0018" error code or the "0x80246008" error code, follow the steps in the "Verify that BITS is correctly configured" section to resolve this problem.<br />

Error 0x80200013
<p>BITS can request ranges of updates. However, if the network proxy or firewall device does not support range requests, BITS cannot download updates. Therefore, BITS returns the 0x80200013 error code. When this problem occurs, the %windir%\Windowsupdate.log
 displays the following entry:</p>

<p>To resolve this problem, contact the vendor of the network proxy or firewall device.</p>

That's because you can <strong>NOT</strong> use Windows 7 Home Basic or Starter&nbsp;or Home Premium editions as a Remote Desktop [RDC] host. Look at TeamViewer as an easy to setup and use alternative to remotely access/control a Windows 7 Home Basic or Starter&nbsp;or
 Home Premium machine.</p>

When I boot up my computer I get an error message headed </p>
<p>bdagent.exe - system error</p>
<p>The program can't start because MSVCP100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix the problem.</p>
<p>(The bdagent refers to Bitdefender Security Program)</p>
<p>Bitdefender will not open and since encountering this problem I have some small glitches with e-mails that I suspect could be related to it, e-mails won't delete or screen goes back to home page when I close an e-mail.&nbsp; I have to reboot to delete the e-mails.</p>
<p>Your help will be greatly appreciated, I am 73 yrs. old and I am having great difficulty trying to find this program and knowing how or where to reinstall it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

<p>I have removed and then re-installed my email account[s]. That didn't help.</p>
<p>I completely uninstalled Windows Live Mail and then reinstalled it and that didn't help.</p>
<p>I tried 'restoring my computer' back to a point in which I knew that Windows Live Mail was working correctly, and that didn't help.</p>
<p>Help!&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response:</p>
<p>As I indicated above, I am using Windows 10, and I have tried re-installing Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; Since WLM 2012 is the only version that can be re-installed, I have WLM 2012 on my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not made any recent changes on my computer. And, as I noted
 in my original post, I even tried restoring my computer back to a point in time that everything was working okay.</p>
<p>Note, also that the little 'X' which normally appears to the right of the Deleted and Junk folder names (and allows deletion of items in those folders) no longer appears.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Juzar,</p>
<p>On my original post, I did not indicate that I am getting an error message.</p>
<p>Rather, I simply can not delete anything within Windows Live Mail. Outside of WLF, everything is fine.</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can not delete anything in WLM, including a single email message, a folder, a group of highlighted messages, etc. It doesn't matter if I highlight the message[s] and then press the large red X, or if I highlight an item and press my delete key, or if
 I right click an item, and select delete.</li><li>No error messages are displayed.</li><li>I am running Win 10</li><li>I have completely removed and then reinstalled all my email accounts.</li><li>I have tried the 'repair' utility for WLM.</li><li>I have completely removed (uninstalled) WLM (including all the WLM files in the C:\Microsoft folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I have reinstalled WLM and my email account[s].</li></ul>
<p>Thank you for any help you might be able to provide.</p>

            <p>Juzar:&nbsp; I followed your instructions (above) to the letter.&nbsp; And I made sure that all files relating to Windows Live Mail were completely removed from my computer.&nbsp; I then reinstalled Windows Live Mail, and added one email account.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as I added an
 email account, the problem[s] were the same:&nbsp; I could not delete anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I followed your instructions without uninstalling WLM. But, I did delete WindowsMail.MSMessageStore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when I reopened WLM, and the database was rebuilt, I still can not delete anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for the trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried absolutely everything I can think of.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that I can possibly think of that might have caused this is that this problem started occurring after I received a large Win 10 update earlier this month.</p>

<p>I just discovered that I also can not delete anything from Windows Live Mail which is installed on another (completely separate) computer as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The symptoms are exactly the same on that computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, If I use Outlook.com or Outlook to send/receive my mail, everything is okay.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems are only in WLM.</p>

<p>Juzar, that folder and file belong to a completely different program (Windows Mail), which only works on Windows Vista unless the user has applied an unsupported hack to make it work on later versions of Windows. No changes to this folder will have any effect
 on Windows Live Mail.</p>

<h2>            EU court rules gamers are free to resell digital games</h2>
                    
<p>The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-07/cp120094en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Court of Justice of the European Union</a> has ruled that publishers are legally unable to stop people reselling digital games.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>â€œAn author of software cannot oppose the resale of his â€˜usedâ€™ licences allowing the use of his programs downloaded from the internet.â€</p>
<p>The exclusive right covering the distribution of a copy of a game is â€œexhausted on its first sale,â€ said the ruling.</p>
<p>This means you are legally able to resell downloaded computer games, whether no matter where you bought it and no matter what EULA is associated with the retailer.</p>
<p>The ruling continues: â€œTherefore, even if the licence agreement prohibits a further transfer, the rightholder can no longer oppose the resale of that copy.â€</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What do you Americans think about this?</p>

<p>I am confused too. I guess maybe they could just transfer a license for the game? I don't know how you would go about doing that.</p>

<p>well, i suppose you would sell the product key.. PC games are weird, the only thing that matters is the product key. its basically a code to download a game on xbox.. except you can use it everywhere... I wonder if this means you can download an EU arcade

<p>^^^^^ This was my point. &nbsp;Just saying its legal to sell digital copies of games doesnt mean you can do it. &nbsp;There has to be a system in place in order to facilitate the sale and transfer of license (or whatever)&nbsp;&amp; game and at this point there isnt. &nbsp;And
 in whose interest (other than users) is it to set&nbsp;a system like that&nbsp;up? So other than saying the publishers cant stop you from selling it, I dont see how people are actually going to accomplish it at the moment.&nbsp; Long term I like the ruling though.</p>

<br />
Essentially now with GFWL titles only the gamertag the product key was redeemed on can play the game. So if Microsoft do have to allow the reselling of digital products, expect them to change the DRM in such a way where only the purchasing account can play
 it instead of all the accounts on the console.</p>

<p>actually you can play any arcade game on 360. pirating an arcade game is very very easy, but if you are connected to XBL you are banned pretty much instantly. Maybe they won't be able to ban now when this happens?</p>

<p>I never buy anything digital, obviously I have to buy things like Minecraft, Dawnguard and Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD because they don't come as a hard copy, but I would never buy a full game on games on demand if it is in the shops.</p>

<p>Same goes for music too, I'd rather buy an album as a CD rather than an MP3</p>

<h2>            5 audio devices in device manager -- 4 Nvidia HD Audio and 1 Realtek HD Audio</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, <br />
I use Win 7 64-bit on my vaio laptop (VPCF11M1R/H). The laptop has <br />
NVIDIA geForce GT 330M graphics. I use the latest video driver from <br />
NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Win7 device manager lists 5 audio devices -- 4 Nvidia High Definition <br />
Audio and 1 Realtek High Definition Audio, these 4 devices appeared <br />
after the video driver installation. My question is -- why are there <br />
4 audio devices from NVIDIA, why is the quantity equal to 1 (device <br />
with HDMI support)? Please explain. And what is each of 4 devices <br />
responsible for?</p>
<p>Thanks, Artem.</p>

</p><p>Hello. After rebooting my computer, Windows thinks that my screen (monitor) is bigger than it is. I cannot see the right side and bottom of my screen and it does not give me the ability to move to the unseen portions. I cannot see the minimize/maximize buttons

<p>Corrupt system files (which you discovered with SFC) must either be replaced individually or you must do a system repair/upgrade<span>using the genuine Windows Vista
 Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and Iâ€™d like to make sure weâ€™ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to analyze&nbsp;the SFC's CBS.LOG&nbsp;to find the problem file(s) using
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files that couldn't be corrected here (with the information about them) so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).&nbsp; Do you have or have access somehow to a genuine
 Vista Installation Disk?</span></span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Installing vista on a new computer&#63;</h2>
                    Hi folks.<br />
I've been searching around these forums but i can't seem to find a previous post containing the same situation.<br />
<br />
My problem is as follows:<br />
I'm buying a new computer in a few days and it's being assembled without any OS on it. Now, with this current computer i bought and installed Vista Home Premium 64.<br />
Once the new computer arrives, can i use my allready purchased Vista copy on the new computer or will the fact that it's allready installed and in use on another computer computer (owned and used by myself only) complicate this?<br />
<br />
From reading these forums i gather that it is possible to reinstall an OS on a computer if you've changed some hardware, by using the telephone registration option. But in my case it's a completely new computer.

            It depends on whether it is an OEM or Retail&nbsp;Licence for&nbsp;Windows.<br />
<br />
An OEM&nbsp;Licence&nbsp;for Windows is tied to the original computer it was installed on,&nbsp;for the life of that computer.<br />
<br />
When that computer dies, the Licence dies with it.<br />
<br />
If Retail Licence, you may transfer it to another computer.<br />
<br />
BUT, it can only be installed on one(1) computer at a time.<br />
<br />
Even if it Retail and you move the Licence, you will have to do a Phone Activation, as you will probably get a message saying "Product Key already in use", which it is by the older computer, where it is now installed..<br />
<br />
And you will have to format the old Drive.
