                    <p><span>I have not long installed Windows 10 pro (over the top of Windows 8 pro) and having followed the setup procedure for configuring for use in the UK, I found the keyboard kept defaulting to US. I went to settings&gt; Time and Language&gt; Region

<p>I appreciate you‚Äôve put in time and effort to help resolve the issue I‚Äôm currently experiencing in windows 10. However, if you revisit my original post and read againt, you will note that I have already followed the path suggested in the link you sent, to
 the ‚ÄúRegion and Language‚Äù page. If you then look at the attached graphic supporting the text you will also note that, when I arrive there, the page is blank, there is nothing to click on or highlight: no buttons, no boxes, no grayed out areas‚Ä¶ nothing?</p>
<p>But thanks anyway.</p>

<p>Okay. So this article refers to the ‚Äúlanguage bar,‚Äù which it says is found either on the desktop, or the task bar. As I have nothing that relates to a language bar (whatever that may be?) on my desktop (every item on it is known about and put there by myself),
 I‚Äôm assuming therefore, that it‚Äôs the popup menu activated by clicking on the group of letters ‚ÄúENG‚Äù displayed far right on my task bar? The popup is in three parts: the first reads ‚ÄúENG English (United States) US keyboard‚Äù which, despite being constantly
 reset to UK, the system always defaults back to, whenever I reboot my machine or even sometimes while it‚Äôs in general use, (it‚Äôs through this action that I became aware of the current problem). The second part reads ‚ÄúENG English (United Kingdom) United Kingdom
 keyboard‚Äù and the third reads ‚ÄúA (with a symbol next to it) Language preferences.‚Äù If you click on the third item, it‚Äôs a shortcut and does indeed take you to the settings, region and language page, which as we know already, is my current problem, because
 it‚Äôs empty. Having said that, assuming my assumptions so far are right, then this article isn‚Äôt about my problem, it‚Äôs basically about the language bar being missing, which clearly in my case, it isn‚Äôt. In order to help you help me further, perhaps I should
 reiterate that I installed windows 10, less than 4 weeks ago, on top of windows 8.1. However, I don‚Äôt think that would necessarily be the cause of the problem as, as far as I‚Äôm aware, during the setup of both systems, both were initially configured to English,
 English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your endeavors, they‚Äôre much appreciated.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />try a command 
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth 
<br />If it will not help seems it will be better to reinstall Windows.
<br />I hope you did not use any optimization programs.

<p>Thanks for your response. I had a sneaking suspicion in my water that having tried your first suggested solution, that didn't solve the problem, I would resort to reinstalling the dreaded Windows 10. I did it with some reluctance, knowing I would only be
 inheriting, not necessarily the same problems, but definitely problems. And I did. Only three attempts, this time, at downloading something reasonable though; with the least amount of headaches. If it wasn't for the Intel CPU, I purchased for the latest machine
 I have built, demanding I install Windows 10, I wouldn't have bothered. Flaky, doesn't even start to describe it; if Boeing put together aircraft the same way Microsoft put together windows, they would never have got off the ground and gone out of business
 years ago!</p>
<p>
</p><p>B ut as I say, thanks for your time.</p>

<h2>            No Sound from the game GTA V on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently finally got GTA Five on my Windows 10 Laptop and after installing it I found that there is no sound in the game (except the Rockstar Game Loading Screen) and the game play is excellent but there is no audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop has Directx 12 and unfortunately I just found out GTA V is built only for the Directx 11 or 10. I am super sad since I waited ages to get GTA V and a good laptop and now this sound issue is very depressing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop is an: <strong>MSI GT73VR-6RF</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nvidia GTX 1080</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;32 GB RAM</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Directx 12</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to downgrade to Directx 11 or can I run both 12 and 11 at the same time? Could there be any problems for my PC by downgrading to Directx 11, don't want to mess anything up as its a pretty costly laptop ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your assistance in advance&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modified the title from <em>***I just installed GTA V on my PC for the 1st time, only the sound doesn't work as I have Directx 12 and the game is only for Directx 11 or 10. Should I downgrade, or what is the solution***</em></p>

<p><span>Hi Aunkhan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow
 down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Was the game installed from the Steam?</span></p>
</li><li>

 operating system am I running</span></a></strong>‚Äô to provide the details.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Replacing graphics card will not help in retaining DirectX version, Windows 10 has DirectX 12 pre-installed on it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the game has been installed from the Steam, then navigate to the location
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GTAV or Grand Theft Auto-V\Direct X</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Run the DirectX setup from there and see if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, regarding the issue with the sound, I would suggest you to check with the in-game settings for sound and you may also refer the article
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026994/windows-10-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Fix sound problems in Windows 10</span></a></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please get back to us for further assistance on this issue. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Muralidhar,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Firstly thank you very much for your reply.</span></p>
<p>1. The games are not installed from Steam, all are from external hard disks.</p>
<p>2. My Windows Version is <strong>1803 Build (OS Build 17134.829)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The in-game settings for sound are alright and showing no issues. Graphics wise all games are very good and smooth in all game play working fine no problems, except the audio isn't there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was under the impression these Directx things are just some software type things which could be downloaded easily, hopefully not hardware which needs to be replaced as that is out of the question (considering I already spent almost $4000 on the laptop
 itself) ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can a windows run two Directx versions like 11 and 12 at the same time ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I doubt the real problem has to do with DirectX. Win10 comes with DX9,10, &amp; 11 as well as DX12, and it's not</p>
<p>something that you down or upgrade. </p>
<p>Games determine which DX files they use, not Windows, and many games use both DX9 and DX10\11. A lot of more recent games</p>
<p>only use DX11 or DX12 (not many games using DX12).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this instance Windows probably has no idea what the source of the problem is, only that Direct X is involved, as it is with all games.</p>
<p><em>- </em>If you have already reinstalled DirectX as <span>Muralidhar suggested, you should also</span> update Win10&nbsp; to 1903. Some recent games
</p>
<p>require Win10 to be up to date, (but they are generally more likely to not launch if Win10 is not up to date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disc based version of GTA5 does not have a DX installer in the games folder as it does in Steam. There is one on the disc though.</p>
<p>To verify if DX is up to date you can run the<em> Direct X Web Installer</em>, but if there is a suspected corrupt DX file you may need to reinstall</p>
<p>DirectX using the<em> Direct X Redist (June 2010)</em>, as this overwrites all DX files, replacing any corrupt files</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"1. The games are not installed from Steam, all are from external hard disks."</span></em></p>
<p>- This is likely the main problem. Games often develop issues when they are copied to another HDD rather than being</p>
<p>installed properly, as they loose a number of connections created with the Windows they were installed with originally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rockstar use several tools as part of their extended DRM system, so it's also possible one of them may be blocking the sound because</p>
<p>the game is not properly installed on your machine from a legitimate source (retail disc, Steam, or other on line game retailer).
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"(considering I already spent almost $4000 on the laptop itself) ? "</span></em></p>
<p>-&nbsp; (assuming the external HDD you copied from is not one you have from your previous machine,
</p>
<p>or previous Windows install, ie- you didn't buy it)....</p>
<p>It seems you have enough money to purchase the game and install it properly then. Or if you purchased and installed the</p>
<p>game on another machine, reinstalling it may fix the audio issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>"these Directx things are just some software type things "</em></span></p>
<p>That is correct. Here is a list of most the game related DirectX files you should find in your Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You will find all the DirectX files in the Windows<em>\System 32 </em>&amp; sysWOW64 folders.
<br />
</p>
They are in alphabetical order and will start with <em>d3dx9 - 24 &gt; 43 </em>. Then
<em>d3dx10 - 33 &gt; 43</em> &amp; finally <em>d3dx11 - 42 &gt; 43.</em><br />
<p>There should also be - <em>d3d9, d3d10 and d3d11</em> (among others).<br />
These come before the <em>D3Dcompilers-33&gt;43+47.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio - X3DAudio1_0 through 7 &amp; Xaudio2_0 through 9</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>XInput &amp; dinput </em>are DX files used by controllers.</p>
<p>- Win10 currently has only two d3d 12 files. One in System 32,and SysWOW64 .<br />
- There are a few more DX files, but I don't know what they are used for.</p>

<h2>            system administrator in windows 10</h2>
                    is it true that windows 10 is designed with a system administrator with full and total rights to the os and is able to make any kind of change as well as override changes I make?&nbsp;

            Hi CRULF, 
<br />
<br />If your PC is part of a domain (Company machine), then that would be true. Theoretically a system admin would have rights to make changes via GPO (Group Policy) amongst other things. 
<br />
<br />However, if you‚Äôre PC is a stand alone personal use machine, you are the admin. No one else should have access to your PC. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, let me know!
<br />- C

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Yes, if you're talking about built-in administrator, it have all the rights to control and manage your system. It can override changes made by standard users or other normal administrator accounts.
<br />

<p>No, there is no such account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>user</em> account with highest permissions is called Administrators. There are many&nbsp;<em>system</em> accounts with superior permissions, either because they perform functions that users don't need to perform or because they act as a backstop in case
 the Administrators account is hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system of user permissions built into Windows follows standards that go back to the beginning of the PC industry. They are designed for maximum security.</p>

<p>I appreciate the feedback and please excuse my lack of knowledge pertaining to computers.&nbsp; Can you just answer this.&nbsp; I have a laptop for home use only.&nbsp; I surf the internet, check email, manage photos and listen to music.&nbsp; that's it.&nbsp; no additional programs,
 I never venture into command area and try to configure in a custom way, nada.&nbsp; I don't recall where I was but I got curious when I saw the option to view accounts and selected it and listed was my local account, my admin/Microsoft account and a third titled
 SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR.&nbsp; I didn't create so I thought maybe if was a windows feature.&nbsp; is that possible? I'm asking because I am at my wits end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>my passwords stopped working last week and even when I change them hours later I get the message that they are incorrect.&nbsp; my webcam came on by itself for 20&nbsp; minutes.&nbsp; my iPhone started forwarding calls so my phone stopped ringing and went straight to voicemail.&nbsp;
 my incoming trusted email addresses messages started appearing in my spam folder instead of my inbox like usual.&nbsp; so ive been missing important emails.&nbsp; changing passwords, two factor auth.&nbsp; codes, clean installs, checking with Microsoft, apple, my router
 company my wifi (yes there is a wifi device I cannot account for listed ) and its like everyone is afraid to tell me the truth as to why all of this is happening out of the blue.&nbsp; two weeks ago I didn't even know you could remotely access someone's computer
 from anywhere.&nbsp; id never heard of backdoors and the like. &nbsp;</p>
<p>if you have any suggestions for me moving forward i'd love to hear them .. could all of these developments be the work of a virus or malware or or or what? man this sucks. thanks for the feedback .</p>

            Well that sheds some more light on the issue. So there is a built in administrator on your machine, whether it‚Äôs enabled or not is your decision. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs your account though... no one else has access to it. 
<br />
<br />Cllick start and type ‚Äúthis pc‚Äù - right click on it, and click manage. 
<br />
<br />Once there, expand Users and Groups, and then click on Users. 
<br />
<br />You should see it in there. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />- C

<p>Your computer sounds like an attacker's playground.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your computer is seriously messed up and you don't know where to begin to fix it - and you don't backup - you have two choices: 1) call in a professional; and 2) start over from the beginning, i.e., a clean install. For someone lacking in knowledge,
 calling in a professional is the wisest choice. To do a clean install the right way, avoiding mistakes and unwise choices along the way, you'll need some technical knowledge which you can certainly learn with enough research, but do all that&nbsp;<em>after</em>
 your computer is free of malware and working properly again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- There are dozens of system and user accounts built in to Windows, each with a specific set of permissions. That's because Microsoft follows the principal of least permissions, a PC industry standard whereby computer accounts have specifically defined
 purposes and receive only the permissions needed for their purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Every time you go on the internet there are thousands of people all over the world who are trying to break in to your computer. You can't stop them. The most you can do is to make it so difficult and inconvenient to successfully attack your computer that
 they give up and look for an easier target.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The industry-standard system of user and system accounts is one of the many defenses that you have to protect yourself. Attackers possess exquisite knowledge of computers. If there were an account that allowed complete and unfettered access to every possible
 function of a computer, and I was an attacker, I would attack that account and you would never know it.</p>

    <title>All Menus in Windows 7 Are Aligned Right After Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            All Menus in Windows 7 Are Aligned Right After Windows Update</h2>
                    
<p>After installing recommended updates to Win7 via Windows Update, all menus are now&nbsp;lining up&nbsp;with the right side of the menu title instead of the left side. For instance, instead of the left edge of the File menu lining up under the 'F' in File, the right
 edge lines up under the 'e' in File. This is occuring in every program except Firefox and it's annoying. Any ideas for a fix would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

</p><p>To use HDMI as Audio Output customer needs to right-click standard Windows Audio icon in tray and chose "Output Devices" there, signing HDMI as default output device. Some players need to be restarted for changes to take effect.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Noah,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. What is the complete error message you are receiving?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do you remember making any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be related to any recent software or hardware changes on the computer. Sometimes you may face this issue, if there is a memory leak in one of the programs installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Let‚Äôs try the following steps and check:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to check in Event Viewer for logs regarding what is causing the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> on the desktop screen and select
<strong>Event Viewer</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>b. This will bring up the <strong>Event Viewer box</strong>. Click to open the event viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the left pane, expand out <strong>Windows Logs</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on <strong>Application log</strong>. Highlight the first event in the log and use your arrow keys to scroll down. Most of your event will be Information. You may see Yellow Warnings or Red Errors. If you see a red error, you can double click
 on it to bring it up and copy the contents to a document.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try to run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Double click on <strong>troubleshooting</strong> and click on <strong>
view all</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click <strong>System Maintenance troubleshooter</strong> and hit <strong>
next</strong> to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Follow the on screen directions to complete the process. Once it is done, close all windows and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the <a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Acer support website</a> and try installing the Windows 8.1 version of chipset, graphic and other device drivers and check.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try running the Windows Updates and install all the available updates including the optional driver/ firmware and check.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may try to boot in Safe mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.<strong> </strong>Right click at the bottom left of the desktop and select Run.<br />
b.<strong> </strong>Type <strong>msconfig </strong>and hit Enter.<br />

d.<strong> </strong>Place a check mark on the <strong>Safe boot option</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e. Click <strong>apply </strong>and then <strong>ok. Restart
</strong>the computer<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: You need to uncheck the safe mode option by performing the above steps to boot in normal startup.</span></p>

<p>Mark B.<br />Alright! So here's the thing David, actually there's some instances same happening&nbsp; from our customer that they can't redeem the code, we find out that, this consistently happening when you're still subscribed to Xbox live gold. so what we're suggesting is kindly wait your Xbox live gold to be expires so you may able to reddem your code.&nbsp;<br />11:21</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Windows 10 contains a Telemetry service that reports back to Microsoft on hardware usage/errors etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Census is part of that Telemetry Framework and t<span>he process is only gathering data on your usage of the webcam</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want restrict this access to your webcam, go to Settings - &nbsp;Privacy &nbsp;- Camera and uncheck the option 'Let apps use my camera hardware'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or to specifically restrict this process scroll down the "Choose&nbsp; apps that can use my camera' list and uncheck "Feedback' hub', this will limit the data being sent back to MS Community and should free up your Webcam . . .</p>

    <title>Windows 10 not recognizing existing homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgia007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not recognizing existing homegroup</h2>
                    <p>I have a new laptop which is running Windows 10. I already have a PC, 2 other laptops and 2 printers operating on a Homegroup. Even though my new laptop is connecting to the internet via the wireless router, it is not seeing the existing Homegroup. I ran
 the troubleshooting but it found nothing and no&nbsp;Homegroup. The new laptop can&nbsp;not be seen by the other computers either.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have checked that the following services are running as instructed in an earlier post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DNS</p>
<p>Homegroup Listener</p>
<p>Homegroup Provider</p>
<p>Peer Networking Grouping</p>
<p>SSDP Discovery</p>
<p>UPnP Device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked. At this point, the new laptop is useless if I can't print or share information.</p>

            <p>I followed the instructions above but the windows 10 laptop still does not see the homegroup. I then deleted the new homegroup on the PC, shutdown the PC and created the Homegroup with the windows 10 laptop but the PC&nbsp;doesn't see this homegroup. Does it
 matter that the existing PC and laptops are running&nbsp;windows 7?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>no it does not matter about the home groups being on different systems what does matter is you create the connection then restart all devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first check you have the correct printer drivers installed on your laptop, then check the port being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check you have turn on the correct sharing settings and homegroup is add to the windows firewall&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>disconnect your network connection on laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>restart your laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>then reconnect and then restart once more to refresh the networks adapters dns memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then your home group should be viewable and you should see the printer then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another wise check your Ip address and the point of where your routing thru. ie Modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when all else fails connect a network cross over cable and manually set the ip address on PC and laptop see if its a network adapter issue.</p>

            <p>Hi...I did this last week...</p>
<p>Make sure of course @ least one other PC is running with Homegroup working and you obviously know the password.</p>
<p>When you go to 'Control panel' and&nbsp; select 'Network and sharing' &nbsp; What does it say under the 'Home group title?...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ready to create?</p>
<p>or has it detected a home group already</p>
<p>What happens when you select that {with another system running}?</p>
<p>Have you gone into 'Advanced sharing options' and enabled everything?</p>
<p>I need more info&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks.</p>
<p>also...when you go to 'This Pc'&nbsp;&nbsp; on the left pane under 'Networks' are all computers recognized?</p>

<p>Does it matter that the existing PC and laptops are running&nbsp;windows 7?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It might explain the problem.&nbsp; It seems W7 is not so dependent on IPv6 connectivity as W10 and if it does want to use it ISATAP may be functioning correctly.&nbsp; (I have yet to be convinced that ISATAP is working properly under W10.)&nbsp; Then that could imply
 your W7 systems could see W10 but it could not see them.&nbsp; Both the HG and its troubleshooter ignore these details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check that you can meet the HG networking requirements use&nbsp; PowerShell&nbsp; Get-NetConnectionProfile. &nbsp; You need to see&nbsp; NetworkCategory : Private&nbsp; and&nbsp; IPv6Connectivity : LocalNetwork (or better) or you will be wasting your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then check to see if that connectivity is actually working. &nbsp; tracert&nbsp; -6&nbsp; would be a hopeful indicator (provided ICMP is allowed).&nbsp; Then you could try the HG troubleshooter (and ignore its suggestion about checking Network connectivity.&nbsp; Doing that lets
 you keep NetworkCategory : Private even if it really isn't.)</p>

            They are set up in my family profile and I have restricted his content but he can still get to Game Pass and preview and install mature games.&nbsp; He may not be able to play them once installed but it doesn't stop the game preview video or installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I figured this out a bit more.&nbsp; I needed to set my sign out restrictions and then actually be signed out of my profile.&nbsp; When in my son's profile I then only see a limited amount of games, the previews don't play and he can't install.&nbsp; I just need to get
 better at signing out when I'm done.&nbsp; Thanks for your assistance.

<h2>            windows xp add or remove programs tool does not work</h2>
                    I have tried a variety of things like installing malwarebytes and doing a full scan. I deleted all the viruses then put my computer on safe mode but it still is not working. I go to setting, control panel then click add or remove programs. then a window
 pops up saying: Windows cannot find ................ make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search a file, click the start button, and then search. Someone please help, it seems impossible to fix it because everything that people tell
 me to try does not work.

            You need to tell us exactly what the error message says (unless it really says):<br />
<br />
Windows cannot find ...........&nbsp; make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search a file, click the start button, and then search.
<br />
<br />
For example, you might see something like this:<br />
<br />
Control Panel<br />
Windows cannot find 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe'.&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search.<br />
<br />
Is that what you are seeing?<br />

            This is a common problem where the rundll32.exe file seems to have been quarantined (effectively deleted) by your unspecified antivirus/antimalware application on your system of unspecified make and model with unspecified XP version and Service Pack.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" always suggest running the System File Checker (sfc /scannow) for this problem, but let me assure you with 100% certainty that they do not know what they are talking about and SFC will not replace a missing or
 corrupted rundll32.exe file.<br />
<br />
There is a copy of the file you need on my SkyDrive you can download to replace your missing file.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called
<b>rundll </b>when the file name really needs to be called <b>rundll32.exe</b> (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />

            Depending on your browser, you want the one called:<br />
<br />
rundll32&nbsp; <br />
<br />
or rundll32.exe<br />
<br />
There's only 150 files - I think I have done stuff like this before.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday, the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" will learn to use SkyDrive.&nbsp; It's their stuff - you would think they would know how to use it.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when you find the file on Jose's skydrive, then you select it, then go to the top blue bar and there will be a download button, click it, save the file to your desktop, then go to your desktop, right click and choose properties, unblock, and now you can
 copy / paste into the folders mentioned by Elder L. </p>

<h2>            movie maker won&#39;t save my movie past 38&#37;</h2>
                    <p>please help!</p>
<p>I've used movie maker before with no real issues I couldn't figure out.</p>
<p>I have worked for hours and hours and hours, editing videos and setting them to music of my daughter's entire 1st year of life. I have saved the project, as I have gone in and edited 100's of times. but I'm finally done and want to save the movie and burn
 it onto a dvd. I went out and purchased dual layer dvd's because it's 2hrs 25min long. but I have tried to save it REPEATEDLY and it just keeps stopping at 38%. no error message or anything, just never goes past there. I'm about to lose my mind. what can I
 do? is there a way to burn it onto a dvd without saving it? I have tried saving it "recommended for this project" as well as to "burn cd or dvd". makes no difference. what can I do?????</p>

========================================<br />
Large complex projects are prone to causing problems.<br />
If you create several smaller projects and save each <br />
one in the .wmv movie format in a folder on your hard <br />
drive you can then import the collected .wmv movie clips <br />
into DVD Maker and each one will become a Scene <br />
(Chapter)...you can have up to 18 Scenes. <br />
<br />
If your OS does not include DVD Maker there are other <br />
options...let us know if you need that info.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what your Windows Version and Movie <br />
Maker version are but the following articles offer some <br />
good advice.<br />
<br />
How do I split a complex project into smaller ones? <br />

            <p>so I sat down to split up my project and try it that way...</p>
<p>I started, and in my smaller project - the videos were going black. like the 1st "block" of the video clip played fine, and then the screen would turn black - though you could still hear the audio. and if you were looking at the clips themselves, where the
 screen would turn black - the clip was kind of grayish. I don't know how else to explain it.</p>

=============================<br />
Just wondering...have any of the source <br />
files (photos, video clips, audio clips) <br />
been moved, deleted, renamed? Are they <br />
all saved in a folder on your local hard <br />
drive?<br />
<br />
I can only guess that you might need to <br />
update your video driver.<br />
<br />
And it's also possible that your source <br />
files are not fully compatible with Movie <br />
Maker.<br />
<br />
Many formats are reportedly compatible<br />
with the various versions of Movie Maker<br />
but the most reliable choices are:<br />
<br />
Photos -&nbsp; bmp, jpg<br />
Video -&nbsp; wmv<br />
Audio -&nbsp; wma, wav<br />
<br />
Also...you might find some help in the <br />
following Movie Maker Forum:<br />

            <p>no, I didn't move or rename any videos. I actually did that once before, and learned my lesson the hard way - because I got all the errors on my video, but then it let me relocate the videos and I was able to fix it without much issue.</p>
<p>I shut down the computer and went back in the next day, and my original movie file was back to normal, thank goodness. I broke down one portion to make a smaller video... and now I've been trying to save that since last night, it keeps going to 97% and then
 sits there for hours and hours and hours.</p>
<p>how would I go about updating my video driver? </p>
<p>and is there a way to just transfer my movie onto a dvd, without actually saving it first? at this point, I don't even care if it's saved on the computer. I just want this done. I put so much time and effort into this video... I cannot imagine losing it
 all... and this is becoming ridiculous, I don't even know what to do anymore.</p>

=======================================<br />
Yes it is getting complicated and I don't have the answer <br />
for you.....all I can do is offer general ideas that may or <br />
may not solve the issue.<br />
<br />
What is the duration of your smaller video? It may still <br />
be too large and complex. 15 to 30 minutes might work.<br />
<br />
What are the formats of your source files?<br />
<br />

<p>It possible some programs are still resident in memory. Right click the the Taskbar, and click Task Manager</p>
<p>Go to the processes tab</p>
<p>Filter by Memory and look for any programs you think might still be open. Select the program and click End Task.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue could be clock icon disabled on the </span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Notification Area.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
a. Right Click on task bar and select properties.<br />
b. Click on Customize.<br />
c. Click on Turn System icons ON or OFF.<br />
d. Make sure the option for clock is set to ON.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.<br />
<br />
