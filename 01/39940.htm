<p>To add to what legendaryreward has told you, or perhaps clarify it a little bit, if the DLC you purchased was on the Xbox One, you can look in the "My Games &amp; Apps" app in the ready to install section of the Games tab. You could also look in the game hub
 for the game that the DLC goes with. This link will help you to do that: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/games/view-downloadable-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../view-downloadable-content</a></p>
<p>However, since you've posted this in a 360 support thread, I'm going to assume that you're referring to DLC for a 360 game. In that case, if the DLC does not appear in your download queue, and you're positive that it did not download already, you can find
 it in your download history on your console or on Xbox.com. You can use this link to walk you through accessing your download/purchase history:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/store/view-download-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../view-download-history</a></p>

<h2>            Never buying an XBox again</h2>
                    <p>I have the original XBOX. I have a 360 (first one I had red ringed). I had a day one XBOX One and the disc drive stopped working, it wouldnt read disks. I got the XBOX One S and now it wont work and Ive chatted with support and Ive gone through the steps for fixing it and eventually was told that it has to be repaired. I luckily bought the insurance with gamestop so I can go change it out but I will NEVER buy an XBOX EVER again and will be telling everyone I know to not ever buy one because they OBVIOUSLY &nbsp;can NEVER work properly. Thanks for the hundreds of wasted dollars. I have always stood up for XBOX and been a huge fan but Im done.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Diamond Muiltimedia ATI theater 750 HD TV tuner card not working with Windows 8</h2>
                    I have tried several different drivers and I have tried installing them in compatibility mode and nothing works. In device manager it detects the card and drivers, but WMC doesn't pick up any signal. I spoke to AMD and Diamond MM, but no answers.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to get my tuner to work without having to wait for an updated driver that may never come?</div>

            <p>At what point in time does Microsoft&nbsp;assume&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;of keeping their software compatible with existing hardware. ATI hasn't made that wide a variety of TV tuner products. A $55 upgrade became a $155 upgrade when I decided to buy a TV tuner with a
 hardware MPEG2 encoder to solve&nbsp;this problem. The hardware vendors have to routinely fight to maintain support of their product in an existing software suite (media center) that keeps dropping compatibility for their products.</p>

            Does anyone have an idea when these windows 8 Ati Theater drivers 64bit will be available? I'll probably need them for my Tv-tuner ASUS my cinema ES2-750. I'm waiting for this driver to install windows 8, because I don't want to lose the tv functionality.

            Its absolutely ridiculous that Microsoft supplies a WDM driver for this card threw windows update, but that driver dose not work, I keep getting LOW BITRATE, even with the WDM driver provided by Microsoft, I thought windows 8 was supposed to compatible.
 Makes me wish I never bought it!!&nbsp; oh well complete waist of $45 upgrade&nbsp;!! And WAIST OF MY TIME.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like I'm downgrading to 7

            Oh glad I found this.....banging my head on a brick trying to figure out what was going on. &nbsp;Trying to give the vendors some leeway but it seems no matter how up-to-date I keep my hardware, everything I upgrade windows I am back to buying about 300 bucks
 in new parts. &nbsp;I have the Diamond ATI HD750 tuner card as well. &nbsp;I am very disapointed. &nbsp;If this was the kids of issues expected with this Media Centre release then why not just say Media Centre Not Supported. &nbsp;The whole point/core function of media centre
 is DVR &nbsp;I too just waisted 45 bucks . I have learned my lesson.

            I pulled my old ATI DTV Wonder Pci card out of the dust bin, and it works fine in Windows 7 Ultimate, but not in Windows 8 pro+WMC on the same pc (dual boot). WMC 8 finds the channels and even displays the callsigns but says no signal when you try to watch
 a channel. I wonder if the glitch isn't with WMC in Windows 8. WMC in Windows 7 Ultimate is not much different. Card drivers are the same for both versions.

            <p>I bought this Diamond TV Wonder HD750 PCI-e for my new Windows 8 Build and had few problems when I installed the Arcsoft TotalMedia software, all the software installed correctly except the hardware drivers themselves. After trying compatibility mode,&nbsp;I
 tried again running just the driver install App from the disc at: <br />
"G:\Driver\Win7x64"</p>
<p>&nbsp;bypassing the autoplay installation, but this did not work for me either. The programs would open but would display an error regarding&nbsp;missing TV Tuner Hardware. I was a bit disappointed when I couldn't find Win8 drivers at Diamond or ATI/AMD, but this
 prompted me to check just what the hardware issue was&nbsp;by looking in&nbsp;Device Manager.&nbsp; The hardware was simply&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;getting its drivers&nbsp;from the installation applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;What little info I found&nbsp;suggested some peeps were getting this to work&nbsp;by rolling back
 to the Win7 driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my new PC was a clean install because I upgraded from&nbsp;XP, I had no rollback drivers. Hmm, would a manual driver install work?<br />
&nbsp; I soon discovered the fix was fairly&nbsp;easy, all I had to do was a manual driver installation of the PCI-e device. Using Device Manager, I found the TV Wonder under the Sound, Video, and Game Controllers Heading. Note the TV Wonder is listed as "Hybrid ATSC/QAM
 PCI Express". Do NOT use the "find driver automatically", instead, I browsed to the installation disc to:<br />
"G:\Driver\Win7x64\x64"<br />
and selected the "av88pcie.inf" file.<br />
&nbsp; All ArcSoft Programs and TV Wonder features work great now.<br />
&nbsp; I wrote both Diamond and Microsoft because Microsoft compatibility site doesn't list the Diamond TV Wonder HD750 but does list the 650's. There is 1 AMD/ATI TV Wonder HD750 listed which I marked as compatible with possible manual driver install noting I'm
 using the Diamond version of the TV Wonder. Please, update drivers on site and pass this info along to help others who may have similar issues.&nbsp; So far all ArcSoft software is working great since manual driver install. I will be testing with Win Media Center
 after I get it early April, and will share the results soon after.&nbsp; Good luck and be patient,&nbsp;the fixes and updates will improve as more info is gathered, please share your experiences with Microsoft and the&nbsp;Hardware Manufacturers&nbsp;by whatever means possible,&nbsp;every
 bit of data &amp; feedback received will help resolve most issues that come with the&nbsp;new OS.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you ChuckLEP! I was about to have a hissy fit until I saw your post. While I couldn't find the drivers on the install disk, I did go to Diamond website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.diamondmm.com/tvw650pcie-ati-amd-tv-wonder-hd-650.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.diamondmm.com/tvw650pcie-ati-amd-tv-wonder-hd-650.html</a>,
 downloaded and installed driver for vista, and then from install disk installed the Diamond software. Works great.&nbsp;

    <title>Console Fan Noise Increasing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boydpatterson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Console Fan Noise Increasing</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my Xbox One console since day one in November. &nbsp;In the beginning, it was whisper quiet! &nbsp;Lately, the fan is very audible. &nbsp;I can even hear it when the console turns on in standby mode to check for updates. &nbsp;I know it's not heat related because the
 console would have been in standby mode for over a day and the room was actually rather cool (it's a bonus room in the winter, so we don't keep it hot). &nbsp;The console itself is sitting on an open shelf with nothing blocking the ports.</p>
<p>Has this been a common problem other are experiencing? &nbsp;My console is starting to sound like a 360, and I want the quiet back. &nbsp;Even watching a movie tonight with the sound at a reasonable volume I could still hear the fan running.</p>
<p>I wouldn't think dust would be an issue after just two months, but don't think I can take the cover off the case and blow out the fan without voiding the warranty.</p>
<p>Thoughts? &nbsp;I'm hoping to avoid sending it back to Microsoft for repair.</p>

<p>I bought my xbox one around a month ago. Recently I've been hearing what I assume is my fan squeaking. It hasn't effected my gameplay, but I am worried that it will cause problems in the future. I did not get a warranty with my purchase so I'm not really
 sure what to do.</p>

<p>You should get a 1-year warranty out of Microsoft. &nbsp;For me, the fan just sounds like a ball bearing is not properly lubricated or a fan blade is rubbing something, but I don't want to void my warranty attempt to self-repair. &nbsp;The fan is located just beneath
 the vent on the upper right of the console, so you should be able to pinpoint the problem to the fan by putting your ear up to the vent. &nbsp;The only other thing I would expect could make a noise like that is the disc drive.</p>

<p>I have sort of a similar problem with mine. Mine was quiet for the first few weeks, and then starting making a constant buzzing sound. But I believe this problem is with the disc drive in mine, not the fan, yet it sounds like a fan running.</p>
<p>Reason I think it's with the disc drive is because it only occurs with a disc in, take the disc out and there's absolutely no sound. No problems reading discs or &nbsp;anything, but the noise is annoying.
</p>
<p>Could this be a potential problem with yours? Do you have discs in all the time? Even if i'm not playing the game, it still makes the noise, so I usually take the disc out of i'm watching TV, and it gets pretty loud depending on the game I have in, Battlefield
 4 is the worst/loudest disc I have. </p>

<p>When I purchased mine from gamestop I was told I had to buy any sort of warranty, but I will look into that thank you. The noise coming from it though is a high pitched squeak. It is becoming more frequent everyday and I have heard it while watching netflix
 although a disk was still in so not entirely positive that it is not the disk drive. But like you said I've had no problems with loading or anything, it is just really annoying.</p>

<p>It really sounds like it's coming from the fan. My best guess &nbsp;is like you said mgcoder something rubbing or not lubricated well. I've only had it for a month, but it was collecting some dust so maybe that. Also though I though about this earlier I always
 leave my disc in so I'm going to start taking it out and if the noise stops it's probably the disc drive</p>

<p>I got the exact same problem. Whisper quiet at first, now a audible noise in IDLE. Send it in for repair andI thin they only did a factory reset. Got on chat with a MS employee and she made a case with the advocacy team. Still need to hear from them.</p>
<p>Tired of your bs microsoft. Just fix the console or send me a new one.</p>

<p>@ManipularOrb18 -- sorry, stopped getting e-mail updates on this thread for some reason. &nbsp;I hear the sound whether I have a disc in the drive or not (usually not as I'm all digital so far).</p>
<p>@Silversin88 - Great... now I'm worried about even sending it in for a repair.</p>
<p>@DevilishZeus332 - Sounds like Game Stop wanted to sell you one of *their* extended warranties.</p>

<p>From my chats with Xbox Support and from other posts I've read on the Internet after quite a lot of research, Xbox Support should tell you the console is practically silent, if you put your ear up close you should hear it but other than that you shouldn't
 really know the thing is on. A lot of people say their PSU is louder than the console. If Xbox want you to run your TV through the X1, why would anyone do this if whilst waching TV they can hear the console buzzing/humming etc. Anyone in the right mind would
 just unplug the cable box and watch TV normally, rendering one of the X1's big features useless.<br />
<br />
My console is significantly louder than the PSU and clearly audible from around 10ft. Xbox themselves told me I needed a replacement when I merely queried if it was normal. (I've got a thread on here explaining the awful advanced exchange experience I am having
 and the non existent advocacy team support).</p>

<p>My console should be back next Tuesday. I'll let you guys know. This time I clearly stated that a system reset does not work and they should replace the fan or console.</p>
<p>For the people waiting for a reply from the advocacy team; don't. They don't exist, you will never hear from them.

<p>Like all of you my Xbox one fan is making a lot of noise, but it started since the day i got it on October 2. I noticed most of your Xbox ones where purchased on the day of release and it worked perfectly, so maybe over the time it's the updates that are
 some how *** with the fan. Hopefully it's that so they can fix it as soon as possible, but if it's not, i might be forced to crack open my console and lubricate the fan because it seems Xbox repair doesn't do much to help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If searching for updates hang on a current install,</p>
<p>Make sure and go to Uninstall a program and see which Microsoft Net framework you have installed,</p>
<p>4.5.2 is the most consistent to have installed,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Switch your windows update setting to Never check for updates temporarily</p>
<p>Restart the machine</p>
<p>You can try and install the newest update client manually leave your update settings at Never check for updates until you install this,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the x86 for 32 bit system or x64 for a 64 bit system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install it and restart when prompted too after it does a stand alone search for updates which shouldn't</p>
<p>take too long it took all of 5 seconds "If" the windows update settings are switched to Never check for</p>
<p>updates before running it from the downloads folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once it installs and restarts</p>
<p>You can reset your updates setting to whatever you had prior = Default....</p>
<p>Then manually check for updates.</p>

<p>I believe the solution came from Softpedia and Joel_CS posted it on this thread,</p>

</p><p>I have been looking into the problem further. I have now removed the Microsoft Security Essentials from my computer as I found that the error code was part of that. Subsequently, I now have some new information coming up in the CBS Check SUR logs. See the

<h3> andrewpstanton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hello cannot access camera</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Alienware 17, which used Hello facial recognition quite successfully out of the box. It uses Tobii software for eye tracking.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I do not know whether Hello makes use of Tobii.)<br />
<br />
Windows updated after I set the PC up and all was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days later, Window made a large update, which took quite a long time and several system restarts. After this update I can no longer log-in through facial recognition, as the login screen says it cannot access the camera. The control panel for Tobii
 software also cannot access the camera and says that Tobii is disconnected.<br />
<br />
Hello states it cannot connect to the camera when I try to use the Hello settings.<br />
<br />
I can readily access the camera through other windows apps.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be possible that the drivers have become outdated and incompatible with the new Windows update, therefore, a driver update might be necessary for this. Check out

                    The Windows 10 x64-based System update -&nbsp; KB3081704 - continues to fail.&nbsp; I've attempted the procedures to stop the updating process, rename the update files and then start the updating processes again.&nbsp; That doesn't work.&nbsp; Now, I have a second update

 separately.&nbsp; When I click the button to start the separate installations, the update process hangs up.&nbsp; The settings program also hangs up.&nbsp; After hours of the timeout circle endlessly spinning, nothing ever happens.&nbsp; I can't exit the update process or settings.
 I eventually have to stop the settings program through task manager.&nbsp; I envision a day down the road when security and other updates continue to pile up because I can't get

 when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </span></p>

            Thank you for your response.&nbsp; In answer to your questions, the operating system is Windows 10 (upgraded two months ago) and the anti-virus is Windows Defender.&nbsp; BITS, Cryptographic and Windows Update Services are all running.&nbsp; To be clear, It is just the
 KB3081704 update and the NVIDIA update for GTX260 that fail to update.&nbsp; I have not tried to update after a clean boot, but will do that next.

 is still listed as needing to be installed.&nbsp; Beneath the update message is a blue 'error' message.&nbsp; When I click on the 'error', it shows that the update still needs to be installed.&nbsp; I have been attempting to install this update since July 22 and it is driving
 me crazy.&nbsp; None of the published suggestions work.&nbsp; Why would Microsoft release an operating system that is so buggy?&nbsp; Help!!

            Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I ran the Windows update troubleshooter.&nbsp; It did not identify the problem.&nbsp; I have reset the Windows update components several times.&nbsp; That also did not solve the problem.&nbsp; Frankly, after attempting to install this update
 since the end of July, I would very much like it to disappear.&nbsp; I have three other PCs on my network that do not have this problem.&nbsp; They are receiving new updates that this PC is not because it is stuck on this update.&nbsp; That concerns me greatly because this
 PC is not getting the latest security patches.&nbsp; Please tell me how I can eliminate this update.&nbsp; I just don't have any more time to spend on it.

Still no luck for me.&nbsp; I've attempted to install from Windows install as well as the downloaded file.&nbsp; I've used two different user accounts for these attempts.&nbsp; It will go all the way through the install process.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the install process, it reports
 that an unspecified error occurred with the installation.&nbsp; My W10 installation was an upgrade from Win 7, so apparently I am entitled to this DVD program.<br />

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I would use the media creation tool (USB) to update manually. The W10 version 1511 has been requesting the BIOS be updated on some motherboards. Maybe that is the cause of your error. If you update manually you will get a better upgrade/install experience.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want Windows Update to preform the upgrade. You would get a better response to your inquiry if you post in the forum of the Windows version that you are currently using. Windows 7 or Windows 8.*.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Major changes to the OS, may not always go correctly. Be sure to backup all personal files, purchased software product code keys. Anything you do not want to lose. Here is a link to the media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also helpful information on that page for a manual upgrade.</p>

<p>A clean boot is a procedure used to <strong><em>diagnose </em></strong>some types of problems that may occur in Windows.&nbsp; Despite the impression you may get by reading some of the posts that recommend using a clean boot, it is
<strong>NOT </strong>a cure or fix for anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, a clean boot configures Windows to start using the bare minimum of processes needed by the operating system.&nbsp; If the problem you were experiencing goes away, then you can reasonably infer that the problem was caused by one (or more) of the processes
 that normally start when Windows starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem did go away when restarting in a clean boot configuration, you then re-enable the other processes in a systematic way until you determine which process is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have identified the process causing the problem, you can either delete it (if you don't really need it to start when Windows starts) or research the issue.</p>

<h2>            No login prompt on lock screen &#40;without restarting&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>After updating to the anniversary update on windows 10, I have found an annoying problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I enter the lock screen of my computer, it does not display the login prompt (the "enter password" prompt) and just displays my lock screen image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A way to fix this is by restarting (specifically restarting, shutting down and turning on again doesn't work). The login prompt appears after I do this. However, this is incredibly annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is even more annoying as it prevents me from locking my PC. If I lock it, I wouldn't be able to log into my account again without restarting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can stand having to restart every time I turn on my computer, but locking it has always been something I've done and Winkey-L is a habit. But now, it only makes my experience worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of some way to fix this?</p>
<p />

</p><p>Hi Luke, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve your concern regarding no login prompt on lock screen (without restarting), you might want to try the following troubleshooting suggestions:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Once you are on the locked screen, press any key ( Spacebar, Enter or Backspace ), it should take you to the next page where the system will be asking for your password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Once you've reached the locked screen, press Control + Alt + Delete to get you to the next page where the system will ask for your password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* If still you are unable to go to the page where the system will be asking for your password, we suggest for you to try the next troubleshooting step.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the <strong>System File Checker tool </strong></p>
<p>This<span><span>&nbsp;</span>is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.<span>

            <p>I know pressing buttons normally displays the password prompt - but not anymore. After the update, it only takes of the clock and displays the lock screen image (with the system buttons at the bottom right).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also used sfc scannow and checked the disk for errors to no avail. I've also tried defragmenting and checking for viruses but nothing seems to work. I feel like the only solution is to revert to the previous version of windows 10 or return to a restore
 point.</p>

            <p>I may have a solution that has worked for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Over a month ago, I started having the problem with the login prompt and user not showing up on the login screen. This occurred both on the screen saver lock and when I would boot my computer from a shutdown. When I would Restart my computer, the login would
 show up to log into Windows, but after this, I would again encounter the login not showing up when my computer would lock from the screen saver or if I did a shutdown or put my computer to sleep.
<br />
<br />
As this kept on happening, I did notice that my shutdown would do something weird and my boot-up from a shutdown would not do a proper startup. I was researching all options I could find with this problem and could not find a solution. Nonetheless, I kept on
 running the "sfc /scannow" with no errors, did registry cleanups, uninstalled and reinstalled all my Bluetooth and wireless drivers, etc. The uninstall and reinstall of the wireless drivers temporarily fixed it, but it would immediately go back to the missing
 login.<br />
<br />
I then decided to try stopping the fast boot, given the corky shutdowns and boot-ups. After I turned off the fast boot, this seemed to stop the missing login, in both the boot-up from a full shutdown and when I would lock my computer while it was in Windows.
 And to add to this, the black screen when I would lock my computer went away and started showing my screen image again.
<br />
<br />
To stop the fast boot, click on this link for step by step instructions. <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4189-fast-startup-turn-off-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
I hope this works for others who are having this problem. </p>

<p>I thought I had fixed this issue (almost three weeks later) after a Windows 10 Update by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run services.msc and make sure Credentials Manager service is set to Automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work this webpage had other possible solutions:</p>
<p>https://www.thewindowsinsider.org/fix-windows-10-stuck-welcome-screen-logi/</p>
<p>
</p><p>But realised I was in safe mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, found another fix...</p>
<p>I uninstalled HP Simple Pass. Works fine now.</p>
<p>So the Windows 10 Creator update and compatability with my fingerprint reader must have been causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

            For several weeks I've been able to get to the login screen ONLY IF I did a restart.&nbsp; Yesterday, I tried the recommendation to turn off the fast start and it is now working perfectly.&nbsp; I highly urge anyone with this problem to try this solution before
 anything else.

<p>
</p><p>I had this problem as well. A brand new Windows 10 Dell laptop (SSD, 16GB, i7 - no slouch of a system), with all the latest updates including the 2017 Fall Anniversary Update, in use for less than a couple of days. I'd close the laptop lid, and opening it
 back up would show the splash screen with the two little icons in the lower left.. but no Username or Password prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once when I let it sit there for about 15 minutes, the Username and Password prompt suddenly appeared, but that only happened once. I did a full restart (which took about 5 minutes worth of stuck on "Restarting"...). When it was finished restarting, I had
 the username/password prompt as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the system and checked Services.msc and indeed my Credential Manager Service was running but set to Manual. I don't even know how it got started if it was set to Manual.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed it to Automatic and haven't seen the problem again.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you checked for infection because Java is an infection path and might have had that file quarantined.  
<br /> 
<br />Perform Steps 4, 7 and 11 from this Checklist to turn off Startup freeloaders that can interfere, check for infection with the best tools and then check for damaged System Files. <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not sufficient do the rest of the step to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> If that doesn't help then I'd run a Repair Install by installing Media Creation Tool to choose Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place.  It also advances you to the newest version which you need anyway, and by the most stable method.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

Did you re-install the sdbus.sys driver?&nbsp; The newest crash was related to <span>
Broadcom Wi-Fi Drive.&nbsp; It is on the same bus as the sdbus driver so I am wondering.<br />
<br />
I would re-install the sdbus driver and the bcmdhd63.sys (broadcom)<br />

<h2>            ARABIC language characters</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Hi,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I found that the ARABIC language characters isn't identified in the YOUTUBE application, when ever there is a video with Arabic characters it comes in unrecognized characters,
 I think you need to add the Arabic language characters to the languages in X-BOX YOUTUBE.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Same thing with the search on YOUTUBE , the Arabic language characters isn't available to use it in search.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Thanks.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Profile problems with USB drive.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fma wrath 2069  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profile problems with USB drive....</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I have a USB dive that I have used for around 3 - 6 months now. &nbsp;I have always just loaded my profile on whatever console when I get to where ever I am going so if I go to a friends house I automatically load my profile on their xbox and when I leave
 I transfer it back to the USB dive. &nbsp;(currently my firend has my HDD for a game that he is playing so I have had to play off my USB for a day or two now...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have it partitioned for xbox use for 2.5 gigs and the rest for regular use even though there is usually very little on it if anything. &nbsp; Recently I have been having a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I transfer my profile off my xbox the gamer profile instantly corrupts and then I have to recover my gamertag. &nbsp;This has also made a problem because 1 time it signed in and then corrupted so now a couple of my achievements are out of order (I
 have had this happen on like Civilization Revolution) and I do not want xbox to GS reset me because the gamertag glitched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happened was I was playing offline since I hadn't gotten my router yet and my computer was uploading files to my website and was going through Dante Must Die difficulty on DMC4 and finishing the other difficulties with S ranks..... &nbsp;I had gotten all
 the missions done on every difficulty up to S ranks and connected my xbox up so I could connect to xbox live. &nbsp;It said there was a problem which my modem does have a problem swapping electronics and I have to reboot it and do a connection test on the xbox
 for it to connect the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do this and when it says the connection is good I proceed to try and sign in and the gamertag says it is corrupted again so I recover. &nbsp;I notice that my acheivements were what they were before I got the acheivements an hour or two prior on DMC4. &nbsp;I went
 to go play bloody palace because I didn't want to play the story anymore and cleared it after a couple hours.... &nbsp;(at this point have connected to xbox live once but storm came so internet went out....)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I decided to do some red orb mining since I used holy waters and health items on the hell or hell mode and dante must die mode and I like to have full stock in items... &nbsp; When I exited out of the game it gave me the acheivements that I lost except
 for a couple which were play specific missions like mission 11 and mission 20 on certain difficulties.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my first question is what is the deal with my USB always corrupting my gamertag (I also have reformatted it and reconfigured for xbox.... still no change)</p>
<p>and my second question is do I need to contact XBL and have them adjust my acheivements so that I dont get banned because my gamertag glitched.....</p>

<p>The obvious thing to try would be to try another USB stick and see if the problem continues. If it does not then you know your old USB stick was the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However it is worth pointing out that If a console is banned, or flagged to be banned, any data written on it will show as corrupt on 'clean' consoles. So if you are using your profile on a console that is set for a ban, that could explain the continual
 corruption.</p>

<p>Well I talked to xbox and they promised me that my xbox and profile would not be banned from an achievement being unlocked out of order if it was a legitimate glitch. &nbsp;I also tried later today using the same usb drive and now it works.....</p>

<p>So a couple things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A local gamertag gets flagged as corrupted if it's been recovered at another console. If you haven't already, I recommend you set a password on your gamertag to prevent others from recovering it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A gamertag and save game files are also corrupted by banned XBOX consoles. You'll find out if your console is banned once you reconnect it to The Internet. You won't be able to sign into live with it.</p>
<p><br />
By the way, you're posting from two different gamertags...</p>

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />Can you please try this:
<br />
<br />Right click in your C drive and choose New - Folder
<br />
<br />Can you successfully create a new folder in the root of C
<br />
<br />Windows 10 for some unknown reason does not like us to save files to just the C drive
<br />
<br />It should allow you to create that new folder and then save files to that folder, but not to the actual C Drive       
        </p>

            <p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp;May I know the Fixit you have run?<br />
2.&nbsp;Are you aware of the changes made to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;Which is the antivirus application installed&nbsp; in the computer?</p>
<div>4.From which application&nbsp;are you&nbsp;trying to preview photos. Is it using Windows Photo Viewer or Windows Live Photo Gallery ?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>You may follow the suggestions mentioned below and check with the issue.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Perform clean boot using the suggestions mentioned in the following link and check with the issue.</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>NOTE: After you check the functionality in clean boot configure Windows to use Normal startup using the step 7 suggested in the above mentioned link.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:<span>&nbsp; </span></strong>The error is generally caused by certain codec’s. Hence I’d first suggest you to&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>uninstall</span></a></span><span>
 the codec pack from the computer and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span></div>
<div><strong>Method 3: Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7 and check.</strong></div>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My gamertag is Gokus Homie, I was playing Gears of War 2 with my friend, and we ran back toward spawn, I heard our teammate say "Wow Gokus Homie isn't even helping, I guess he doesn't want to be on xbox anymore." That was the
 final round of the game, and while searching for the next match, I was kicked off xbox live momentarily. I'm not an idiot and I understand he IP Flooded me.

<p>What can Xbox do to make sure that doesn't happen again? Ban him? I reported him for tampering, but the enforcement team has never listened to any of my filed complaints. I feel like all of xbox support is worthless, and I have had quite an awful 5 years
 with this company. If I do not see my problem solved in someway, I will be buying a PS4.</p>

<p>Dos attacks are actually done through your internet, not the Live service, so this can happen with a PS4 as well. The enforcement team will investigate any complaints you file against him, but you should also contact your ISP to make them aware of what's
 going on.</p>

    <title>Domain user disappears from Remote Desktop Users Group on reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petelettin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Domain user disappears from Remote Desktop Users Group on reboot</h2>
                    When trying to use Remote Desktop to connect to a Vista or Windows 7 PC with a 2003 domain account the user needs to be added to&nbsp;Remote Desktop Users Group which works ok until the next reboot.<br />
<br />
On the subsequent reboot the user is not allowed to login.<br />
<br />
When connecting using an Adminstrator account to check the problem the Domain user has disappeared from the Remote Desktops User Account.<br />
<br />
If the user is re added it woirks again until restarting.<br />
<br />
The user needs to be a non administrator on the remote PC.<br />
<br />
Another domain user which is a local administrator on the Remote PC and is also in the Remote Desktop Users Group does not disappear from the group on reboot.<br />
<br />
There are group policies on the domain but nothing specific to Remote Desktop.

    <title>Microsoft Store&#58; DirectX 9 required - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> limer324  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store&#58; DirectX 9 required</h2>
                    <p>When I try to install Messenger or Instagram on <strong>Windows 10 Version 1709 x86</strong>, it automatically cancels and says that my computer doesn't fulfill the requirements. I have a proper version of the system, 2 GB of RAM, and DirectX 9 or 12, but
 it still says that <strong>DirectX 9 required. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install DirectX 9, restart the computer, clean the Store cache, but nothing.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>DirectX is a set of components in Windows that allows software to work directly with your video and audio hardware. The most recent version that is included in Windows 10 would be DirectX 12. Follow the steps below to check which version is installed
 on your system:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From Start, type <em>dxdiag </em>in the Search box, and then press enter.</li><li>Tap or click on <strong>dxdiag </strong>from the results.</li><li>Check <strong>DirectX Version</strong> on the first page of the report in the
<strong>System Information</strong> section.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have DirectX 10 or later, you can install the previous version of DirectX. Some applications require older versions of DirectX in order to run properly, and you have to install it manually. To do that, you can download the installer from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. After you’ve downloaded the file, install it and restart your computer. After your computer restarts, most DirectX errors should be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know should&nbsp; you need additional assistance.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer. The dxdiag window said that the DX version was DX12. So I installed DX9, as you suggested. Restarted, it still says that DX9 required. What's wrong now? Here's an evidence:</p>

<p>We appreciate the update. Since the issue is still the same even if you have DirectX 9 or later, we suggest that you reinstall your graphic card drivers instead. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>Key + <strong>X </strong>and choose <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Display Adapters</strong> section and locate your graphic card driver.</li><li>Right click the driver and choose <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Check <strong>Remove the driver software for this device</strong> and click <strong>
OK</strong>.</li><li>After you’ve uninstalled the driver, restart your computer.</li><li>When your computer restarts, go to your graphic card manufacturer’s website and download the latest drivers for your graphic card.</li><li>Install the downloaded drivers.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            Thanks for your help, but it <strong>STILL</strong> says I need DirectX 9. I start to feel that the entirety of Windows 10 is too unfinished...<br />

            Hi Jeffrey, my name is Martin and I'm an Independent Advisor. I'll try to help you here.
<br />I suppose the Cisco VideoGuard Monitor process might be blocked by Firewall.
<br />I suggest that you follow the steps to get this issue fixed:
<br />1.    Close the Cisco VideoGuard process.
<br />- Type in  Task Manager in the Windows search bar and click on Enter.
<br />Search for the CiscoVideoGuardMonitor process, select it and click on End task/End process.
<br />2.    Temporarily disable computer’s Firewall:
<br />Are you using Windows Defender antivirus? If yes, refer to the article
<br /> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-10-turn-windows-defender-firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402854...</a>
<br />Note: If you disable the security software or firewall, the system might be temporarily exposed to security threats and risks. Please make sure to turn it on after performing the steps.
<br />Restart the computer and reinstall your favorite app.
