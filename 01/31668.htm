<h2>            Mods on Oldrim &#40;Skyrim old edition&#41; game do not work, Windows 10 Education.</h2>
                    <p>First of all hello microsoft community. I am a student, and I got this Windows 10 Education for free and it seems to be like any other Windows version only with some extra "options". Now I am guessing, okay then it should be fine running any game with no
 problem, and it does. So... the problem here is that it seems that mods on Skyrim don't work (no worries I've installed them correctly a few hundred times while I was playing on my Windows 7 before).</p>
<p>When I contacted Windows Support, they've tried everything but didn't solve it. The last thing they said to me is that Windows 10 Education is built the way it won't let "foreign" files to interfere on my game or pc. I don't understand why is this a thing
 Microsoft? My friend uses Windows 10 Professional and mods the life out of this game and he runs it with no problems at all. For those who know much about Skyrim, mods aren't harmful in any sorts. Even the Official High Resolution Textures Pack won't load.
 I tried running as an admin, installing with mod manager, mod loader, manually.... nothing!</p>
<p>As I have over 500 hours of gameplay put into this game, I was modding it maybe a 100 hours of that time. I looked up at the internet most of them said that Windows 10 Education is like any other version of Windows, only with more options, and it's free
 for students. I hope some of you Windows 10 Education users can help me, or pray that Microsoft will bring an update that will remove this blockade.&nbsp; :(</p>

======================================<br />
Windows 8 includes Windows Photo Viewer which is<br />
similar to the old Windows Picture and Fax Viewer in<br />
Windows XP.&nbsp; It is a viewer and not an editor.<br />
<br />
Windows Photo Viewer<br />
View Photos from the Windows 8 Desktop<br />

<br />
You could try using Windows Paint...or you could<br />
download and install Windows Essentials which<br />
includes Photo Gallery which has editing features.<br />
Also...the Photos App may be worth a look.<br />

=========================================<br />
Are your HPs running Windows 7? 8? 8.1? Is it possible<br />
that some update was applied to one that the other missed?<br />
<br />
Since Windows Photo Viewer does not have editing tools...<br />
which app launches when you click the editing button? <br />
Paint perhaps? That's the way Windows Picture And Fax <br />
Viewer worked on XP.<br />
<br />
Sorry I have no idea how to add the editing button...<br />

    <title>Stuck on a couple of challenge tower challenges - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stuck on a couple of challenge tower challenges</h2>
                    
<p>I've completed all of the challenge tower challenges except for two. &nbsp;The first one is where you have to beat Baraka, Sindel, and Shao Kahn on one life bar. &nbsp;This actually wouldn't be so bad, but you're forced to use Shang Tsung on this challenge. &nbsp;Shang
 Tsung's move set consists primarily of varying types of fireball attacks. &nbsp;His combos aren't bad, when you can actually connect, but the computer is pretty block happy during this challenge. &nbsp;I just can't seem to get a feel for using Shang Tsung effectively.
 &nbsp;I've tried this challenge countless times and used some coin to pass it so that I could complete the rest of the challenges and come back to it. &nbsp;Now that I've completed most of the other ones, I'm trying to pass this one, but just can't seem to figure out
 a strategy that works. &nbsp;I can get to Shao Kahn pretty much every time, but he promptly whoops my butt. &nbsp;Any suggestions from people who have passed this challenge?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other challenge that I haven't passed should come as no surprise. &nbsp;Three Shao Kahn's, one life bar, 'nough said...</p>

<p>I think there is actually a post of the Shang Tsung challenge already, I believe it's 251. So check that out for tips and for the 3 Shao Khans, I don't remember who you have to use but Khans pretty easy once you get use to him. If you can't spam a projectile
 then plan your jumps right. I usually jump in then hit him and jump back before he hits me. I'm sure others will chime in soon with some advice but yeah check the thread for Challenge 251.</p>

<p>For challenge 251 spam the fire ball and enhanced fire ball from full screen as fast as you can. (don't save for xray or breaker in this challenge. Use your enhanced fireball). You should be able to make it by Baraka and Sindel fairly easy with this method.
 Even if they try to hit you with their projectile yours will do more damage (especially using enhanced fireball as much as possible) and you should make it to Shao Kahn with almost a full health bar.
</p>
<p>When fighting Kahn you have to mix up fireballs, enhanced fireballs and a certain combo Jump+Y, Y, X, Y and repeat. The combo will be your main move against Kahn but the fireballs do help when you can get them off.
</p>
<p>For challenge 269 all you have to do is spam Strykers gun from full screen. This is actually pretty easy when you get the hang of it. The gun is so fast Kahn can almost do nothing about it. The only time you need to worry is when A) he throws a hammer jump
 straight up and then continue with the gun and B) when you kill Kahn the 2nd and 3rd Kahn will span right next to you so be ready to jump and try to get to the other side of the screen.
</p>
<p>Try Youtube for videos on these challenges. It helps a lot. </p>

<p>suprisingly the 3 shao khans was easy for me, just get full screen away, and whip out your gun, its faster then his javelin, and the only projectile he will be able to hit you with is his hammer.. but thats easily avoidable.. so spam your pistol, jump his
 hammer, and stay as far away as possible... &nbsp;dont forget to mix in your enhanced pistol..</p>

<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made to the computer/printer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is the printer connected locally to the computer or connected to a network?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Where is it saying that its offline, on your computer or on the printer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the model of the printer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Check if there is a check mark placed on the option ‚Äú</span><span>Use Printer Offline‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Start</b> and then click on
<b>Control Panel</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Choose <b>Printers</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on your printer and make sure that there is no check mark on the ‚Äú<b>Use Printer Offline‚Äù</b> option.&nbsp; This should put your printer back online.</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn‚Äôt help, then follow method 2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Run the Printer troubleshooter from the following Microsoft Article.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: </span></b><span>Uninstall the printer software that you have installed in your computer using the steps mentioned in the following website.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Uninstall or change a program</strong></span> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></a></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: make sure that the printer is disconnected from the computer.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Restart the computer once the printer driver is uninstalled completely and then plug in the printer. Windows will automatically try to install the printer drivers through windows updates. If this does not happen, then download and install the latest
 drivers from the HP Website.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 stuck at Starting Windows screen. Tried almost everything. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 stuck at Starting Windows screen. Tried almost everything. PLEASE help&#33;</h2>
                    Hello all! Thanks for taking the time to look at my question.<br />
I am running Windows 7 Ultimate on a Dell XPS 630i. I have been having some trouble starting my system.<br />
The computer appears to start normally with the dell logo and then the Windows startup animation. The animation balls rotate and come together to form the logo and then the logo just pulsates for hours. When I try to start into safe mode, the last line that
 appears is disk.sys and it stays there for hours with nothing else happening.<br />
F8 works and I can run Startup Repair with no problems found.<br />
System Recovery yields no results. I choose recent restore points that make me stuck at Starting Windows again.<br />
I believe this started after a recent Windows update.<br />
I do have a System Restore point that is a backup from a month or two ago. I was able to get this restore point to work once, but it appears to be a point that Windows had already downloaded updates and is waiting for a reset to install them.<br />
Last time I tried this restore point, it seems to have failed, possibly with an error code (sorry I cannot remember. But I can try again and post the code if need be.)<br />
I've exhausted many forums and communities and tried many different things and finally decided to post here.<br />
I'm happy to provide more detailed info if I can.<br />
Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!<br />
<br />

            Update: After trying to start in Safe Mode, I let the system sit at the please wait screen where it gets stuck at disk.sys. The system actually went to sleep and upon waking, I have a blank screen (the monitor is actually still in sleep mode, even though
 I woke the computer.)<br />
I have had problems with Windows making Nvidia updates in the past and if I remember correctly, there was a display driver update included in the Windows updates that started this problem.<br />
I have an Nvidia GeForce 9800gt video card.<br />
Thank you!<br />

            Go to the nvidia website and install the latest drivers for geforce 9800gt, might have been a problem with installing the driver with the update, or windows install the wrong one. (automatic updates occasionally do that)&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Something else that may work, open CMD and type &nbsp;sfc /scannow &nbsp;though if startup repair didn't find anything it's a slim chance.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, stopping Windows Error Reporting, Network Location Service, Network List service in services &nbsp;(type &nbsp;services.msc &nbsp;into windows search, same way you got to CMD) &nbsp;may help.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Post back if any of those suggestions help... Would be useful for googlers.&nbsp;</div>

            Thanks for the reply Angus.<br />
Unfortunately I cannot get past Safe Mode getting stuck or the Starting Windows screen to get into Windows and onto the internet.<br />
Is there a way to install Nvidia drivers without logging into Windows? I do have a laptop and various flash drives.<br />

            Tried System Restore just a little while ago and selected my backup from March 6th.<br />
System Restore did not complete successfully. An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x800700b7)<br />
I hit ok and the system restarted, stayed at the Starting Windows screen for a minute and it went to the login screen. That got me excited, BUT I stepped away from the system for a few minutes and just came back to the Starting Windows screen and it is stuck
 there again. So for some reason the system restarted when I stepped away, before I could log in.<br />

            After waiting about an hour, I shut down the system with the power button. Turned it back on after a minute or so and it told me the system shut down incorrectly, do you want to start windows normally or in safe mode? So I chose Safe Mode and it is stuck
 at disk.sys again.<br />

            Was able to run System Restore again and chose the backup from March. Still got the same error, but was able to log in and installed latest Nvidia Geforce drivers. Running sfc /scannow.<br />
Windows did download updates, so I'm afraid to shut down as they will install.<br />

            Had same problem for months and researched to no avail.&nbsp; My PC acts up right after the sound becomes "Gurgle-y" and video stutters leading me to beleive it's a video card issue.&nbsp; Only soulution I've found is to force-start it, go through repair and restore
 programs, (which fix nothing) and then cut it off for an hour or so and turn it on. It will start normally, sound is fixed and video stutter is fixed.&nbsp;

<h2>            HP SimplePass</h2>
                    HP SimplePass works wonderfully to log on to my laptop, but I want to be able to use it while on the web rather than having my passwords saved on each site. I choose to use Google Chrome and, for the first month or so when I got my laptop, SimplePass worked
 on Chrome... then it just stopped. Is there any way to make it work again? If not, can SimplePass work on the new Microsoft Edge browser? Frankly, I just don't want to have to use Explorer...

    <title>Fullscreen applications behind taskbar with high DPI settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmtoth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fullscreen applications behind taskbar with high DPI settings</h2>
                    Applications end up behind the taskbar in fullscreen mode with high DPI settings. This makes things like YouTube almost unusable. The two options I've found are, disabling display scaling for high DPI for the applications in question, or lower my screen
 resolution. I consider neither of these options a solution; disabling display scaling may be acceptable for some applications, like games, but not for a web browser since the user interface gets too small (which is the purpose of the high DPI setting to begin
 with), while lowering the screen resolution makes everything blurry, including DPI-aware applications.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is clearly a bug, and I wonder if there is an update available fixing the bug, or if at least one is planned.</div>

            <p>Disable transparency,</p>
<p>It's not operating properly, like I said it should show your desktop not the webpage.</p>
<p>But using F11 should make the taskbar collapse.</p>
<p>So this could also just be an over size ie9 window,</p>
<p>Resize the window, right corner drag it to fit between the top of your screen and the top of the taskbar.</p>
<p>You can grab the top of the window and slide it to either side until your mouse pointer hit the side wall, this will activate windows snap, and then you can enlarge the window again.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />If your only hardware change is SSD, it is quite simple.
<br />
<br />First thing, check your digital licence is linked to your Microsost account.
<br />Settings &gt; Update and security &gt; Activation.
<br />
<br />Then, to activate W10 on your SSD, you need to perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Next connect with your Microsoft account and W10 will be activated. 
<br />
<br />If Windows is not activated
<br />Select the Start  button, select Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Activation
<br />and then select Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't help, call Microsoft support to activate W10

            Hi shaibiii977 
<br />
<br />Are you just upgrading the same laptop with an SSD?
<br />
<br />If so, you do not need to worry, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi  shaibiii977
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />		Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10

<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />a
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

                    I have been using windows 10 since July, 2016, with minimal problems.&nbsp; The recent upgrade to windows 10 removed the names from the folders and files in my documents.&nbsp; Prior to this, all folder and file icons had the names visible;. now, all I have is the
 folder and file icons.&nbsp; It is now very difficult to quickly find a file or folder.&nbsp; How can I get my former view of the folder and file icons in my documents to have names displayed again?

            <blockquote>
<div>But what is the Control Panel you refer to?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I was referring to the Windows 7 Control Panel. To access the Control Panel click the
<strong>Start</strong> orb on the <strong>Taskbar</strong>&nbsp;to display the Start menu. On the right-hand side you should see Control Panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you initially open the Control Panel it may be in <strong>View by: Category</strong> (upper right-hand corner). Click the tiny down-arrow to the right of
<strong>Category</strong>&nbsp;to change the view to either <strong>Large icons</strong> or
<strong>Small icons</strong>. When you are in the icon view, you should see the applets for&nbsp;both&nbsp;<strong>Keyboard</strong> and
<strong>Mouse</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Control Panel link on the Start menu is usually displayed by default but there is a chance it will not be displayed, so you'll need to enable it. To do so right-click an empty spot on the
<strong>Taskbar</strong>, in the context menu that appears click <strong>Properties</strong>. In the
<strong>Taskbar and Start Menu Properties</strong> dialog box click the <strong>Start Menu</strong> tab, then click the
<strong>Customize</strong> button. In the <strong>Customize Start Menu</strong> dialog box near the top of the list you should see Control Panel, select
<strong>Display as a link</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> at the bottom of the dialog box, then in the
<strong>Taskbar and Start Menu Properties</strong> dialog box again click OK at the bottom. The Control Panel link should now be displayed in the Start menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way of displaying the Control Panel is by typing <strong>Control Panel</strong> into the search box on the
<strong>Start</strong> menu, the Control Panel should be display at the top of the list under
<strong>Programs</strong>, press <strong>Enter</strong> or click it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once in the Control Panel you should be able to follow the steps I outlined in my first reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you were not aware of how to access the Control Panel it sounds as though you are somewhat new to Windows 7, the links below may help you become more familar with Windows 7.</p>

<p>Best news of the year so far, when it comes to Microsoft. There's nothing better for the Xbox brand than she be considered a division of Microsoft and not occurred until then, be only a subdivision within a retrograde Division as was the Microsoft Devices
 Division. The chart of Microsoft's Divisions was until then, very harmful to the Xbox brand. Simply split the Xbox brand operations between two divisions that poorly communicated, in this case, the part of hardware and games in physical media was under the
 orders of the devices and the part of Xbox Live and games for digital distribution on Xbox was under the orders of Microsoft's Internet Division. Now the thing is to make the most sense, the Xbox more than a trademark for Microsoft, today happens to be for
 Microsoft a Division and so any business involving the Xbox brand becomes more integrated, innovative and agile. If, for example, the hardware has to be subsidized at some point, with the integration of the operations of the brand Xbox Xbox Live portion of
 copper subsidies from quietly hardware and still generates significant profits, even because this is the essence of business model consoles, i.e. subsidizing if I need the hardware for the portion of services (read Xbox Live) conquer the pockets of consumers.
 In addition the choice of Phil Spencer to lead the Xbox Division could not be more correct. The guy is really dedicated and shows everyday life have a lot of passion for what you do. It's really the Satya Nadella came to change the Microsoft for the better.</p>

<p>Now that Phill Spencer is the Xbox Division Chief, for everything to be wonderful enough that Microsoft and buy Sega, Tecmo, Capcom and Square-Enix for these coming times of development of permanent and exclusive games for Xbox One ..... hahahahahahaha</p>
<p>Now Phil needs to give visibility to the Xbox Division's internal studios developing games for Xbox One, as well as in the past, where everyone knew the times from Sega like for example, AM 2, Sonic Team, AM 3, Treasure. Today Microsoft and Xbox Division
 need to highlight in the media who are their development teams, it is necessary to give prominence to the new Yu Suzuki and Shigeru Miyamoto's own Xbox Division, and also for their video game franchises.</p>
<p>For example, the game Killer Instinct deserved a internal team at Xbox Division with big budget to take the franchise to a large landing both of quality graphics and story. Unfortunately today the only franchise from Microsoft which receives a treatment
 worthy is the Halo franchise. Franchises like Battletoads, Banjo-Kazzoie, Killer Instict, Conker, Perfect Dark, Blue Bragon, Lost Odyssey, Infinite Undiscovery, Brute Force, Rally Championship, Tao Feng, Kakuto Chojin, Blinx, Kung Fu Chaos deserve good treatment
 by the Xbox Division to which such franchises to become in blockbusters and add more and more consumers to the Xbox brand.</p>

<h3> corian5  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Windows 10 update 1804 has done something strange to my personal files</h2>
                    <p>I'm writing to ask how to fix an issue that has popped up after installing the new 1804 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the update last night and it took about three hours (I was able to watch the entirety of Skyfall and it still wasn't done). This morning I logged in to my computer under my regular account (for privacy purposes I'll just say it's called MyAccount).
 After going through the login shindig, all I saw was a black screen and my cursor. No icons, no desktop, no start menu, nothing.</p>
<p>So I scavenged around on the internet and went into safe mode, which brought all my stuff up again, and made a new account (which I will call TempUser). I switched back to normal mode and logged into this new account and everything was fine. So I go to get
 the stuff from MyAccount by going into C:/Users/MyAccount... firstly, I get the "press this button to get access to this folder" message, which does nothing at all. Opening Properties, it says MyAccount is an empty folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was terrified. All of my work stuff was in that account folder which now seemed to have been erased. Angered, I went back into Safe Mode and lo and behold, all my stuff was still in MyAccount! Now however, it seems impossible to access these files in normal
 mode. After switching again I found I was unable to access TempUser. So currently, I can only access my files from Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what's wrong? Did I not do something right? Why has this new update skewered my ability to properly sign in?</p>
<p />

            Hi Corian5, 
<br />
<br />It's hard to say what happened at the time of the updating to cause these strange login/folder access issues, however a few Windows repairs could potentially bring your system back in line. Please follow the below steps:
<br />- Boot into safe mode
<br />- Open Command Prompt as administrator (search for it within the Windows start menu &gt; right-click &gt; run as administrator) 
<br />- Enter: sfc /scannow
<br />- Once the scan finishes, enter: dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />- Once the scan finishes, reboot
<br />- Once rebooted, see if you can login as per normal
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes so I can advise further.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

<em>Windows XP Operating System</em>, the last Skype version available to install is

                    <p>I used Microsoft Photo Manager with my old Windows 7. Now I have Windows 10. But my Microsoft Photo Manager is gone. It seems as if my choice is to download Photo Gallery. But I'm confused about exactly where and how I do that. Could someone give me a step-by-step
 tutorial on how to download Photo Gallery?</p>

            Hi Dennis
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />
<br />(1) If you are using Skype app from Windows from Microsoft Store
<br />- click Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall 
<br />&gt; then install Skype again from Microsoft Store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>)
<br />
<br />(2) If you are using Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Copy the line 
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Click Windows Key+R 
<br />- Paste into Run window by CTRL+V and then click Enter 
<br />- Rename this folder to something difference for instance Skype for Desktop_Skype_Old 
<br />- Reinstall Skype (<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> )
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! If this still persists, please let me know.

    <title>Xbox One X White Controller Lag in comparison to Original Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> col tofu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One X White Controller Lag in comparison to Original Xbox One Wireless Controller</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I revived an older post and was asked to create a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So before a reader asks, here are my trouble shooting steps I have already taken.</p>
<p>1. Updated Firmware YES</p>
<p>2. Calibrated 4K T.V. for optimal gaming experience YES</p>
<p>3. Tested other controllers YES and they worked fantastic</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original post:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hi, it's not the T.V. it's the Xbox 1 x controller. I just upgraded to the one x and noticed serious delay in the controller which makes Halo 5 unplayable. Before you ask, yes I optimized my LG 4K TV and used 2 other
 controllers I had from the original Xbox one, they worked great with instant feedback. Both my original Xbox controllers left thumbsticks have now snapped a part inside due to left clicking (crouch) and moving to dodge shots (matrix style) or making crouch
 jumps throughout multiplayer locations. Anyone good at H5 with motion and crouch jumps probably have broken a left stick or two. Now all I have is this new White Wireless Xbox One X controller that makes competitive gaming impossible.Yes, even running on USB
 cable which is so two thousand and late. Besides the delay there are blatant dead zones on the right thumbstick as well. I am pretty upset by the quality control team. Had I realized the issue was the controller and not me having to break it in I would have
 exchanged it but now I am 5 days over my 30 day return to gamestop and guess I have to work with the Microsoft Store. Before anyone suggests the elite I will decline because they use the exact same left thumbstick part that is a known issue to snap with clicking
 and motion due to crouch movements in Halo.</span></p>

</p><p>OK I will give that a try when I get home and circle back here to share my results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing this is an attempt to resync/callibrate to the newer controller vs. the 2 older ones I just burned through in 1 week of intense sessions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I ran by gamestop on my way back and grabbed a used original xb1 with warranty for good measure. FYI they must have a refurb department that swaps out X &amp; Y joysticks because these aren't OEM and are trash. Frustrating times however...#firstworldproblems</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I did the 8 second hardboot with 5 minute cooldown and it appeared to help. Either it did ir I am just adapting as I went from worst to first in the last hour of grinding. Thank you to you both I hope it lasts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I also turned my Halo 5 sensitivity down from a 5 to a 4 which helped stabilize my aim a little with this model. I am thinking these newer controllers may have higher sensitivity with slight button deadspace to avoid accidental commands. Maybe
 what I was interpreting as deadspace was me just me flying past that zone in look and run. The run button still feels like it takes a second to register but again, if all other commands are registering maybe my n00b&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed- Inappropriate]</strong>&nbsp;just
 needs to adjust more.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Remote Desktop How do I know my password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrs. kravitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Remote Desktop How do I know my password &#40;credentials&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>This is between two home computers, remote desktop enabled on both.&nbsp;I am trying to connect from Computer One to Computer Two. For both computers, I disabled the login requirement at system startup&nbsp;(bypassed the login screen). There are no passwords on either
 computer.</p>
<p>On Computer One, I click "connect," and it asks for a name and password. I entered the name of Computer Two, but I don't know what to enter for password.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to enter if there are no passwords on either computer? If I have to define a password, where do I do that, on both the source and the target computer?</p>
<p>Computer One seems to have "found" Computer Two, so half the battle's won (i.e., the Remote Desktop Settings I chose are okay). My problem&nbsp;is what to enter for password.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for replying and for the suggestions.</p>
<p>I managed to get a connection yesterday from the Vista Home Premium computer to the Windows 7 computer, albeit in a convoluted way. In the&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;machine, I created a new&nbsp;user + password. Then I went back to the Vista machine and used that user + password,
 and it connected to the Windows 7 machine. I'm sure there is a more elegant method to accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>, clicking "Enter" in the absence of a password doesn't work. It just keeps prompting for a password.</p>
<p>Today I found out that while Vista Home Premium allows you to remotely connect to another computer, it does not allow another computer to connect to the Vista Home machine. So the hunt began again, and then I found<strong><em>logmein</em></strong>. I signed
 up, added all three home computers to the&nbsp;account, and presto-changeo, connected like a charm. The free version is plenty for my n00bish needs. I just wanted to be able to&nbsp;get on my mom's desktop to help and troubleshoot&nbsp;(90 years young and mastering the art
 of Google, bless her heart), and also be able to be away from home and retrieve files. And, last but definitely not least, be able to&nbsp;once in a while check up on the kitty-cats with the webcam.</p>
<p>In principle, my feeling is that in Windows, this objective should be easier to achieve. Why&nbsp;block outgoing connections from Vista&nbsp;Home, when it's available in practically every other version of Windows, whether ultimate, home, or professional?&nbsp;In practice,
 as long as I found something that does what I need, I'm a happy camper.</p>
<p>Again, thank you both, so much, for the advice.</p>

                    Why is the signature tab greyed out on my Windows live email bar? When I want to insert a signature I have to go back to my BigPond webmail and send from there.
                </div>
