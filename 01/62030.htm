            <p>This has nothing to do with Xbox. It is something you need to take up with the retailer from which you purchased the membership. And for these reasons, Microsoft always recommends you purchase your membership directly through them via the Microsoft Store on your Xbox.</p>

<h2>            Death threats not bannable&#63; &#40;sorry long read&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got my first ban from xbox live, it was a 24 hour ban for having the word "***" in my profile, even though it has many different definitions including strange, and weird, they decided I meant homosexual. I didnt have much of a leg to stand on
 to fight MY ban, yet when I called customer service after filing complaints previously about the gamertag who got me banned.
<strong>[Mod Rmoved]</strong> whom sent me 15 messages in 10 mins all of which I complained about, he said everything from threatening to *** my family and kill my kids and burn down my house, I complained twice about this person 1 for glitching/tampering and
 1 for foul language.no ban. I then proceeded to ask the tech why my complaints weren't looked into, he said I will get banned for having *** in my profile "because it alters others gaming experience" I asked him how something in my profile that you dont have
 to read to play me alters gamers experience more than people glitching and sending death threats. I have the death threat messages still recorded, played em for him, he said if they keep threatening me the mods will take away their communications???? SO IF
 YOU HAVE *** IN YOUR PROFILE, YOU GET IT BLOCKED OUT WITH CODE OF CONDUCT, THEN YOU HAVE TO NOT DO ANYTHING ONLINE FOR 24 HOURS, IF YOU MAKE DEATH THREATS AND BULLY PEOPLE ONLINE WHILE GLITCHING YOU MIGHT ONLY LOSE YOUR ABILITY TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES!?!?!?
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Mods I pose this question to you like I did the tech, where in America will I get punished WORSE for saying or writing the word *** (which has many definitions) than I would for hacking(a federal crime in certain situations) or sending death threats to
 people and *** threats. <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;have continually harassed me and when I threatened to complain they got me banned for something that's been in my profile for over a year. When will microsoft fix the holes in their complaint and banning
 system? Is it gonna take a kid killin themselves cause they're getting harassed on xboxlive before you get it right? Xbox needs to stop ignoring common sense only because its making hand over fist. I want those messages listened to by a mod and I want the
 2 that sent em to me banned. and <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>thats not an unfair request!!!!!!!! Any mods please make sense of this in a message or an email. or just send me something with the truth....xbox cant stop the glitchers, xboxlive will always be
 rampant with glitchers, and if your a normal guy that wants a fair game with no trash talk, its just a matter of time til the glitchers report you for complaing about them glitching. DISGUSTING THAT I GOT BANNED FOR CODE OF CONDUCT,YET OBVIOUS MORE EXTREME
 VIOLATIONS SUCH AS THREATENING TO *** AND KILL, AND GLITCHING GO 100% UNPUNISHED, IF THE MOD TEAM CANT DO THEIR JOB AND REMOVE THE REAL PROBLEMS INSTEAD OF BEING PLAYED LIKE AN IDIOT AND BANNING THE GUY BEING BULLIED WE NEED A HUGE OVERHAUL TO THE MODS DEPT!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Isn't that considered a terrorist threat these days? If Microsoft doesn't want to do anything about it, then maybe the police will? At any rate, I agree 100% with you. &nbsp;We live in a messed up world these days. I couldn't even put "God is good" in my profile
 (I tried Jesus, too), yet another person has a gamertag by the name of Jesuseatsfarts or something like that. &nbsp;Where's the logic in that? Anyway, I hope you get some justice with this.</p>

<p>@AZORES ASSASSIN Maybe you should read my profile. Using the word you claimed to have used gets you a 24 hr ban yes when used in the wrong context. If you read the ToU and CoC then you would have read that it is allowed to be used to describe yourself. So,
 claiming you can get banned for using said word in your profile is false. I have said word in my profile. Only because I am describing myself.</p>

<p>@KLRSKIR but the COC also says you are not allowed to abuse, stalk, harass or threaten anyone on the live network. so how can that person get away with just a communication ban when he should have been banned off Live? i think the system is stupid if the
 poster got a 24 hr ban for having a word in there he shouldnt have (not saying i dont agree that it shouldnt have been in there anyway) whereas the person harassing him gets a slap on the wrist for something that is clearly a bannable offense. that is a load
 of crap honestly.</p>

            <p>Since I have no details regarding this situation, nor the investigation (if any), I'm really not at liberty to comment. I will say that it takes far less time to institute action against a user which has visibly broken the rules (profile content, gamertag, in-game violations). <br /><br />In severe cases which involve death-threats, bodily harm, etc., it is always recommended to contact your local authorities to file a report. They will then have the means, if they feel it necessary, to contact Microsoft. Microsoft will work with the local police, and if necessary, agencies all the way up to the F.B.I. in rare cases where this is necessary. The bottom line is always follow the rules Microsoft has set forth while playing in their playground. Things don't always happen as fast as we expect they should, but things do happen. In all cases, the Policy and Enforcement Team will not disclose any information regarding any action which is taken against any user. <br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>i understand that it takes less time for those who visibly broke the rules. but the poster did say that he still had those &nbsp;messages saved and even sent them to MS. that should have been just as quick to ban the other person off live and not just a communication
 ban.</p>
<p>i dont think he has anything to worry about though. i used to get death threats all the time from people when i played on live. i used to play COD Multiplayer religiously and people i played against didnt like the way i played and kept threatening me. i
 didnt care (still dont) cuz its only a video game and i doubt that anyone would get so mad at someone in a video game that they would try to hunt down that 1 person for making them mad. but that is just me. im not saying that they should completely disregard
 the aggressor cuz the odds of carrying out the threat are extremely slim. but if they really want people to follow the COC or TOS then they should do their jobs to there fullest and ban people accordingly to the degree of the offense. because i can tell you
 right off the top of my head that by reading what the poster said, the aggressor broke 2 things in the TOS when doing that. that is what i believe should be a ban off of live. not just a communication ban.</p>
<p>and i am not arguing with you. i know you dont have any details on the situation. i am just giving my view on the subject.</p>

<h2>            Folder dividers &#40;&#34;0-9&#34;, &#34;A-F&#34; etc&#41; mess up my picture library</h2>
                    <p>My wife has done some photo sorting and after she was done, I can't remove these dividers:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e92e9811-c8fd-4221-a2de-c8dce8aaa8f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e92e9811-c8fd-4221-a2de-c8dce8aaa8f4" /></a></p>
<p>They're totally random (Why "A-F"??) and they mess up the simple looks of the folder that I've come to appreciate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the "Show", "Sort after" and "Group after" functions and would greatly appreciate any tips that lead to this getting fixed. :)</p>

            Hi Sapik,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You have mentioned that when you try to change the product key, you get the error ‚Äú<strong>'error 0xc004e016 on a computer running microsoft windows non-core edition run slui.exe 0x2a 0xc004e016 to display the error text</strong>‚Äù. We‚Äôre here to help you
 with this issue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Why are you trying to change the product key?<br />
2) Has this new product key been used in any other computer earlier?<br />
3) What method are you following to change the product key?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue could be caused due to some corrupted system files or due to some incorrect settings. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type ‚Äú<strong>slui.exe 3</strong>‚Äù and press enter<br />
b) Enter the new product key and check if it works.<br />
c) If you still get the same error, I would suggest you to again press <strong>Windows key +R<br />
</strong>d) Type ‚Äú<strong>slui.exe 4</strong>‚Äù and press enter and then follow the prompts to activate the copy by phone.<br />

<h2>            Files in Appdata&#92;roaming&#92;Microsoft&#92; deleted after update Win10 yesterday</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday's update of Windows 10 deleted my files in the Word-startup \appdata\roaming\microsoft\word\, custom colors and themes&nbsp;and templates&nbsp;in the Templates-folder and probably some other stuff. The folders in c:\Windows.old are empty. Fortunately I seem
 not to have lost anything definitely (recovering from backup, e-mail, etc.&nbsp;as I go)&nbsp;as far as I have seen but it sure is quite annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easier&nbsp;way of recovering these files? My backup is not sooooo very good. [Resolving to have a better backup procedure in the future]</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
To isolate this issue, kindly verify if it happened after an upgrade to Windows 10 or after an update from a lower version of Windows 10 build?<br />
<br />
If it happened after an upgrade, you can uncheck the hidden files and folders on the Windows.old and check for the files there. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>File explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Local Disk (C:)</strong>.</li><li>On the upper part, click <strong>View</strong> tab.</li><li>Unchecked the <strong>Hidden items</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If it happened after an update there is a possibility that the system deletes the file. We recommend you follow the steps below on how to backup your files. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> +<strong> R</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>Type <strong>%appdata%\Microsoft\Templates\</strong> and then hit enter.</li><li>Create a template folder.</li><li>In your Office program, click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Save</strong>, and then paste the address into the Default personal templates location box.</li></ol>
<p>Make sure you do this for each Office program. After you‚Äôve updated your template location, any new templates will be saved to this default location.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Deactivated</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am using Win 10 from last 2 months upgraded from Win 7. It was activated. Now all of sudden this morning it got deactivated. It shows&nbsp;Error code: 0xC004C003. It says my keys has been blocked. Why so? I cant believe this is happening after months
 of using this edition. Perhaps i should have stick with Win 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: No hardware changes whatsoever.&nbsp;<br />
But yes i logged in Hotmail account from different PC yesterday. Today in WIn 10 notification icon it asked me to verify my Hotmail account with my registered Phone no. &amp; Code. It was verified successfully. But still Windows is not activated</p>

<h2>            stretching to zoom on display</h2>
                    After insalling windows 10 I am not able to stretch to zoom on display just to enlarge the text or pictures. I contacted Lenovo Hardware manufacture as my laptop is X1 carbon. and got no answer. earlier in windows 8.1 this function worked very well. after
 windows 10 installation when touching the&nbsp;display by 2 fingeres&nbsp;I get only blue shadow upon the&nbsp;same aria. I tried the different possibilities of display setup, without any result. Please advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Thanks for your answer, I have already increased the font size from 9 to 11. it is not the issue at all. the issue is make the text larger or the picture bigger when it is needed by touching the display by two fingers. (like android) this function was
 available in windows 8. and 8.1, but it is not working in windows 10. the other display function which is failed in windows 10 too, is the&nbsp;manual scaling / zooming for display.&nbsp; the&nbsp;display&nbsp;scaling is&nbsp;applied by 25%&nbsp;interval only. In windows 8 and 8.1 it was
 possible to adjust&nbsp; by 25%&nbsp;too further more it was possible to select fri zooning by 1% interval. Maybe stretching&nbsp;to zoom function on display has some&nbsp;relation to the free display zoom.&nbsp;I am still waiting for the right help. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>Sorry for the delay in replying. If you are still facing the issue, I would suggest you to visit the manufacture website and download and install the latest drivers.
<br />
As the feature of </span>stretching to zoom on display is a hardware related, you may also contact Lenovo support.</p>

            Thanks a lot for your answer. The issue is already solved. I got automatically updating from Lenovo one week after Installing windows 10. hereafter I could see the screen works perfect and stretching and zoom on display is completely back as before. Thanks
 again for your friendly concern.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi BirdieDevon:<br />
<br />
</span><span>No, the<strong>Guest Mode</strong> is not available on the Windows¬Æ 7 build 7600.<br />
Microsoft¬Æ had included this under the Beta versions of Windows¬Æ 7 <br />
(and RC, I think) but removed it in the RTM release version. <br />
<br />
The Guest Mode worked like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=d077a52d-93e9-4b02-bd95-9d770ccdb431&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows¬Æ SteadyState</a>. However, as Microsoft¬Æ<br />
removed this they also didn‚Äôt make any new version of Windows¬Æ SteadyState<br />
for Windows¬Æ 7. <br />
<br />
Sorry BirdieDevon but Microsoft¬Æ removed this in the RTM version. <br />
<br />
<strong>@GordonBP:</strong> The Guest Mode function was something Microsoft¬Æ<br />
added to Windows¬Æ 7 User Accounts Panel when they released the <br />
Beta version (including the RC, I think this appeared in the RC as well). <br />
<br />
By enabling Guest Mode you could actually allow the user to temporary <br />
visit websites on the Internet and do other funny stuff, but once the PC <br />
restarted (or you did a regular shutdown) ‚Äì then everything was lost <br />
and the user was logged on, but all the history, files and folders the user made<br />
where wiped. (More details here: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/6520/windows-steadystate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/6520/windows-steadystate/</a>).<br />
<br />
In Windows¬Æ XP (and on Windows Vista‚Ñ¢) you can use the Windows¬Æ <br />
SteadyState for this. </span></p>
<p><span>I hope you find this information useful. If you need any further assistance,<br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.</span></p>

                    I wanted to use a Bluetooth today and found out that I don't have an option to switch it on.It doesn't appear in notification center and in parameters also.I opened device manager and looked for drivers but all drivers r installed.I followed all those
 answers about Bluetooth but all the same it doesn't appear.What kind of windows it is where such important things as Bluetooth disappear ? So how can I get back Bluetooth in my computer ? Pc name ACER ASPIRE

<p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate you getting back to us. This error occurs when Windows fails to recognize the hardware device connected to the system. To diagnose and fix this problem, we suggest that you
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>. </li><li>On the search bar, type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, and click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from the results.
</li><li>Click <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Device</strong>, click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update your device drivers</a> especially the Bluetooth driver. <span><span>While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, if you're having trouble with a device, you can try fixing it by&nbsp;updating the driver or reinstalling it.</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for the screenshot. This error occurs if a device that was previously connected to the computer is no longer connected. To resolve this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer. You may refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/310123/error-codes-in-device-manager-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. Kindly look under the <em><strong>Error codes in Device Manager&nbsp;</strong>section, and
</em>then look for<strong> Code 45 ‚ÄúCurrently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer... (Code 45)‚Äù.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome and if you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Wrongful PermaBan&#63; Opinions please.</h2>
                    <p>Just a question to the community since xbox wont ever respond to me.</p><p><br /></p><p>So, a couple months or so ago, my primary account on xbox live was permabanned. Reason: Harassment or something of the sort.</p><p><br /></p><p>Problem. I haven't been able to regularly play xbox up until last month. Before, for quite a few months, I've just been way too busy with stuff in life to jump on. Now I know it has to take a quite a bit of temp bans to get perma banned, yet I was only aware of 2 bans, both of which I attempted to appeal and was turned down. </p><p><br /></p><p>The "best" part is, is the fact that I had gotten permabanned while I wasn't even home (I was out for over a month, actually). I got home 2 days after the initial ban. Tried to sign in and seen the big red banhammer. Now see, I wouldn't have had a big problem with this, because I could just make a new account and get live and play casual like I always&nbsp;do, but that's not the case.</p><p>I've put HUNDREDS of dollars

            <p>Fact of the matter is that you failed to properly ensure the security of your account and the person(s) that gained access are the ones that did you the harm.

            <p>So you're telling me (and the whole community) that in order to be completely able to keep your account from Xbox's fury, you have to make sure your log-in information is locked up behind a vault with a handprint scanner and double key. </p><p><br /></p><p>I had my stuff LOCKED in a file cabinet.

                    <span>

<p>I upgraded a sony Vaio VGX-TP3Z-B from vista Home Premium to Windows 7. I had a Sharp LCD TV as the Monitor connected through HDMI all worked perfectly before the upgrade but after I cannot get sound through the TV HDMI, i can plug speakers into the PC &nbsp;but
 the sound is not as good as the TV s peakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the sound settings theDigital output device(HDMI) is shon as not plugged in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked for updated drivers and the ones installed seem to be the latest and Sony have no support for upgrades to Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am really stuck and frustrated, i hate being beaten, can you help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Live Mail will not display mail message body - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dickkamen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Mail will not display mail message body</h2>
                    <p>Live Mail has for no apparent reason stopped displaying the body of emails in both the reading pane and in the "opened" mail item - instead displaying an .htl icon linking to a browser version of the message and/or a .txt icon linking to a text
 file. &nbsp;These objects cannot be linked to directly but only saved and then opened from that location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempts to remedy by upgrading Windows Essential, repairing the program, restarting Windows and reconfiguring the mail accounts all failed to solve the problem. &nbsp;Prior to this problem, the inability to open attachments without first "saving" symptom
 had appeared. &nbsp;Also, Live Mail had become increasingly SLOW to load and to move between mail items by either "up/down" commands or "delete" function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reinstall, repair, and re-boot, invoking Live Mail took many minutes and the attempt to display the first mail item in the reading pane took several minutes before apparently "timing out" to the icon-only display. &nbsp;Any attempt to do anything
 else in Live Mail during this waiting time rendered the program "not responding".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!!??!!</p>
                </div>

<p>Your original instructions called for selecting the top&nbsp;<strong>2</strong> boxes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes. If the top one was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> selected, I would have expected the folder to have been emptied by the
<em>Delete</em> function. If it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">was</span> selected, then the folder would most probably not have been empty after deletion, which is why I doubted your statement that
<em>The original location was empty after the first operation.</em></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>The new TIF shows 2 files, 2 folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That looks promising. Yet you were still seeing the empty reading pane and attachments for the message body after creating a new, empty TIF folder and rebooting? That surprises me. Which build of the program are you using, on which OS and with which version
 of Internet Explorer? To see the program build, when viewing your message list press Alt-F B. I'm wondering if the program has started using a different folder for its temporary display files.</p>

            No, you can not connect the Xbox 360 to a computer. You can connect an Xbox One to a PC but only with certain games.

    <title>Video playback issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blosserdw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video playback issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Yesterday, 1/14/18, all of a sudden, videos stopped working properly on my computer. It was working fine on 1/13/18<br />
<br />
Windows 10<br />
Version 1709<br />
OS Build 16299.15<br />
<br />
When I restart the computer the first video I attempt to watch works, but after a short period of time all videos stop functioning properly. This applies to both local videos (saved to my hard drive) AND streamed videos (youtube, twitch, etc). The local videos
 will "play", technically, but will crawl frame by frame as a slow slideshow with no audio, which is pretty much unusable. Online videos will sometimes have the same behavior and other times just buffer indefinitely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were a couple of Windows Updates on 1/14/18 that I have attempted to uninstall, one for Windows (KB4056892) and another for Flash (KB4056887), thinking that was the problem, but it doesn't seem to have fixed anything. I have uninstalled and reinstalled
 the drivers for my Nvidia GTX970 to see if that was causing any problems but no luck there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I tried leaving a local video running on repeat and it looks like that kind of tricks everything into working again. For example: I leave the local video running minimized then go to youtube and everything works perfectly, but once I close that local
 video and then return to youtube, none of the videos load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what I can try out to fix this issue!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Could you try resetting your BIOS defaults?

<br />
<br />Another thing you can try is installing the latest cumulative update since you are still on build 16299.15, while the latest is 16299.192.

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Confirm you have the latest drivers for your model from the PC's Support Downloads webpage, not Windows Update.
<br />
<br />Confirm flash is installed in all browsers, using this tool, to install latest if needed:  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else works I'd run a Repair Install by installing Media Creation Tool to choose Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place.  
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>My PC was custom built back in 2011. Here are some of the components:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard - GIGABYTE GA-Z68XP-UD3P</p>
<p>RAM -&nbsp;Corsair Vengeance DDR3-1600 16GB (4X4GB)</p>

</p><p>I'm a little hesitant to reset the BIOS because I've never done that before. If I'm unfamiliar with how it might be configured (besides picking the boot drive) would you still suggest this route?</p>
<p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            Sounds an issue with the Graphics driver.
<br />Completely remove everything from Nvidia using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />You can head either to Nvidia or the manufacturer of your device to get the newest driver.
<br />Let us know if you require any assistance.

            Thanks for the suggestion! I used the utility to remove nvidia stuff and then reinstalled the display driver but it didn't seem to change anything unfortunately.

<p>I've gone through all the steps and just got done updating drivers for some things that I didn't know had updated versions. I also did a repair install of Windows 10, but nothing seems to have changed with that either. I'm fearing that I'll need to do something
 more drastic like a clean install. I was just trying to avoid having to set everything up on my computer again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the help though, it is much appreciated.</p>

            I'm sorry to hear that.  
<br />
<br />Have you compared streaming video in all browsers?  If it persists as well in video files you play then it would point to the Display driver most directly.
<br />
<br />Unless it's a hardware problem it should be remedied by a Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Did you confirm you have the latest Display driver.  Another thing to try is previous version drivers from the PC or Device's Support Downloads webpage, also by going into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu, choose Display, then Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick, to see the list of past drivers and try each of them.

            As you said Videos might buffer too, have you checked if it isn't a problem with ISP?
<br />Second thing, the updates this month have been very problematic so you can see if uninstalling KB4056892 helps.

<h2>            Wrong monitor detected by Windows Update.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit in my dual core Pentium processor. <br />
The problem is that first I thought that the native resolution of my Viewsonic VA1716w monitor is 1280*1024. But recently I found in Viewsonic website that the native resolution is 1440*900. I tried to install the drivers from the C.D from the manufacturer
 but it failed. Then I tried to install driver manually by browsing from the C.D and it succeeded. I restarted the computer but the display didn't changed. I ran Windows Update as I thought that it would solve the issue but Windows detected my monitor as ACER
 S271HL monitor and installed wrong drivers. I cannot get the option of 1440*900 resolution in Screen Resolution page. The closest option i get is 1600*900 which monitor supports but do not display correctly. What can I do to install the right drivers so that
 I can get the native resolution. <br />
<br />
<u><b>P.S</b></u> I forgot to mention that I downloaded the drivers from the website but it doesn't give drivers for Windows 7. So I downloaded the drivers of Windows Vista. But when I tried to install them it says "Your monitor is not found. Please go to
<a href="http://www.viewsonic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.viewsonic.com</a> and download the Standard_Monitor_Driver_Unsigned file" but I cannot find any Unsigned version of the drivers.<br />

            It should be noted that monitor can have an internal ID string which then tells Windows which "driver" to use.&nbsp; If the monitor does not provide a correct one or the Windows can not read it, Windows will use the generic PnP driver foe the monitor.<br />
