<h3> sonja martin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uniblue Driver Scanner</h2>
                    What is this program? Is this something that came on my computer when i purchased it like norton antivirus and then ran out? I hate sounding computer illiterate but this is the 1st computer i've ever owned and had to maintain on my own. My computer keeps
 telling me something it has found, is ancient, then asks me to download this unibue. I checked in my programs and it is listed but it won't accept the serial number i have on the certificate in my programs and asks me to purchase online. Please help. I don't
 know what I'm supposed to do.

            <p>So I feel it necessary to update everyone who may be considering paying for Uniblue Driver Scanner 2014.&nbsp; DO NOT DO IT!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I read on this microsoft community forums that my Movie Maker might not be working properly due to outdated drivers so
 having seen Uniblue Driver Scanner on my PC since the first day I purchased it I figured why not try it out.&nbsp; First off the scan and told that indeed I have many outdated drivers then click to update and the payment option of $29.95 is offered.&nbsp; I go ahead
 since it says 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee plus it is Microsoft Gold Certified.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well the results were traumatic to say the least and 26hrs later I finally got it off my PC and my files and media players are now working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let me tell you all what happens when you call for the refund; </p>
<p>1st a customer support technician proceeds to convince you that "certainly the problem does not come from our software *(even though there was only one minor problem before paying for and running their software)."&nbsp; The tech proceeds to ask for permission
 to check out my computer files and then starts to show me screens that do not appear familiar to me; for example the technician showed me that half of my microsoft processes were no longer working properly (not just windows media player and movie maker).&nbsp;
 Then the techy shows me that I have been having intrusions since the first day I bought and used the PC.&nbsp; I tell techy over and over that this is probably normal and most of us accept this fact as long as the PC continues to function adequately.&nbsp; The techy
 will still not accept that these major problems appeared after I downloaded and paid for the UNIBLUE DRIVER SCANNER.&nbsp; The end result was a couple of transfers and an offer to clean my PC and repair it for the small donation of $349!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point I told
 all of them that they are in the wrong business and instead should be working for a brokerage selling penny stocks on Wall St!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The happy ending is that I was able to remove the Uniblue software (as much as I am aware of) and then restored my PC to a previous back up point prior to the downloading of the incident and VOILA!&nbsp; My PC is now running normally and actually with less inefficiency.&nbsp;
 So my conclusion is that for whatever it is UNIBLUE is not a clean software and the people that work for them are either oblivious to what they are scamming us with or they are being conned into doing for some who are obviously getting rich off pure BS.</p>

            <p>I read that some have trouble with UniBlue, but here is my story. </p>
<p>We have a PC that has only been one major problem after upgrading to Windows10. Tried everything, but could not update the drivers I suspected I needed. Finally I installed DriverScanner and when the proposal on the new drivers were just the ones I failed
 to update, I decided to pay for the program.<br />
Soon after, the long-awaited drivers where installed and now everything works just fine!
</p>
<p>I did not however install the other two programs I was offered. I have no need for these - and they are subject to even more criticism in various forums.<br />
Beyond this program, I use Norton Security and Iolo System Mecanics.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Mac 2016 - Unable to add external contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am licensed for Microsoft Office 365 E3 and having the following issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. </p>
<p>I am unable to add external users to IM in the Mac Skype for Business 2016 client. I have been through all the steps in the Skype for Business Admin Center (allowing specific domains, allowing all external communication excluding domains, etc.) I have confirmed
 with Microsofts help desk this is all correct. However the option to add contacts in the clients contacts menu is greyed out not available. I can message and call internal organization users fine without any issues but cant add external users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.</p>
<p>When messaging internal users from my iPhone or from the Mac Client I messages to one user appear in multiple message threads. And sometimes when I delete them they reappear after a while. My phone client doesn't always sync with the mac client so I have
 to delete the threads twice.. Its annoying. Is there a way to make sure that all conversation with one users remains in a single thread?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not a super technical guy but reading and researching I have a feeling it could all relate to my DNS records however I could be way off target with that assumption also? I use AWS to host the domain which I'm not attached to and would like to move it
 to 365 if that makes everything easier and its possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Josh</p>

            <p><span>Hi Josh,<br />
<br />
1. Here are the DNS records for Skype for Business you need to add if you manage your domain which is hosted in AWS:<br />
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/333df973-6d90-401d-a2f3-4cc9dff0d56a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/333df973-6d90-401d-a2f3-4cc9dff0d56a" /></a>
<span><br />
And if you want to let Microsoft to help manage the domain, it is possible. You can refer to the articles below to know more about how Office 365 manage your domain.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-users-and-domain-to-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-users-and-domain-to-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611</a><br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-Office-365-manages-DNS-records-5980474a-097f-4f21-a864-21245314957f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-Office-365-manages-DNS-records-5980474a-097f-4f21-a864-21245314957f</a><br />
<br />
2. According to your description, my understanding is that you want to keep the conversation with one contact into one single thread including all the conversation history on different devices. Based on my experience, it is not feasible. Given the situation,
 I suggest you submit feedback regarding this requirement via the link below:<br />

            <p>Thank you for the reply Yang.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reference to No. 1 - I can confirm that I have already configured those DNS entries and tested them successfully with the DNS tool within the Office365 portal. Do you think my issue could have something to do with configuring "federation services"? If
 so how is this configured on a Mac as I have read its a Powershell thing?</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Josh,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have read the whole thread. According to your initial post, I found to try to add the external users from the Contacts menu and the option Add Contact is greyed out.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, based on my test, we need to type in the entire address of the external contact is the search field. Then right click related user in the search results and click Add Contact. Please try this way.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the “federation services”, you are right. We need a Windows machine to run some commands to check the configuration. If you cannot add external users in the way mentioned above, I’d like to confirm the following information to
 identify if the issue relates federation services:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Can any other users in your organization add external users?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue occur to external Skype for Business users or Skype users?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            <p>Hi Chris &amp; Yang,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can type in the contacts IM address into the search bar (in the contacts tab) and so far in my testing the client will only find the exact match contact only if I have listed the domain in my allowed domains and the external company have done the same
 thing in their Office 365 admin center. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However I still are unable to message them. When I send an IM to the new contact I receive a small error under the message in the message window "We couldn't send this message:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I don't know if this has something to do with it or not:- With internal contacts their IM profile name appears (i.e. if I entered my address in it would label me Josh rather than *** Email address is removed for privacy ***). So it recognizes their profile credentials however when
 trying to add an external using your method the contact continues to be labelled by the IM address if that makes sense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answering your other questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This issue is happening to all users in my organization. We all use MacBooks and work remotely from home. Which makes me think its a settings issue rather than a home router issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Yes the issue is happening with both external and standard Skype users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken with a Skype for Business developer who is looking into this for me also and hopefully have another call scheduled sometime this week. However I feel if it was a non-isolated issue then many people must be experiencing this and not able to
 communicate externally through Skype For Business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing the developer did confirm was on Skype for Business Mac you cant search the Skype Directory and they are waiting on a timeline to release that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any feedback or assistance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Josh</p>
<p />

            <span>Hi Josh,<br />
<br />
To search out and communicate with external users, both sides need to enable external communication or list each other’s domain into the allow domain lists as you said.<br />
<br />
Then you still have an issue that you sent IM to a new contact and got an error message. I’d like to confirm that whether the contact has received your IM. There is a known issue that an error ‘We couldn’t send this message’ appears when the contacts receive
 the message described in the article below. And this issue was resolved in the build 16.1.456. So you can check your Skype for Business for Mac app version and then update it to that version.<br />

<h2>            PRECISO DE AJUDA URGENTE&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Prezados, comprei meu xbox one no início do ano de 2015. Tudo funcionava perfeitamente até cerca de 2 meses, quando meu aparelho apresentou defeito e não ligava mais. Contactei o suporte pois a luz da fonte apresentava cor laranja.
 O suporte sugeriu a troca da fonte para tentar solucionar o problema. Fiz a troca. Não funcionou. Então, o suporte me sugeriu efetuar o reparo/troca do console.</p>
<p>Tive o trabalho de embalar o console e me dirigir aos correios. Enviei o console para a assistência. Efetuado o reparo/troca, recebi o outro console. Para a minha surpresa, o equipamento apresentava o mesmo defeito. Sendo assim,
 contactei mais uma vez o suporte que mais uma vez sugeriu o reparo/troca. Dessa vez, recebi um console que apresenta um ruído quase tão alto quanto o de um liquidificador (completamente anormal).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quero dizer que fui muito paciente até aqui, mas também que estou esgotado. Não vou aceitar um novo reparo/troca. Já aceitei essa opção por duas vezes e continuo com um aparelho defeituoso, e mais o fato de que o aparelho que eu
 enviei era NOVO, e os que eu recebi podem ter bastante tempo de uso. Eu espero receber um aparelho NOVO, ou meu dinheiro de volta. Quero resolver isso o mais rápido possível, e sem que haja a necessidade de acionar a justiça para cobrar meus direitos.</p>
<p>É importante ressaltar que esse é o TERCEIRO EQUIPAMENTO DEFEITUOSO que tenho em mãos.</p>
<p>Obrigado e espero uma posição da Microsoft o quanto antes, pois paguei caro pelo equipamento e já se vão 2 MESES SEM PODER UTILIZÁ-LO.</p>

<p>Eu já consegui resolver meu problema. Agradeço à Microsoft por ter se posicionado de maneira correta e respeitosa. Foi um pouco desgastante mas tudo está caminhando para a melhor solução. Quero dizer também que em nenhum momento quis desqualificar o aparelho,
 que na minha opinião é espetacular, só dei azar dessa vez. Obrigado.</p>

    <title>Move Windows 10 Library Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennethbush  say:</h3>
<h2>            Move Windows 10 Library Folders</h2>
                    <p>I would like to move my Library folders (documents, <em>etc</em>.) from my C:\ drive to another drive.&nbsp; I've found instructions in plenty of places, but, whenever I finally get to the "Move" command, I always get the following error message:&nbsp; "Can't move
 the folder because there is another folder in the same location that cannot be redirected.&nbsp; Access is denied."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what this means.&nbsp; What is the "same location"?&nbsp; Is it the location from which I want to move the folder or is it the location to which I want to move the folder?&nbsp; How do I work around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Black Ops 2 - NAT OPEN</h2>
                    
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began with a moderate NAT. I followed directions on a port forwarding website to help open my NAT. The first instructions were to create a static IP address.&nbsp; After I created a SIA, I checked my NAT and it was open.
 HMM... I thought to myself, should I proceed with the next part of the port forwarding website's instructions. That brought me to this forum where I read that there is no need to alter any other settings in my router if my NAT is open and I
<strong>CAN</strong> connect to games.&nbsp; My question is why don"t I have to open ports for a specific game and/or Xbox Live? Why did the Static IP address open my NAT without entering specific ports into my router?&nbsp; How do I know if I have the absolute best
 connection to XBOX Live and/or the game's servers themselves?</span> </p>

    <title>Lost Contacts Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smabinsmabin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Contacts Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been using Windows Live Mail (2009 version) for my emails for about 6 years. My contacts list had all my email contacts from the last 18 years.&nbsp;Two weeks&nbsp;ago my contacts completely disappeared, apart from a random 7 contacts which I don't particularly
 use. My computer&nbsp;had been&nbsp;running low on memory. There were no updates that I had run at the time. It appears I had not set regular back ups of the contacts (I wasn't aware you could, never had this problem with outlook express). How can I get them all back?
 I have searched the internet for an answer but no luck so far. Can anyone please help me??? They must still be somewhere in my computer, but where?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm really afraid that you're out of luck. That version dates from July 2009 and had a major flaw: some users found that their contacts list spontaneously disappeared. The fault was corrected by an update in September 2009, but I honestly can't remember
 whether the update caused missing contacts to reappear or not. If you want to try, follow

            <p>One last thought (you're really taxing my memory here): some versions of the program saved contacts in two places. Press Windows key + R, type
<strong>contacts</strong> and press <em>Enter</em>. Any sign of your contacts in that folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right not to trust seven-year-old software when newer versions are available. I don't think
</p>
<p>your message store would be affected by an upgrade to the 2012 version, but your default contacts list would almost certainly disappear. You should try and retrieve them and back them up before upgrading.</p>

</p><p>The technical people refer to this as inbound and outbound number portability, which is in simple terms the capability of taking a number from one carrier to another.&nbsp; While
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA256/how-do-i-get-a-skype-number?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype Numbers</a> can be "ported out" to other carriers, if said carrier can arrange the process, Skype does not support "inbound porting," so in other words we can not bring our own numbers into Skype.</p>

            If we can port a phone number into Skype it would be very beneficial like if we want to eliminate our landlines at home and go digital. Is this something Skpe would look into doing in near future? I am sure this will benefit a lot of consumers even if
 we need to pay a small fee.

</p><p>There is a solution to get a Skype Number and cancel the previous number. Unfortunately it means changing the number, but for home solution this might not be such a big issue.</p>

    <title>Want to know where icons are hidden &#40;stored&#41; in Windows 10, so - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> temporaryuser0101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want to know where icons are hidden &#40;stored&#41; in Windows 10, so I can use them as I please in documents I create&#63;</h2>
                    I have searched hi &amp; low and elsewhere inside of <strong>Windows 10</strong> to find where all the icons are stored so I can create a database or spreadsheet and copy/paste them as needed inside documents I will be creating.&nbsp; I find it is better to show
 the icons when referring to quoted documents that are intended for showing how to do something on a desktop computer plus it helps to teach inexperienced users what the icons actually mean for later reference of the inexperienced user.&nbsp; I am sure they all
 are not stored in one single location because that would be too simple and too easy.&nbsp; Thank you!

            Hi  TemporaryUser0101
<br />
<br />All Windows and application icons are not stored as images on your hard drive, they are encoded inside dll's and the program executables and are not accessible to the user . . .
<br />
<br />For example, right click an application icon  on your desktop and choose properties
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Change icon' if there is a set of icons in the program executable, you will see them there - but they are inaccessible as an image file, because they are encoded into the exe, or an application dll
<br />
<br />To get a version of those icons, google 'windows 10 icon sets' you will find plenty of really high quality versions of those icons . . .

<p>I dont know.</p>
<p>You might want to search for that info online with Bing.&nbsp; Icons generally seem to be in various windows system .dll &amp; program .exe files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might right click your desktop and select New.. Folder and leave it unnamed - then right click that folder and select Properties you will see a change icon button... and it will show the path to the icon that your new folder is using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some programs that will <a href="http://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/29/featured/icon-extractor-software-for-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
extract the .ico's</a> .&nbsp; You might want to be extra careful though.. various icon programs used to be really popular targets for the hackers to do their things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a pinch you could make your desktop white and make a shortcut to the program icon you want.. enlarge or shrink it &amp; do a screen capture.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right click on a icon and select "Properties... Customize Tab", or "Change Icon", You will get a screen to "Browse" and have a location already available...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most Icons Windows 10 uses are actually located in C:\Windows\System32...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two primary locations are...</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\shell32.dll</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\imageres.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus a few in C:\Windows\System32\imagesp1.dll and C:\Windows\System32\filemgmt.dll...</p>
<p>
</p><p>These locations are "Libraries" that are only accessible when using a "Change Icon" setting of some type... Even if you were able to "Extract" the files, I don't know if they would be usable this way...</p>
<p>I have never actually tried...</p>

<h2>            Touchpad stops working after going to login page</h2>
                    I have a Dell N4010 laptop. The touchpad doesn't work once I get past the initial window that is displayed when the computer starts up. I have checked to see if the touchpad is disabled and it is not. I have checked the drivers and it says they are up
 to date. What else should I do? Didn't have this problem with Windows 7.

            <p>Hi @tjrobil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you had a look in the BIOS settings for touchpad related settings? There might be something in there like "advanced mouse pad" or"track pad". Normally deactivating it in the BIOS does the trick.</p>

<p>Be sure to check the Xbox Live status report at the top of the page. It appears that there is a problem with Live at the moment and I suggest waiting it out until it's fixed. "Users will experience issues when attempting to purchase content and Microsoft
 Points, creating new accounts, or attempting to manage existing accounts. Additionally, Users will be unable to sign into Xbox LIVE using the Games for Windows PC desktop client only." Here's where you can find more information:

<h2>            copy &#38; paste suddenly freezing up all my browsers</h2>
                    I haven't made any changes to my settings or updated any programs recently (don't have auto updates turned on), but today I suddenly started having a problem with copying and pasting things into browsers. This happens in both the latest version of Internet
 Explorer AND in Firefox 26.0. Been using this version of firefox for a while w/o this problem.
<br />
<br />
Things I am suddenly UNABLE to do:<br />
<br />
-copy a number from an Excel field into a form in either browser<br />
-copy a URL from Notepad, OPenOffice, or Word into the URL field of either browser<br />
-copy text from one browser into another<br />
-copy any text from anywhere and put it in the search field in the browser<br />
-copy text and paste into Google's search box<br />
<br />
This is what HAPPENS:<br />
<br />
Either browser completely freezes up. I'm unable to click on another tab or even close the browser. I have to go into task manager, end the program, and restart.<br />
<br />
This has made my workflow INCREDIBLY, PAINSTAKINGLY SLOW. This is my home-office computer that I use for work only. I don't have a bunch of apps on it. I have not updated to 8.1 for fear it will be even worse.<br />
<br />
Something similar started happening with Windows Explorer a few days ago. It is constantly freezing up and I have to restart it in task manager. I've run virus checks, spyware checks, etc. This seems like a common problem w/ Win 8 looking around various forums...

            <p>Seriously? I specifically said exactly what I was doing, including "pasting INTO THE URL FIELD" of each browser. So, what I mean is, I have a text file, in Word, a .doc to be exact, that I have a list of very long URLs in. Rather than printing out and painstakingly
 re-typing all of them, I need to be able to copy (I prefer CTRL+C) into the URL field in a browser (using CTRL+V) and go to that specific URL. This is a VERY SIMPLE THING that any OS should allow you to do. I have NO problems doing this w/ my Mac, or with
 systems running Windows XP or Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only does this NOT work using CTRL+C and CTRL+V, it does NOT work when right-clicking to copy-paste, and it does NOT work using copy and paste in the programs' drop-down menus. To make sure it's not just a problem with Word, I tried copy-pasting from
 Notepad and OpenOffice as well. Same problem. No problem copy-pasting between those programs, but I can't paste into any browser text fields, including the URL field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm NOT using a tablet. This is my work computer. I'm not swiping&nbsp;through a Netflix queue&nbsp;or playing Angry Birds. I'm doing something that should be painfully simple and easy, and IS simple and easy in any other OS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I reboot, the problem goes away temporarily, but I can't be constantly rebooting my computer all day. This shouldn't be a problem, and it looks like thousands of WIndows 8 users are complaining about it in various forums. Sorry if I'm a bit frustrated,
 but it seems to me like Windows updates should focus more on usability and less on making things look cool, because who wants to use something that looks cool but is a nightmare to actually work with?</p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop - Soft Keyboard &#47; Zoom</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 8 Remote Desktop client is very good, but missing some key functionality to make it more functional on my Surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; It needs an easy and smooth pinch zoom feature (like iTap RDP has for IOS and Android Devices), and quick gesture based commands
 to bring up a soft keyboard on the tablet, switch connections, etc...&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gestures, not charms or hidden commands are what this app needs to be able to be used fluidly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there plans to enhance this app to include this?</p>

            <p>I too have been spoiled with the BRILLIANT gestures of 'Itap rdp' in IOS. </p>
<p>I am doing pretty good at migrating over to using a new Windows 8 tablet. (From years of iPad use)</p>
<p>But my one major complaint is the reduced functions in the native Windows rep client. Losing the ability to zoom on the remote desktop is aggravating. Zooming accommodates using a higher screen resolution on the remote desktop than the local tablet. And
 gets rid of having scroll bars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fact is, iTap for Windows would be a life saver!&nbsp;</p>

            I've upgraded my PC to Windows 1803, unfortunately Windows is still crashing when I use Visual Studio to debug. I've raised the issue on Feedback Hub as well. The last good windows is 1703 without March and April cumulative updates. I think this information
 is critical for people experiencing the reboot issue.

<p>Apparently you have to run Visual Studio as Administrator to avoid PC crash</p>

    <title>High CPU usage by system processes in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walter zrep  say:</h3>
<h2>            High CPU usage by system processes in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a new HP Probook 450 G5 with Windows 10 pro. Occasionally (often after I start the PC from sleep mode) the "System" process starts consuming about 25% CPU and stays like this until I reboot the notebook. I have already re-installed Windows 10, but
 nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using "Process Explorer" I can see that the time is spent in a thread ACPI.sys+0x21cb0. I have contacted HP's support about the problem. They have checked various settings and finally told me that the CPU usage is normal. However, this doesn't&nbsp; seem to make
 sense, because the notebook is sometimes running for a long period with the "System" process consuming less of 1%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions what I should think about the statement from HP support and how I should proceed? Any help is highly appreciated.</p>

            Fast way to normalize CPU usage instead of rebooting is press on 'Scan for hardware changes' in the Device Manager.&nbsp;But I also want to know real way for solving this problem forever.

    <title>&#91;Solved&#93; Driver not fully removed after uninstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaha_  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; Driver not fully removed after uninstall</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was updating my intel ethernet drivers.</p>
<p>I had 23.5.1 installed and wanted to install 23.5.2.</p>
<p>The removal of 23.5.1 was already completed and I already started the installer for 23.5.2 when I suddenly had a Bluescreen.</p>
<p>After starting the PC up again 23.5.1 is still listed as installed in "Apps and Features" but for the i211-AT adapter it already shows the default Windows driver as being used in the device manager.</p>
<p>When trying to remove it through Windows "Apps and Features" or when running the 23.5.2 installer PROWinx64 I get following message because it wants to remove 23.5.1 first:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's German and basically says the feature is on resource that is not available and wants me to select the folder that contains the PROSETDX.msi.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fforums.intel.com%2fsfc%2fservlet.shepherd%2fversion%2frenditionDownload%3frendition%3dTHUMB720BY480%26amp%3bversionId%3d0680P000005sSrt%26amp%3boperationContext%3dCHATTER%26amp%3bcontentId%3d05T0P00000HD28a%26amp%3bpage%3d0" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PROSETDX.msi file is in the same folder:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fforums.intel.com%2fsfc%2fservlet.shepherd%2fversion%2frenditionDownload%3frendition%3dTHUMB720BY480%26amp%3bversionId%3d0680P000005sSry%26amp%3boperationContext%3dCHATTER%26amp%3bcontentId%3d05T0P00000HD28f%26amp%3bpage%3d0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>and when manually selecting it I get following message:</p>
<p>Basically saying the select file is not a valid installation package for 23.5.1 and to search the file in another folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fforums.intel.com%2fsfc%2fservlet.shepherd%2fversion%2frenditionDownload%3frendition%3dTHUMB720BY480%26amp%3bversionId%3d0680P000005sSs3%26amp%3boperationContext%3dCHATTER%26amp%3bcontentId%3d05T0P00000HD28k%26amp%3bpage%3d0" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So obviously this got all f'ed up because of the Bluescreen.</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix this without a new installation of Windows?</p>
<p>I don't have a system restore point to use.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>

            The only things I can suggest is to use the Intel driver updater to see if that’ll remove the old driver first before installing the newer one:
<br /><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support...</a>
<br />You can try Revo uninstaller free: <a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstalle...</a> to see if the old driver is listed &amp; remove it, if it still gives an error don’t worry as the scan for leftovers will then remove the driver, consider this similar to a forced uninstall.
<br />You can try a repair upgrade if you think Windows is the problem:
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then you can try an in place upgrade repair:

<br />This will also upgrade you to the latest version of Windows - currently 1809.

<p>Your installation problems can be solved easily without upgrading to windows or reinstallation of windows .</p>
<p>Because&nbsp; the file PROSETUPx.msi is&nbsp; missing , thats why you could not able to uninstall old version&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same problem happened tome. what I did the following methods</p>
<p>method&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled same old driver version to windows and then I updated to latest version</p>
<p>
</p><p>method 2</p>
<p>I had downloaded the same version, and then i extracted the .exe file through 7.zip.exe&nbsp;software, then i found the PROSETUPx.msi file, and copied to the required path .and then i uninstalled the old version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i installed the new version. That's all problems solved&nbsp;</p>

<p>The file is there for me as you can see in picture 2.</p>
<p><br />
<span>But I found a solution!</span><br />
<span>I started the installer and the uninstaller at the same time.</span><br />
<span>While the installer is running it creates another TEMP folder identical with the broken one but with a (1) behind it in the name.</span><br />
<span>In the uninstaller I then chose the PROSETDX.msi file in the folder with the (1) behind it and was able to fully uninstall the rest of 23.5.1 drivers.</span><br />
<span>Then I clicked on install in the 23.5.2 installer and it was able to successfully update.</span></p>
