    <title>Microsoft Maps - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Maps</h2>
                    <p>Now I've got Maps integrated with a GPS can I ask if the fairly obvious updates are on the horizon? Things like being able to identify 'roads' that no longer exist (Donkey tracks, 'roads' that are staircases. 'roads' that are just wide enough for a bicycle.
 'roads' where there is an instant fine if you drive a car down them, 'roads' which have not existed for 5 years or more)&nbsp;and so on). Use 'Here' maps - get lost in Tarragona!</p>
<p>My favourite is a TomTom device that tried to take me across an open field on my way to Bristol Airport, but the 'Here' mapping system that has, for the last 5 years (and about £1,000 worth of map upgrades in that time), demanded I take my car down 147 steps,
 is a close second.</p>
<p>In short, when can I knock non or closed roads off my system and make individual changes?</p>
<p>Joking aside, the bridge in Cockermouth has been closed because it became unstable in the floods. That's OK but the system WILL NOT permit any other route, and WILL NOT offer any alternative. Not good.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Scott,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you facing this issue only while opening Group Policy Object Editor or other administrative tools as well?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The issue may occur if the security settings for the Local Machine zone are configured to prevent ActiveX content from running.<br />
<br />
You may follow these steps &amp; check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to
 modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry
 if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, click Run, type ‘regedit.exe’, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Expand the following registry subkey:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\0</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the right pane, right-click 1200, and then click Modify.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Value data box, type 0. Then, click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Quit Registry Editor.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this issue still occurs after you perform this procedure, your administrator may have set a policy that prevents ActiveX content from running in
 the Local Machine zone. We recommend that you contact your administrator to configure the settings for the Local Machine zone if you are under any active domain.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.<br />

    <title>Does my Intel Core i7-720QM support Win 10 64-bit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blanka_s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does my Intel Core i7-720QM support Win 10 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Does my Intel Core i7-720QM support Win10 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
64-bit</span>?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Win7 64-bit. The Win10 system requirements specify </p>
<p><strong>"To install a 64-bit OS on a 64-bit PC, your processor needs to support CMPXCHG16b, PrefetchW and LAHF/SAHF."
</strong></p>
<p>but I'm having trouble finding this info about my CPU. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please don't refer me to the Get Windows 10 app as it does NOT specify whether or not your processor will support the 64-bit Win 10</strong>, only that it supports Win 10 ... I get "This PC works with Windows 10"... ok, thank you, but which version
 would be nice to know! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been struggling trying to get this question answered for my processor. The app says my system requirements are fine for Win10 but
<strong>will I end up with a Win10 32-bit once it is installed? </strong>Or actually get the 64-bit that I need since I use a 4TB hard drive and the 32 bit is incompatible with that. I know there is a month within which I can revert back to my Win7 64-bit but
 I won't be able to get back the programs and software that I sacrificed to try and switch to Win10. The ones that the Win10 installation uninstalls or makes me uninstall (I already know there are some because the Get Windows 10 app told me so) so I don't feel
 comfortable with using that month as a safety net within which to try out Win10. Loosing those programs will be bitter enough for me let alone if I ended up with a 32-bit version of Win10 on top of that.
<strong>Unless I know <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">FOR SURE</span> my Win10 install
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">WILL</span> be 64-bit I do not want it on my device.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I used <strong>HWiNFO64</strong> and found my&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Intel Core i7-720QM
</span></strong>DOES have the <strong>CMPXCHG16b</strong> but the <strong>"PrefetchW"</strong> is confusing me since I don't know what it is or by what other names it may go by. Below is all I found and I did not find anything with "<strong>LAHF/SAHF</strong>"
 at all and also don't know what other name it may be hiding under.</p>

            <p>Well i have upgraded 30 systems so far to windows 10 64 bit and am here because a Samsung Laptop with an i7 720QM will not INSTALL at all, i even tried a clean install and they all choked when after it loaded it tried to boot into windows 10 mode to complete
 the install. This system ran Windows 7 Pro 64bit before trying to install by upgrade and fresh install.

            <p>Thank you for your reply. The reason I posted my question here though is because the 2 links you posted above did NOT answer my question to begin with so I'm sorry but they are not helpful in my case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you mind expanding on your general statement "If you have 64-bit Windows 7/8.1, then it will upgrade to 64-bit Windows 10." please?
</p>
<p>What knowledge makes you so sure since (as I mentioned above) the requirements specify
</p>
<p><strong>"To install a 64-bit OS on a 64-bit PC, your processor needs to support CMPXCHG16b, PrefetchW and LAHF/SAHF."</strong>? (<em>As of my initial post I have found out that my CPU does support LAHF/SAHF but still no luck on finding out if it supports
 PrefetchW.</em>) There ARE some CPUs that do NOT meet this criteria and therefor can NOT install a 64-bit Win10.
</p>
<p>Did you look up my specific CPU somewhere to check that it is compatible with a 64-bit Win10?</p>
Thank you in advance.

</p><p>Were all 30 systems an i7 720QM and just the Samsung laptop was a problem or were they all different CPUs and the problem arose when you had to deal with this particular CPU (i7 720QM)?</p>

            This isn't absolute, but at the bottom-right corner of the login screen, use the power/restart option and then try logging in again.&nbsp; A restart is a more complete reboot than a "shut down and turn it on again", which uses hibernate technology to speed
 it up), but a true restart will sometimes clear transient issues.

<p>Thanks, Shawn, for the effort.</p>
<p>I tried the Restart suggestion but it had the same effect as Shutdown.</p>
<p>I think the last time this happened, I just re-installed Windows.&nbsp; There's no real data on that computer so it was not too bad.&nbsp; But it just takes so long I'd rather not do that now.</p>
<p>So I still need some help.</p>

<p>Alright, give this a shot.&nbsp; I've seen at least a few folks say this made it work.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hold down shift while you click the power/restart icon on the lock screen (keep holding shift before and after you click the power/restart option), and keep holding it until the next screen appears.</li><li>Choose Troubleshoot, then Advanced, then Startup options</li><li>Choose Safe mode</li><li>Login to Windows in safe mode.</li><li>After the desktop is done loading, choose Start/Power/Restart to go back to normal mode and try logging in.</li></ol>

<p>I went thru all those steps.&nbsp; When I logged in in Safe Mode, it did the same thing - desktop flash for a second then back to Safe Mode Logon screen.</p>
<p>I did a Restart (regular), with the same result.</p>
<p>After the first logon attempt in regular mode, a Welcome screen shows with:</p>
<p>Upper left corner - "Welcome to Windows 10"</p>
<p>Upper right - "Like what yo see?"</p>
<p>Center - "Discover what Windows 10 can do for you"</p>
<p>clicking on this screen brings of the logon screen.&nbsp; After entering password, desktop and some window appears for a second, the back to the Welcome screen.</p>

<br />
<div>You have to be in an Admin Command Prompt window to issue that type of command - note also that sometimes a System Error 5 can also be the result of file corruption, It may be simpler to slave the HD and pull the user's data off, then do a System Recovery
 or a clean reinstall.</div>

            First, try signing out of the Microsoft Store. Click your Profile picture at the top right, click your account then sign out.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer, launch the Microsoft Store app, sign in again, then attempt downloading again. 
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Still not working? Try creating another user account then try downloading from there:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-manage-user-account-privileges-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-manage-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

            <p>Don't bother with the above if there are no compatible drivers.</p>
<p>Simply download and install Vista x64&nbsp;drivers in compatibility mode. You may (or may not) get some funtionality from installing them.</p>
<p>Failing that, you will need to buy a cheap USB audio device that <strong><u>IS</u></strong> W7 compatible (SoundBlaster ... etc)</p>

<h2>            Skype&#58; How to make one Account Alias to be the primary one and if safe to remove the old Primary Alias</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a skype account which has an alias,</p>
<p>Now we would like to unlink that email address from this Skype Account,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have got </p>
<p>1 issue,</p>
<p>. Before we can remove it, looks like we have to add a new Alias in and make the new one to be the Primary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we have added 2 more new email addresses in as the aliases (one added in 1 day before, one added in today)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one from outlook.com one from outlook.com.au but somehow we cannot make them primary</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; when we try, we got error says</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We were unable to make **************************** your primary alias. Please try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>and 1 question,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The current alias is actually an existing email box and has been being used for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; if we can manage to remove it, will the physical email box be gone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5f9a8399-ddda-42dd-b434-8842b54f3146" title="XinxinXie">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the email you are trying to make your primary alias already linked with another Microsoft account?</p>
<p>If so, please be reminded that it is not possible to add it. You can only use a primary alias that is not associated to any Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference: <span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12407/microsoft-account-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Manage aliases on your Microsoft account</span></a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>That could be&nbsp;the reason why you keep on getting errors every time you try to change the primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is not possible to unlink Skype and&nbsp;Microsoft accounts since they are considered as one account.</p>

<p><span>Dear Mark,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the reply.</span></p>
<p><span>Please find my answer to your question below,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Q: Is the email you are trying to make your primary alias already linked with another Microsoft account?</span></p>
<p><span>A: No, they are the new ones we put in via skype portal.</span></p>
<p><span>(we also tried with an existing Microsoft account and it was not allowed)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If “</span>it is not possible to unlink Skype and&nbsp;Microsoft accounts since they are considered as one account.<span>”,</span></p>
<p><span>That is fine,
</span></p>
<p><span>Could you please advise?</span></p>
<p><span>How we can make the new added in aliases to be the primary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would not be possible to add your outlook email since it is already a Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information from the link I provided you regarding "managing your alias", it is noted that:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ul>
<li>You cannot add an alias that is already associated with another Microsoft account. Aliases cannot be used to share information between two Microsoft accounts—the ability to link Microsoft accounts was discontinued in 2013.&nbsp;</li><li>Existing <strong>@hotmail.com</strong>, <strong>@live.com</strong>, <strong>@outlook.com</strong>, and
<strong>@msn.com </strong>addresses can't be added as aliases.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have to set an email address&nbsp;which isn't included on the list so you can set it as your primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>as mentioned before,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did add 2 new email addresses which were not included on the list but we still could not make them primary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for Microsoft to force to change it from the back end?</p>

<p>
</p><p>We have no&nbsp; option to change emails on the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are these new emails that you mentioned created via Microsoft?</p>
<p>If so, you won't be able to ad them because that is already a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to add an email which is not from Microsoft and is not linked to any Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any emails with the suffix <strong>@hotmail.com</strong>, <strong>@live.com</strong>,

 64 bc the old version is installed, but can't uninstall the old version without the new version.&nbsp; Help!

            <p>This does not help, unfortunately.&nbsp; You'll note that step #1 in the instructions is to "uninstall itunes".&nbsp; If I could do that, I wouldn't be posting!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is not that I don't understand how to uninstall itunes, or that I'm missing the uninstall of some peripheral program.&nbsp; the problem is, very literally, that ITUNES WILL NOT UNINSTALL!&nbsp; (I'm not meaning to be "yelling" or getting pissy, but I am
 trying to be clear.&nbsp; I got two answers back with the same response, so I'm wanting to clarify that I'm not asking "how do I uninstall itunes", but "I need help because itunes will not uninstall")</p>
<p>As mentioned in my initial question, there seems to be some sort of version incompatibility or some other strange issue.&nbsp; I am hoping there is some back door way to force an uninstall.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jeff<br />
I see that you have gone through the walk throughs from Apple support.<br />
Quick question, has that always been the case with your Windows 7? <br />
In other words, is there a restore point we can back up to where Itunes is not installed?<br />

            <p>Eddie, unfortunately there isn't.&nbsp; itunes was transferred over to this laptop when I got it new, and itunes was on my old machine. It hasn't worked from the first time I tried it on this computer w Windows 7, but I haven't really spent much time trying to
 fix it until now.&nbsp; So, short answer is that itunes has never worked for me with Windows 7 on this machine,
<br />
so there is no pre-7 point to roll back the clock (unless somehow it helps <br />
to go back to the other laptop).&nbsp; A0 I still have it, but don't know if it still works. &nbsp;It was running super hot which motivated me to get get a new laptop, and I haven't tried to turn on the old laptop for months now.</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp; Jeff</p>

 way, I did the Blackberry uninstall at the same time that I failed to uninstall itunes, just a few weeks ago.</p>

                    Every time something is installed on one user desktop it also installs on all users desktop. How can we install things that we only want on our individual desktop without it installing on every ones desktop.

<br />
It’s not perfect, but you could remove the shortcuts from the Desktop, which should give the impression that the program doesn’t exist.

    <title>Brightness Setting With No Keyboard Keys Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> link3505  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brightness Setting With No Keyboard Keys Windows 10</h2>
                    The setup I'm using right now is a MacBook Pro, using BootCamp to run Windows 10, as well as OS X. My problem is I turned down the brightness on my laptop, to the point it actually shut the screen off. The keys on my keyboard aren't working, because I
 haven't installed the latest version of BootCamp to support the MacBook's keys for screen brightness, so I have no way to reset the brightness from Windows. I can, however, get into all the files from the OS X side of my laptop, so I'm wondering what file
 I can edit or delete, if it's even accessible, to reset the brightness in Windows. Any help on this would be awesome, please!

<p>I've had this error code for about a week now in which whenever i go to use an app or play a game it signs me out of my profile. So after i sign back in i am able to use my apps/games but once i am finished using a game or app and i exit the session, this
 error code 8b050008-00000000-00000000 pops up and then automatically signs me out of my profile and disconnects me from Xbox live. My account information is up to date and i downloaded the Xbox update that came out today so everything is updated. I checked
 the error code database and this code is not found. There is one other person on the forums that&nbsp; has almost the exact same problem as me and his gamertag is Cellwarfare.</p>

    <title>Recover lost files from Win 10 reset failure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recover lost files from Win 10 reset failure</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I am posting this in desperation hoping there is some possible solution to my problem.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I just did a Windows 10 reset on my wife's 3 month old Dell laptop, choosing the option to keep all data. The reset sat for over 2 hours at the 94% mark, so I figured it had hung and did a hard reset. After the reset, all of our pictures (thousands) are gone.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
When Win 10 started back up, and I realized all of our pictures were gone, I started searching for them. I found about 600 in the recycle bin (we did NOT put them in there) and immediately restored them. However, these accounted for less than 10% of our pictures.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I popped the hard drive out and put it in my desktop PC and proceeded to run every data recovery tool I could find on the drive. DMDE was the only tool that netted any significant results, about 800 recovered pictures.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Strangely, most recovery tools can see nearly all of my pictures (around 11k) including the file name, creation date, file size.. however, when I try to recover them, the files will not open and just cause an error for any photo viewing software I try, leading
 me to believe the files have been corrupted.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I’m trying to figure out what, if anything, I can do from here. I’ve exhausted all recovery options within Windows (no restore points, no backups) that I know of to no avail. I’ve tried jpeg repair tools, but they were of no use.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
The only things I can think to do from here are to send the drive off to a professional data recovery service, but my guess is they can’t do much more than run cots recovery tools. Or, I am thinking of trying to run the Win 10 reset again, and hope that it
 may pick up where it left off and somehow restore the files.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Any guidance or insight would be immensely appreciated.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
EDIT- One more detail is that all of the corrupt files are sitting in a directory c:\Windows\Logs\PBR\Rollback\NetLogs&lt;user&gt;\pictures\</p>
