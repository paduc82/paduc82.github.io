<h2>            Product key already used on another device. Error code&#58; 0xC004C008</h2>
                    <p>I think I messed up when setting up my new computer.</p>
<p>I bought a product key and entered it into the setup. The message I got afterwards said "The upgrade option isn't available if you start your computer using Windows installation media".&nbsp; So instead I installed windows the advanced way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later when I try to activate my product key in the settings menu, it gives me&nbsp;Error code: 0xC004C008.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought the key and know that I have not used it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway I can get this resolved as I paid full price for a Windows 10 Professional Oem Key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Enoc</p>

 on your end? A screenshot of the issue will help us determine what could be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response. <br />

    <title>Taskbar scales down icons, using larger sizes and making them blurry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brett doyle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar scales down icons, using larger sizes and making them blurry</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to make customized icons for the taskbar, but have come across an annoying problem.</p>
<p>Icons on the taskbar do not display correctly, using the wrong size image, and resizing them (icons on the desktop look fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a icon with images of sizes 16, 24, 32, 48, etc. All images are a repeating grid, the three smallest shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46055cfa-87c8-494a-8e59-301fc17277d3" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/446f1378-74b7-4bba-9bed-1682b8fe7830" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6be4f00-85a7-4807-9b77-68c851c2a7dc" />&nbsp;(16x16,
 24x24, and 32x32)</p>
<p>When in the taskbar, it displays like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0e9f019-2795-483c-ac65-062dbfecbc7e" /></p>
<p>It uses the 32x32 size image, but displays it as 24x24, making it blurry due to scaling down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If "Use small taskbar buttons" is checked, it shows up like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d0cfc72-2e49-4f9e-9972-caeb9600a000" /></p>
<p>This uses the correct size, and displays it correctly, but is not that useful since the icons are tiny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reason why the 24x24 images are not used, or is this a bug which I need to wait to be fixed?</p>

            This ugliness and many other small things has me forced to return to Win8.1 which is pretier and much more polished.&nbsp;But i am afraid this will be not fixed, not because MS has incompetent artwork team, but because&nbsp;simply they not give a damn. If they would
 care, taskbar would be normal size like in 8.1 with properly scaled, sharp icons. Talking about icons, replacing remaining Vista Aero icons with new ones would propably bankrupt them :) Anyway not like i care anymore, mandatory driver updates in Win10 are
 showstopper for me..

            These are small things but if they doesn't work - they ruin everything. These blurry icons are just one of many UI defects I have noticed. I would never thought one day MS will deliver such bad looking UI. If updates can't fix such simple things it means
 MS doesn't have <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">competent people. Really how can you be so blind guys!? This is eye-hurting stuff.&nbsp;</span>I go back to Windows 8.1.

<p>Hi EdwinTanguma:<br />
<br />
The TechSupport Forum thread <em><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/f217/solved-stop-c0000218-registry-file-failure-dell-with-vista-657278.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Stop:c0000218 {Registry File Failure} DELL with VISTA</a></em> dates
 back to 2012 but might have some helpful information.&nbsp; In that case a Dell Inspiron 1525 user was able to find the
<strong>corrupted registry entry</strong> (in his case, pointing to C:\USERS\GARRY\LOCALS~1\TEMP\045f7b1.com'\) left behind after malware was removed from his system and he was able to delete the registry entry causing the BSOD. There are many other issues
 that can result in this c0000218 error (e.g., a registry cleaner that removed a required key, files written into a bad disk sector, failing RAM, etc.) so diagnosing the root cause could be difficult.&nbsp; If you believe a malware attack triggered these BSODs and
 all else fails I'm wondering if booting into Safe Mode and restoring your system to an earlier date might help.<br />
<br />
If you ever solve your error c0000218 BSODs you can run the <strong>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</strong> (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20</a>)
 to see if your system hardware and peripherals meet the minimum system requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic hardware requirements are also posted at
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/10737/windows-7-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/10737/windows-7-system-requirements</a>, but you cannot upgrade from Vista SP2 to Win 7 SP1 for free so you would have to purchase a new Win 7 DVD or product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a quick check on <a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.newegg.com/</a> and prices currently range around $100 - $200 US for a Win 7 Professional license, so you would have consider if it would even be worth spending that type of money for an OS that reaches the end of extended support on
<strong>14-Jan-2020</strong> and then install it on a machine with a relatively slow CPU, limited RAM and older hardware components (e.g., network and graphics cards, etc).<br />

            Thanks. After reading the linked instructions I can do everything up to step 7.&nbsp; When I start the "import" a new window opens and my photos slowly appear in the boxes for selection to "import".&nbsp; The window allows me to select my photos but after doing
 so there is no "import" button to press to start downloading into the computer.&nbsp; The window is not moveable so it isn't hidden.&nbsp;right clinking anywhere in the window does nothing. &nbsp;It seems like before when I went to import it would open up on the original
 photo app home window and after hitting "import" it would ask me if I wanted to erase the card after importing.&nbsp;That entire option all of the sudden disappeared on my app. &nbsp;Very weird to me.&nbsp; If tried both the card reader and the camera link so that isn't
 the problem and I was able to import no problem on my windows 8 laptop.<br />

<h2>            Battery problems after windows 10 upgrade&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues with my battery and this started since I upgraded to windows 10. It was just fine the day before that when it was windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the battery status using the command prompt and here is the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Battery:Last Full Charge (%)</div>
<div>
<div>The battery stored less than 50% of the Designed Capacity the last time the battery was fully charged.</div>

<p>
</p><p>When it shows that it's 30% on the taskbar, it suddenly jumps to 7% and I have to recharge it.</p>
<p>I bought this laptop in December/2013, so I guess it's still early for the battery to become very weak or dead, as the new laptops now last for a longer time.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem, and my laptop was bought September 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My battery doesn't last as long as it used to and the "battery meter" is crazy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 19% of battery it tells me "2 min until fully charged".</p>
<p>I just wanted to know if this problem will be solved quickly or not so I can do the downgrade back to Win7, where my battery was normal..</p>

<p>I got the same problem with Windows 10 on Toshiba Satellite P55T B5262, just few months old.</p>
<p>This problem was not happened with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The command powercfg /energy returns "Last Full Charge" numbers that decrease so quickly that I think they are incorrect.</p>

<p>It seems that the battery is not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Aditionally, I found a link that reports the same problem:</p>
<p>http://www.tomsguide.com/answers/id-2288092/toshiba-laptop-drains-battery-life-quickly-stops-draining.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Toshiba Laptop (Toshiba Satellite P55t-B5262, bought from Microsoft Store) will drain battery quickly on very light use (word processing, browsing pictures, etc.) down to 9% in about an hour. Then, it will stick at 9% and tell me it has only a few minutes
 left, but actually last for another 1.5 hours more.</p>

</p><p>I recently also calibrated the battery (discharged it to 5% and put it in sleep mode for a few hours, then charged it back up to full,...) and still this problem is occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just restored the Laptop back from Windows 10 to Windows 8.1, and run powercfg /batteryreport. The above issue seems disappeared:</p>

<p>I am having the same problem, and my laptop was bought September 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My battery doesn't last as long as it used to and the "battery meter" is crazy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 19% of battery it tells me "2 min until fully charged".</p>
<p>I just wanted to know if this problem will be solved quickly or not so I can do the downgrade back to Win7, where my battery was normal..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also having the same issue, with only 10% charge it says only 04 minutes&nbsp;are remaining to fully charge the battery.</p>
<p>If you were able to fix this then please let me know the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Well, after reading all these posts, it appears that the problem is not fixed. &nbsp;I have an Asus and it goes to 53% and then stops charging. &nbsp;I have tried everything in the posts (twice now), and it did not fix it. &nbsp;Is Microsoft going to have a patch for
 this or a fix? &nbsp;If not, then it sounds like I'll be installing CentOS. &nbsp;Please advise.

<h2>            Installing a new copy of windows.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Lenovo B50-80 laptop with i7 u5500 16 gb RAM Radeon r5 m330 Graphics card with windows 7 pro pre installed [upgradeable to windows 10].</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was slow since the beginning, [not hardware issue] I want to re install the operating system using my key in the bios. i tried to download windows using that key but was denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All i want is a fresh installation of the OS. Because of this problem i am now using portable linux from my pendrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Karthhic.</p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://neosmart.net/wiki/lenovo-recovery-disk/#Recover_Windows_7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://neosmart.net/wiki/lenovo-recovery-disk/#Recover_Windows_7</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other options to consider - more involved:</p>
<p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

    <title>Task Manager RAM Usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knute97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Manager RAM Usage</h2>
                    <p>My computer is running 64 bit Windows 10 with 6 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been monitoring my memory usage via Task Manager and occasionally download tasklist via the cmd line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has been bothering me is that my RAM usage at reboot starts at 34%, and left alone, increases to ~75-80% without running any programs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(I do have start up programs including McAfee, Dropbox, Seagate console, gadgets, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I analyze the tasklist download file via Excel, the total RAM memory usage is approximately 3.1 GB at 79%.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Doing the math, this means there is only 4 GB in use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 questions:</p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>1. Does Task Manager list all the RAM usage or is there some background usage that is not shown.?</p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span>2.&nbsp; Is there any other way to monitor RAM leakage?</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question about McAfee antivirus running against Windows Defender and RAM leakage, please refer to the information provided below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Your Windows Defender should be turned off if you have an anti virus working in your computer system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* You may check for updates for your Windows 10 system in order to troubleshoot the RAM leakage issue, you can also use the following helpful tool for additional help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC or System File Checker and DISM. </p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">System file check (SFC) Scan and Repair System Files &amp; DISM

            Hi TGRLOVR
<br />
<br />Generally if that is a wired mouse, you just plug that into a USB port and it should work, if not try another USB port
<br />
<br />If that is a wireless mouse, make sure you have put batteries into the mouse, turned it on if there is a switch on the base and plug the mini-USB receiver into your Dell
<br />
<br />If that does not work, please let me know . ..

<h2>            Issue installing Exchange 2010 SP3 Rollup 21 on SBS 2011</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue installing the Update Rollup 21 for Exchange 2010 SP3 on an SBS 2011 server.&nbsp; I have successfully installed this same rollup on a another standalone Exchange server with no issues.&nbsp; This SBS Server is currently running Exchange 2010
 SP3 with Rollup 17:<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/508e985d-3872-426c-b106-8771c34d2f66?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/508e985d-3872-426c-b106-8771c34d2f66?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UAC is turned off</strong>, I have tried running the update by double clicking it and invoking the msiexec update from an elevated command prompt and both fail.&nbsp; When I try to install it from command line, two of my existing rollup files get deleted
 and I have to replace them (RU8-v2 &amp; RU13).&nbsp; Here is the command I used:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed2eec98-996a-4c5f-9c4c-33714ddc18cc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed2eec98-996a-4c5f-9c4c-33714ddc18cc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I double click to install, it still fails but the files don't get deleted.&nbsp; Here is the error message I get either way:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e870444-867a-47dd-8c4a-a540a2951b3a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e870444-867a-47dd-8c4a-a540a2951b3a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research on this error and came across an article that explained to run a verbose log output command to capture what it is failing on.&nbsp; Here is the command I ran:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">"C:\Shares\Applications\Exchange 2010 SP3\Exchange 2010 SP3 Update Rollup 21 (KB4091243).msp" /lxv* "C:\Shares\Applications\Exchange 2010 SP3\SP3UR21.log"</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">

    <title>Have to keep resetting local ethernet adapters, internet connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> u2jedi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have to keep resetting local ethernet adapters, internet connection fails</h2>
                    Keep having to reset local adapter, message usually reads connection between network and modem/access point/router is broken. So I troubleshoot and it resets the local adapters (I have 2 ethernet ports on my ASUS Crosshair motherboard). It works good for
 awhile then the connection fails. I know it's not the board because my Fatal1ty An9 32X had the same issue in Windows 7 64bit. The chipset on both boards is the nVidia nForce 590 SLI

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try the below step to fix .</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open the Task manager.&nbsp; Here’s a tip:&nbsp; Press CTRL+Shift+ESC.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click File &gt; Run New Task
</span></li><li>
<span>Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges”
</span></li><li>
<span>Type Powershell
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Type the following in the Powershell prompt:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Wait for PowerShell to execute and complete the command. Ignore the few errors (in red color) that may pop up.</span></li><li>
<span>When it finishes, try hitting Start and hopefully it’ll start working.</span></li></ol>
<p>Please reply with the results, I will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did open PowerShell with administrative rights, and ran the command. Unfortunately it is still not working. I did get red messages but mostly for the apps that are not working, the other apps that do work like calculator didn't show up errors. This is
 the log I got:</p>

            Connect to the Internet. &nbsp;Once the apps get a connection and phone home, they seem to kick over and work. &nbsp;The Powershell trick I have not tried, but is supposed to do the same thing. &nbsp;But seems like it does not, according to many others who have tried
 it.

 but it will show back up when you restart but does the same thing when you try to open it. After reading all the online chsts about this is Microsoft going to send out a fix for this or is there one available from them now? I am not getting any fault codes

    <title>Windows 10 displays blank windows until resizing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 displays blank windows until resizing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 Home 64 bit on my PC and have a non-consistent issue where I click to open System or Calculator or some other item and I am presented with a blank window.&nbsp; To get the render to complete, I have to resize the window a bit and then it renders
 normally.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not sure why or what triggers this. I can generally reboot and then it will render fine for a unspecific time period but is not a constant issue.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am running an Nvidia GTX 1080 video card with the latest drivers and display is on an LG
 34UM95 running at 3440x1440 60 hz via display port.&nbsp; Any ideas why the rendering of windows would be blank occasionally?</p>

            Hi gfouts15,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />The issue you are explaining could be due to both driver error or filesystem corruption. I would suggest you to follow this procedure:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + X
<br />2. Click on "Device Manager"
<br />3. Click on "Video card"
<br />4. Right click on your Nvidia GTX 1080 
<br />5. Click on "Uninstall device"
<br />6. Click on "Detects Hardware change" (monitor icon)
<br />
<br />Also, you can follow this steps:
<br />
<br />1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar 
<br />2. Right click on "Command Prompt" 
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator" 
<br />4. Type "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />
<br />Then : 
<br />
<br />1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar 
<br />2. Right click on "Command Prompt" 
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator" 
<br />4. Type "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />5. Type "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />6. Type "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />
<br />You can also perform a clean boot:

<br />
<br />Please let me know if that fix your issue.

            Hi gfouts15
<br />
<br />As you already suspected, this is caused by your Video card device driver, when you resize the window, you are causing a screen refresh which then renders the windows correctly . . .
<br />
<br />The newest, most up to date drivers are sometimes not the best drivers . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

            Hi Swagdallen
<br />
<br />Is that definitely a ttf file, fonts generally download in a zip file - what options are you getting when you right click that file?
<br />
<br />If that is definitely a ttf file, you should be just able to drop that into C:\Windows\Fonts form inside Windows File Explorer

<h2>            100&#37; disk usage on start up of windows 8.1</h2>
                    Ive been using my computer for around a month now and noticed that its become very slow on startup since i installed windows 8.1. I've checked my task manger and the disk usage was around 99-100% during startup however it settles down after around 5 minutes,
 clearly this isn't normal. not sure what to do. Also coincidentally, this high disk usage started after i'd restarted and downloaded windows 8.1 and I also re plugged my graphics card adapter back in after i realized that is wasn't plugged in properly :/ (ive
 been using my PC for around a month without it in) not sure if the graphics card has anything to do with it. anyone got any solutions? :) &nbsp;

    <title>W10 built-in Apps like Store, Photos, Calculator, etc are greyed out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> break80  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 built-in Apps like Store, Photos, Calculator, etc are greyed out and do not run.</h2>
                    <p>I have been getting educated and working on this problem for 3 days now and getting frustrated.&nbsp; Now I can't simply uninstall/reinstall W10 all over again because I have over a year's worth of 3rd party programs, settings, and applications set up and working
 (unless I can do that without loosing them which I have not been able to determine).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In those days I came to the conclusion that I should be restoring system files to get my STORE and other apps back.&nbsp; I already tried rebooting and Powershell can't find files either. &nbsp; So first question is: Do I need to replace corrupt system files in your
 experience?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across a the Wiki article by ZigZag3143 which showed how to use SPF and DISM to restore the files (I tried to comment back on the Wiki discussion but it appears to be closed.). &nbsp; "sfc /scannow" is giving me the now popular and fateful it seems message
 "unable to fix some files".&nbsp; DISM scanhealth told me it is repairable.&nbsp; but DISM restorehealth says "the source files could not be found". &nbsp; When that happens I am supposed to use an ISO as the source.&nbsp; So I created an ISO on a thumb drive using the directions
 given (about a 2 hr process) and reran the DISM.&nbsp; Same result.&nbsp; Hmmm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run an index on the install.wim file but that failed.&nbsp; A little more digging and I learned I have an install.esd file instead.&nbsp; The index on that worked so I know that my iso "seems" to match the system version.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I learned the install.esd file is a compressed file.&nbsp;&nbsp; So my next question is can I simply replace all "wim" with "esd" in the DISP commands and expect this to work?&nbsp; Or do I have to somehow convert the esd to a wim file (which sounds kind of shakey
 to me) before going on to try again?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; Many of the things you mentioned I have previously tried.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It was only then that I turned to the SPF and DISM programs to fix the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Are they the wrong approach?</p>
<p>I am extremely concerned about losing my already installed applications programs, so do not want to do anything that could destroy them from working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I do not know when the problem started since I don’t usually use Store and Photo.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All I know is when I tried to use Photo several days ago, it was grayed out of Start Menu.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Currently it is NO longer even in the Start Menu!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>No computer changes I can think of.<span>&nbsp; </span>There have been numerous updates to my software, I presume many pushed to my computer by the vendors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I already created another account, but it had the same problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I abandoned that approach.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unless some reason to try again, makes no sense to do again.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Careful review of Windows 10 updating history showed the updating service tried many times to update “…C++ 2012 4 …”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Even though it said the update was successful, apparently it was not truly successful since it kept trying to update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I found a posting that suggested finding this program in “Programs and Features” and running the update from there (Change).<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I did that is seems to have been fixed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now my Windows 10 is up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>My history shows the last Cumulative update was 3/9/2016 and successful.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However the last two saves were from the end of March (3/25 and 3/30).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I guess not enough space allocated to have saved the others.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>SPF and DISM programs the wrong ones to use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system version is Version 10.0.10240.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>However the official ISO version I created is 10586, not 10240.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Where can I get the correct version? </p>
<p>My computer in an Surface Pro 3 I7 loaded that <span>&nbsp;</span>I bought in Feb 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Finally, I am more than willing to answer any questions you have, or give you control on my computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please ask me questions so I can help you help me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thanks.

            <p>Thanks very much.&nbsp; I installed from the ISO as you suggested and it went very smoothly.&nbsp; Took less than an hour to complete, plus an additional 15 minutes for W10 to get and install the latest updates to W10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards I checked out a few of my programs and Microsoft Apps like Photo; seem they are back and running ok.&nbsp; Thank you very much for your suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in the future if I have a similar problem, would it make sense to go through the same exercise and try reinstalling the latest ISO from Microsoft?&nbsp; Or should I follow the direction in "System file check (SFC) Scan and Repair System Files &amp; DISM to fix

            There are only Windows 7 drivers and earlier listed for this model
<br />
<br />You can try downloading the Windows 7 driver, then install in compatibility mode:
<br /><a href="http://support.lexmark.com/index?productCode=LEXMARK_X2600&amp;page=product&amp;locale=EN&amp;userlocale=EN_US#2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lexmark.com/index?productCode=LE...</a>
<br />
<br />Install in compatibility mode:

<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Connect the printer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Add printer
<br />
<br />Click 'The printer what I want isn't listed'
<br />
<br />Select 'Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings'
<br />Select 'Use an existing port'
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Under Manufacturer, scroll down then select the printer brand
<br />Over the right hand side, scroll down through the list and look for your printer model.
<br />
<br />If you don't see it, click Windows Update and wait while Windows Update checks for the printer.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't find it, click the back button, then click Next again.
<br />
<br />This time, select printer brand and in the printer list, select a driver series that closely matches your printer model

            Hi Dewana.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.       
        </p>

            Hello, 
<br />Try reinstalling the Printer.
<br />Right-click Start and select Run.
<br />In the Run dialog box, type in control printers and press OK.
<br />Locate your printer in the Printers section, Right click it and select Remove device.
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />If you have a setup media of the Printer driver(This is usually a CD or Setup program supplied with the Printer), run the utility and let the Printer Install.
<br />If you do not have a setup media, try adding a printer manually using "add a printer" button in the menu bar. It should automatically detect and Install the Printer.
<br />After the Printer Installs, try printing a test page to see if it works as desired.
<br />Retry the task again.
