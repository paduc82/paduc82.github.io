<h2>            you dont have permission to save in this location. Contact administrator to obtain permission</h2>
                    I have 2 brand new PC's each running windows 8. &nbsp;Both PC's. &nbsp;I have set up a homegroup and both PC's are in the same homegroup. &nbsp;I can see and open files on both PC's through the homegroup but I cannot make changes to any documents (i.e. MS Word, Excel)
 and re-save them as I get the error "you don't have permission to save in this location. Contact administrator to obtain permission". &nbsp;Each PC has only 1 user account set up, it is a local administrator account with full permissions. &nbsp;I have checked the security
 settings in the homegroup and it is set up to be able to share documents. &nbsp;I have also opened the properties tab of the folders I want to save the documents to and checked (enabled) the sharing settings. &nbsp;Still doesn't work. &nbsp;I am very frustrated as this should
 work much more easily (that's the whole point of the new "homegroup" feature isn't it ? &nbsp;Please advise.

            I have set up the files I want to access for "viewing and editing" on the homegroup... done it several times actually. &nbsp;Each time the host PC shows a process with a green bar where it is setting up the files for sharing, but afterwards I still can't save
 files... I can view them but not edit them. &nbsp;My guess is the host PC is not retaining the updated sharing settings. &nbsp;Please advise.&nbsp;

    <title>Keyboard keep changing to US layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hero-x1c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard keep changing to US layout</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with Japanese layout keyboard.&nbsp; I am using it outside of Japan with English as the main language.&nbsp; I have removed all US layout keyboard and kept only my Japanese layout keyboard in the settings.&nbsp; My problem is that Windows keep using the
 US layout keyboard ALL THE TIME and never lets me use my Japanese layout.&nbsp; An even bigger problem is that 90% of the time I don't know where all the symbols are on the keyboard since the Japanese layout are physically different from US layout.&nbsp; For example
 if I type in SHIFT+2 in US keyboard, I will get '@'.&nbsp; But in the Japanese layout I will get the " sign instead.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; dedicated button for @ without using the SHIFT button for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I did manage to somehow get it to change to Japanese layout, it would revert back to US layout after switching off and reboot.&nbsp; I have tried resetting and re-installing Windows too many times to remember and it happens like that all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening and how do get the default to always stick to Japanese layout and never switch to US or other layout for that matter.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is up to date, as of now today.&nbsp; For the second and third part of your recommendations, I don`t know Japanese and I am not typing in Japanese.&nbsp; I just happen to have a Japanese keyboard on my laptop.&nbsp; Another thing, I couldn't find the Japanese IME settings
 in Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select <strong><em>Japanese - Microsoft IME</em></strong> under <strong>Override for default input method</strong>. is not there</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i did find the <strong>Override for default input method </strong>in the Advanced Keyboard Settings and changed it to the Japanese Keyboard I have.&nbsp; This is what I have done.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I only installed one (1) keyboard but I have 3 keyboard options here.&nbsp; How did that happen? When I selected the Japanese Keyboard, the layout would correspond to the Japanese keyboard layout and turn out OK.&nbsp; But this has happened before when the layout
 would magically change back to US keyboard and ruin my day again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this info helps with a solution.</p>

<p>This is a problem that for me started after the May 2018 1803 update to Windows 10 Pro. I am also aware of another PC running Win 10 Home with exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>Despite going through all the settings, my normal keyboard layout (English UK) gets shifted back to English US. This has been a real pain as it seems to do it on a whim. One of the bad consequences is if you use characters like @ in e-mail addresses or banking
 passwords, you can get really messed up - banks often only allow three shots at entering PWs before locking you out. It can take three shots to realise the damned keyboard has changed.</p>
<p>In all the versions of Windows I've used and all the Win 10 builds up to now, have I ever had to mess with keyboard settings.</p>
<p>In "advanced keyboard" settings, English(USA) is the only choice, promoting langauge preferrences does nothing and why does it tell me that my organisation has hidden some settings?</p>
<p>Total shambolic madness. Fix this one pronto Microsoft, or test your updates for something as fundamental as this before inflicting yet another problem on your customers.</p>

<p>Still on-going.</p>
<p>A real pain as it affects passwords, e-mails and some of the coding I do.</p>
<p>Changes keyboard about every 30minutes and I cannot pin it down to any activity in particular. The last cumulative update for 1803 seems to have done nothing to fix this.</p>
<p>When you ask about the trouble-shootings steps I have tried, which ones did you have in mind?</p>
<p>This is a well-known problem since update 1803 and affects many users. Hard to believe that in well over 40-years of working with computers that this is where users end up. MS forces these updates on me and the problems they cause - MS needs to fix it. Please
 don't suggest PowerShell fixes because they don't work and I'm not prepared to mess up a critical PC for this.</p>
<p>The PC worked fine through Win 7 Pro and all the updates up to 1803 - 1803 is the culprit.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In respone to the same problem, I have yet to resolve it and it stil gives me problems.&nbsp; The problem is not in using the Japanese ro Korean or other language IME to type.&nbsp; Its just using the different keyboard layout other than US layout.&nbsp; I understand that
 the UK keyboard layout is similar to Japanese where the @ 'alias' key is situated next to the letter P and not using 'SHIFT 2' in the US layout.&nbsp; Plus all the symbols are in different locations. I cannot memorize the locations of all the symbols.&nbsp; I only remember
 location of the @ 'alias' key.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I had to do a hard shut-down (hard power-off) the other day as the PC had become unresponsive (thank you Edge).</p>
<p>After a long and shaky restart, my English (United Kingdom) keyboard is back and hasn't reverted to United States layout in over 48-hours. Normally, it would have changed within 30-minutes. Won't call this a miracle cure and haven't altered any settings.
 Just waiting to see what happens when the update to 1803 arrives. Nice to be able to type normally again, but not counting chickens yet.</p>

<h2>            Help needed for windows 7 on presario f700 series laptop</h2>
                    i have a compaq presario f765em ( part of the f700 series ) , my question is why dose windows 7 pro lose my DVD rite drive it just disapears, i have tryed the upper and lower fillter fix, with no luck, i can not click on drive icon as there is not one
 found in device manager, or anywhere else for that matter, yet with vista it was there and even xp found it, when i installed the win 7 pro upgrade the dvd drive was shown for apx 5 minits then disappered, i have no external devices attached, i went in to
 safe mode and the drive was reinstalled and worked fine , i then rebooted back to normall mode and the drive was found but disappeared again after a few minits, and just to let you know i have replaced the drive with an exact new replacement so i know the
 drive is fine, this is driving me nuts :(, please can someone help??, just to add the only other problem with this model is the builtin webcam comes and gose as well but i,m not to bothered about this as i do not use it.

<p>Hi <strong>Sgt-bilko1st,</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to download the latest DVD/CD drive firmware/driver and update from CD/DVD drive manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>If it does not disappear in safe mode and works fine there then there might be some third party software conflict happening as it disappears in normal mode after sometime. I would suggest you to perform clean boot on the computer.</p>
<p>Clean Boot Troubleshooting.</p>
<p>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password, Or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party program is causing the problem, referring the link given below:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Reset the computer to start as usual.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</p>

            thanks for the advice, i have tryed all that you have surgested but still the drive is not there, stange thing is a few days ago windows automaticly started downloading drivers for all missing hardware including dvd drive and webcam, and once finished
 everything worked ____ for apx 30 minits :(, and then they all disapeared again, so somewhere on the system is the required microsoft drivers but windows 7 dose not see them, also; &nbsp;had the same idea of doing a firmware update but of corse it can not update
 a drive that is not seen by windows :(. , and just to add the safe mode option no longer works either, this is driving me nuts, i know all the hardware is working fine but just trying to convince windows 7 to see it is the problem, i remember in the day "
 xp " had simular problems and a little tweaking of the sys32 drivers file sorted this, i wonder if there is a tweak out there that could do the same for windows 7?., as for 3rd party drivers , i clean installed windows 7 using the usb fla

<h2>            Exchange a Windows 7 key for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>How can I exchange a W7 key for W10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a W8.1 desktop where a repair service replaced my licensed 8 copy with 8.1 after the disk failed. Meantime the machine keeps crashing and now will not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am installing W10. I need to know if there is a mechanism to enter my W7 (cant find the W8 version) key and get a W10 version in return.</p>

            <p>The computer was running windows 8.1 as installed by a repair shop. I'm not sure of its origins. It had boot issues so I have made the W10 upgrade and now I need to provide it with&nbsp;a Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a store purchased Windows 7 Home Premium that I bought when it was released. It is currently not installed anywhere but I retained it complete with license. My Microsoft records should also show that I purchased both Windows 8 and 8.1 in 2014. The
 machine they were installed on is now scrapped so this license should also be available to be swapped out for an upgrade.</p>

            <p>Hi Santosh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your link through to a second level. It appears that there is a delay of a few days in some valid installs picking up their licenses from the server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that the version on the pc was valid this may resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also an option that I would be reluctant to follow - reinstall W7 and follow the upgrade path!</p>
<p>

 and closing it and starting it up again but it's always the same. Is there any way to fix this?</p>

            <p>I'll give an answer. What the questioner does not understand is that MS Paint does not have a setting for the DPI. There is no default DPI setting in MS Paint. The setting is controlled by the scanner driver or the scanner itself. MS Paint simply communicates
 with the driver for the scanner, which then takes over to do the scan, then upon completion, it hands the scanned data back to MS Paint. Therefore, the settings the questioner claims to know how to change are not in MS Paint; they are in the scanner driver
 interface. That driver determines how it handles the settings after returning the scanned data to the calling/connecting program, in this case MS Paint. Most all scanner drivers revert right back to their default setting. In this user's case, it is 100 dpi,
 but for a different scanner, it could be 150 dpi (common with many scanners a few years back), and more recent scanners often default to 200 dpi. After each scan, you have to change from the default settings all over again, because once the scanner driver
 has turned the scan data back over to the calling program, it no longer is communicating with it. It doesn't matter whether you use MS Paint, Picasa, IrfanView, or any other program that connects to the TWAIN scanner. If you start out with a scanner that has
 a default setting of 300 dpi, you wouldn't have thought it was an issue to ask about. You can't be insistent that no one is answering your question if it is based on the wrong premise to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some scanners allow control from the scanner itself. I use an HP combination (All-In-One) printer/scanner. I can set the default up on the printer/scanner control panel to be 300 dpi or whatever value I want; I often set it to 600 dpi. Then I can scan directly
 from the scanner/printer and always get 300dpi/600dpi scans. Depending on the default program to handle the saved file type determines which program will be executed when the image is sent to the computer. It could be MS Paint, or IrfanView, or any other.
 Very often, I send the scans to an SD card on the printer instead. When I am finished, I have an SD card with the images scanned at 300 dpi that I take to a different computer. Since the scanner/printer has been set to use 300 dpi as its default, MS Paint,
 IrfanView or any other program that initiates a scan will also get 300 dpi scans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the questioner needs is a scanner that allows its default to be set or one that defaults to 300 dpi to begin with. If you try a newer scanner, you may find that the settings is not returning to 100 dpi but instead to whatever setting the scanner has
 as its default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since most simple scanner drivers always revert back to the devices default setting, and in this case, that scanner setting is only 100 dpi, you can use software that is specifically designed to solve this program by having its own settings for resolution.
 One example is called "Scan it to." In its interface, you choose what resolution you want, then when it communicates with the scanner, it takes care of changing the setting each time a scan is requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether you use color or grayscale is a separate choice apart from the dpi setting. Some scanners can scan at a different resolution for grayscale than they do for color. Regardless, the problem and solution is the same.</p>

<br />
You can sync your Google contacts using People app on your Windows 10 PC, however with Google account's two-step verification turned on, you have the option to turn off the verification or contact Google support for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post again if you have other concerns.<br />

<p>Thanks for responding so quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This answer isn't particularly helpful given that even Microsoft has two-step verification and that Windows 10 doesn't have problems syncing calendars and emails with the built-in apps. I have successfully set up Outlook 2016 using an app password with a
 Google account (which has two-step verification) but I would really like the People app to work (as it does perfectly well on my Windows 10 phone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions would be welcome.</p>

            The problems still exists. I have run the Troubleshooter for Windows Apps. It reported
<em>Windows Store cache may be damaged</em> and then fixed it but no other faults were found (on re-running the trouble shooter, the same error comes up and is fixed again which doesn't sound very convincing).

<p><span>Hi all,</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I purchased an Xbox One console a couple of weeks ago. Friends suggested I register the console on my Xbox account, so it can be tracked if stolen etc. I have gone through the web form to register
 my console, adding the required details, including the serial number of my console.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I click submit, it displays an error, which I have included below. I've tried using Chrome, Firefox, and IE, on multiple different PC's, and at different locations. Anyone else having the same
 issue?</span><span><br />

<h2>            Dance Central Spotlight</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, i've bought the Xbox One from resaler (network operator p4). There were included 3 games. One of them is full downloadable game Dance Central Spotlight with 10 songs - at least the concent on the sheet says that. The problem is: after i scaned the
 QR code with the game it has started to download but after that, it appears to be only a trial version. There are only 2 games and nothing more. On home screen there are home screen popping up and says i can try trial version od logout. Is this a code mistake
 or what?</p>

<p>Hey again everyone!</p>
<p>Hopping back in here to thank you guys for all your continued patience as we worked through this. We really do appreciate the updates and additional information you guys are posting up, as it helps our teams better understand what you all have been experiencing.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, I would suggest trying out these troubleshooting steps below first to see if we can get the full game to download for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete Dance Central Spotlight. </li><li>Power cycle your console by holding the power button for 10 seconds. </li><li>Try redownloading the game.
<ul>
<li>When you go to redownload the game, make sure you are signed in with the correct account that redeemed the code originally.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>If you're still having an issue after trying these steps above and you haven't already, please be sure to send me a&nbsp;<strong>private message</strong>&nbsp;when you have a chance. Also, include the code you originally redeemed that is having the issue. To&nbsp;<strong>private
 message</strong>&nbsp;me, click on the envelope icon labeled "private message" under my post.</p>
<p>Sending me the code and any other information you may have in a&nbsp;<strong>PM&nbsp;</strong>helps out the investigation in a big way. Thanks so much!</p>

    <title>Skype for Business 2016&#58; When a call connects, microphone volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrick d fletcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business 2016&#58; When a call connects, microphone volume goes from 100 to 40 &#40;inaudible&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Using Skype for Business 2016, HP EliteBook laptop running Windows 10, Logitech G230 gaming headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect a call in Skype for Business 2016 (including when using the "Check Call Quality" feature in Audio Device Options), my microphone volume (Manage Audio Devices-&gt;Recording-&gt;my microphone-&gt;Properties-&gt;Levels) gets set to 40, which is completely
 inaudible. I need to manually change the microphone volume after connecting a call for anyone to hear me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I disable this "feature"? Does Skype for Business 2016 still allow me to disable automatic gain control using Shared.xml? If so, what is the setting for that file?</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify where the issue lies, could you please adjust the input level via the steps below?</p>
<p>1. Right click Speaker icon on the lower right corner and select <strong>Recording devices</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df77b301-8328-4d46-826c-d2f7c9a43b8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df77b301-8328-4d46-826c-d2f7c9a43b8f" /></a></p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>Recording</strong> tab, select the <strong>Microphone</strong> you are using and click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31236404-6520-4fb6-9e51-25b0b3f64aa4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31236404-6520-4fb6-9e51-25b0b3f64aa4" /></a></p>
<p><span>3. Click on the <strong>Levels</strong> tab.&nbsp; Check if the Microphone level affects the Skype for Business microphone volume.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56e95d6a-2a9a-4a44-b61d-ce99a64e3d88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56e95d6a-2a9a-4a44-b61d-ce99a64e3d88" /></a></p>

<h2>            my external I&#47;O Magic Light Scribe dvd drive is seen as an external hard drive&#63; WTF&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;Just bought an I/O magic dvd super multi w/ Light Scribe, Xpsp3 sees it as "removable disk" when I try to access it , I get" please insert disk. Tried every known media dvd/rw+/- cd rom the whole sha-bang a bang with the same results. upon looking in
 management this device comes up under "disk drives" as "SPIF301 USB2Sata Bridge Device". The problem is I/O magic and Light Scribe don't have drivers as this is supposed to be a PnP device, nor does Microsoft(as far as I can tell). And every tech boob I talk
 to, makes me jump through retard hoops like Its operator error. I.E. change drive letter ,reboot,&nbsp; go into management and start and stop services, make sure the cables are connected , power is on , put on a chicken suit and do a rain dance, yada yada yada.
 A straight answer from somebody would be helpful, because as of right now I have a very pretty $89 paper weight that I might heave through the window of the retail store where I bought it.Then poop in boxes and mail them to level 1 tech guys all around the
 world...I have the time and frustration. Jk, but seriously someone has to know whats up out there.<br />

    <title>Manage files and folders separately - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> margotbean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manage files and folders separately</h2>
                    
<p>In Win 7 Explorer, under "View, Folder Options", the option to manage (html) files and folders as separate files is gone.&nbsp; I've tried the registry tweak (<em>i.e.,</em> add DWORD
<strong>NoFileFolderConnection</strong> to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer) but it does not work for me!&nbsp; I tried values of 0, 1, and 2...in addition to adding the key to "\Advanced" and "\Advanced\Folder" under the Explorer
 key.</p>
<p>I also heard that this option showed up in XP only after MS Office was installed...so I busted out an old copy of MS Works 2002 and installed Word....it didn't work.&nbsp; I'm not about to spend another penny buying ANOTHER copy of Office just to fix this issue.</p>
<p>I'm finding the "manage as one file" option&nbsp;to be&nbsp;INTOLERABLE.&nbsp; Please help before I give up in disgust and install Linux.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; If you don't know the answer to that, you should NOT be doing Microsoft support.&nbsp; I will say that I misspoke when I said "View, Folder Options."&nbsp; It's actually "Tools, Folder Options", then the "View" tab (or "Organize, Folder and Search Options.")&nbsp;
 Hope that clues you in.&nbsp; If not, see the first sentence.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I don't know, as I implied in my question.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; None.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've actually solved the problem myself.&nbsp; I exported the "THICKETS" registry key from my XP machine to my Win 7 machine.&nbsp; Now, not only are html files managed separately from their folders, but I see the radio group to change that behavior in the "Tools,
 Folder Options", "View" tab.&nbsp; Something about selecting the option I wanted from the visible radio group and then clicking "OK", then restarting, forced Win 7 to do what I wanted, whereas simply adding the "NoFileFolderConnection" registry value did not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I want to know what other desirable behavior is hiding in this bloated operating system but is inaccessible to me, hidden underneath a massive pile of maddening behavior...</p>

    <title>360 Slim with 4 gb HD &#43; Ultimate Edition &#61; problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> volimar  say:</h3>
<h2>            360 Slim with 4 gb HD &#43; Ultimate Edition &#61; problem</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a new 360 slim with the 4gb hard drive.&nbsp; The problem is that the Ultimate Edition doesn't read my hard drive as a hard drive when I try to install the 2nd disc (DLC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know a solution?</p>

<p>That's because the 4GB isn't actually a physical harddrive. It's 4GB of flash memory. You'd need the 250GB harddrive in order to install the second disc.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro &#43; RAID &#40;nvraid&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my Wíndows 7 PC to Windows 8&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;b9200. I have a mother board from ASUS: A8N-SLI Deluxe&nbsp; and I am using it RAID abilities.</p>
<p>I have 4x1TB disks used as RAID 10. The installation itself went totally fine and Windows 8 saw the array perfectly without any additional floppy or driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It has been quite a fight under Windows 7 to get it working properly but after using the latest drivers and changing a bad cable, things were going good.</p>
<p>Since I upgraded to Windows 8, I randomly get BSOD. That occurs sometimes right after booting (no time to do anything) or after an hour. I have checked the even viewer and I can see the bad guy: nvraid.</p>

&nbsp; &lt;/EventData&gt;<br />
&lt;/Event&gt;</p>
<p>I have tried upgrading the drivers but Windows tells me I have the latest ones. I was thinking about installing back the old ones I used for Windows 7 but it sounds like calling for troubles.... I find no help online about this issue.</p>
<p>The last time it happened, I was no even doing anything, the machine was just idling (well probably doing its own stuff...) when it rebooted.</p>
<p>Anyone having the same issue or an idea how I could fix it ?</p>

            Even if you really are still using VISTA (not advisable!) you need to post a new Q stating exactly what has gone wrong and other useful info (like your operating system) This thread has been dormant for seven years... click
<strong>ask a q</strong> (top right) and start over - Cheers, Ric.
