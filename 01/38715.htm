            &nbsp;Hi,
<div><br />
Welcome to the Microsoft community!!<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First, let me congratulate you on getting a new laptop!<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You have mentioned that when you sign in, it says that your password is incorrect but after few tries it allows you to login. Don’t worry; we’ll definitely help you with this issue.<br />
Just a few questions first to get a clear picture of the issue;<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Are you using a Microsoft user account or a Local user account?<br />
<div>2) When did this issue start? Did you make any recent changes in the settings before this issue started?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Reset password</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>I would suggest you to first rest the password and check if it helps. If you are using a Microsoft account, you can reset the password by visiting
<a href="http://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://login.live.com/</a> and changing your password.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are using a Local account, follow these steps to reset the password:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press Windows key + C, click on settings<br />
b) Click on Change PC settings and select users in left panel<br />
c) Click on Change password under sign in options.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Switch account</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>If you are using a Microsoft account and if the above step didn’t help, then I would suggest you to switch to a local account and check. Refer these steps:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press Windows Key +C, click on settings<br />
b) Click on Change PC settings and select users in left panel<br />
c) Click on Switch to a Local account and follow the prompts<br />
d) Now, follow the same steps to switch back to a Microsoft account and check.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Where is the Favorites list in Skype Preview</h2>
                    <p>In the older version I could create a favorites list of people I talk to the most. I still have the ability to add Favorites but it doesn't seem to do anything. On the left side of my screen I just have a list called Chats that I can arrange through filters
 but I can't manually organize it other than that. There doesn't even seem to be an alphabetical option so finding people is quite arduous.</p>

<h2>            Email blocked and unable to recover.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am going to have to change my email address soon as I can not unblock my email account. I have tried a couple of times now by filling out a validation questionnaire but unfortunately because I have had the email address for such a long time it was
 hard for me to remember the precise details that I used when I created the account. They also asked about the subjects of my last sent emails and who they were sent to but what they don't understand is that I had not send an email for a very long time. I only
 really use my email for making accounts for things such as ebay, paypal, xbox live etc.</p>
<p>The Hotmail service have suggested I change my email and start out fresh. Now thats easy at first but when it comes to changing the email address linked with my xbox live account I am going to have some trouble. I can not sign into xbox.com because my email
 is blocked so I made this temp account, therefore how am I going to change it if I can not sign in to change it? I can sign into xbox live on my xbox fine but there is no option in the settings to change my information either and I am sure if there were it
 would send a confirmation email of some sort to my old email address for me to verify. I really do not know what to do because LORD FORBID if my xbox ever died on me and I had to buy a new one there is no way I could recover my account on a new xbox with a
 blocked email.</p>
<p>Some help on this would be great. Thank you.</p>
<p>Melissa.</p>

<p>I am afriad that you already have all the help you will get. &nbsp;But I am a little confused: you can sign into this site regardless of the state of your email. &nbsp;My nephew just made up an email that doesn't even really exist and he has no problem doing it. &nbsp;You
 can change the WLID no problem there...there are directions around here somewhere for that. &nbsp;And what do you mean by "unblock your email"?</p>

<p>Hi Melissa,<br />
<br />
If you have access to the account, you should have enough information on the account to be able to get the e-mail changed to something else. They do ask for security questions and answers as well as payment information used, name / address etc used.<br />
<br />
That information should be available for you to see if you look at the account portion on your Xbox 360. It should be located by signing into Xbox LIVE on your console going to Settings &gt; Account.<br />
<br />
You might want to look at that information and fill in the form using that exact information. If you don't have a payment method on file, you may want to consider adding one on there to give them some extra information at having a higher chance of getting the
 validation to pass.<br />
<br />
<span>Click this link&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong><span>, once your at that page you want to click "</span><span><strong>I think someone else is using my&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;account</strong>" and
 click Reset Password. Enter in the e-mail for the&nbsp;account, and then click "<strong>I can't use any of these options</strong>", follow through with the prompts on the rest of the pages and you'll be asked to fill in a form with as much information as possible.</span></p>

<p>I have tried this many times and it says the information I have given isn't enough. I even proved the last part of the 3 month xbox live code I last used, the last four digits of my credit card and the name on the card but still.. nothing. Looks like its
 a lost cause, if my xbox does break I'll just have to give it up. I've had my xbox live account for 5 years, I don't really want to new account. :( Also the account I am using now to post this is not my 5 year account with the blocked email, its one I made
 so I could post here and get help because I can not sign in here with my original account.

<p><span>Yes. This is, BTW, a Microsoft Account issue, not an Xbox issue; the Microsoft Account support folk have their own support forum at
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-help-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
windows.microsoft.com/.../id-help-center</a></span></p>
<p><span>0) If you already have a second Microsoft Account (formerly known as the Windows Live ID) you can skip step 1 altogether</span></p>
<p><span>1) Make a new Microsoft Account at
<a href="http://startup.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://startup.live.com</a> which after you complete it should lead you to the Account Summary</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1A) If you don't get to the Account Summary page, go to
<a href="http://Account.Live.Com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://Account.Live.Com</a> and sign in there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1B) If you are prompted to cofirm the email address, please do so.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Complete the security information by clicking on the Edit Security Info link below. Make sure to add the Security Question down below as well as a cellular number in the Phone Numbers field
 and an alternate email address which is different from the Microsoft Account address.</span></p>
<p><span>3) Then, enter
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=242792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=242792</a> in the address bar of your browser. Fill in the form there, with the subject &nbsp;EMAIL BEHIND MICROSOFT ID IS BROKEN - give a good working email where their
 support folks can find you. You should receive a response within a day, the gods willing.</span></p>

<p>Thank you, Vibroplex. I created a new email and followed your steps, hopefully this will work.
</p>
<p>Also, if I rang up the Microsoft helpline would people there be able to access my account and change my details if I was able to confirm who I was? Its seems too easy to be true though if i were that simple to sort this out. I'm having such a bad time with
 this. :(</p>

Wasn't my intention to make you think I was offended or upset. I was just preparing you for them to ask you to fill out the same information. The form they ask you to fill out on the various websites all sort of links together.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Snap Causing Docking Station Connected Dell P2715Q to Black - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david at dra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Snap Causing Docking Station Connected Dell P2715Q to Black Out</h2>
                    <p>I have an i5 256G Surface Pro 3 running WIN 10 and with the Intel HD Graphics 4400 Display Adapter.&nbsp; I have been successfully using a Dell 2715Q external monitor connected directly to the SP3 by an HDMI to mini-DP cable and displaying 3840x2160 at 30 HZ.&nbsp;
 (Never could get DP to mini-DP cable&nbsp;to work or to realize the desirable 60 HZ for true 4K at this resolution.)&nbsp; I recently very successfully upgraded with a new Surface Pro 4 Fingerprint cover type-pad and thought I would also try the new "brick" Docking
 Station to simplify cables and perhaps add another screen.&nbsp; The Dell P2715Q is listed by MS as a supported monitor.&nbsp; The first Docking Station was very unsuccessful - almost immediately the screen would go black, sometimes&nbsp;displaying a message that&nbsp;the resolution
 and&nbsp;frequency were wrong when they were exactly as stated.&nbsp; After following the MS trouble shooting guidelines and talking with an MS rep with no solution found, I returned the Docking Station and a new one was sent.&nbsp; This one works a little better (though
 as I sit here typing this it is flashing on and off).&nbsp; One issue that seems especially acute is if Windows Snap is used to place a program/app into a half or corner of the screen, this causes the screen to go black.&nbsp; This will also frequently happen if the
 app window is moved near the top or a side.&nbsp; This can been done by continuing to hold on to the top of the window with the mouse and moving it in and out, even after the screen goes black.&nbsp; Moving it back away will cause the screen to go back to normal.&nbsp; This
 behavior does not occur with a direct connection to the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this Docking Station also flawed, or is this a software or settings issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the Surface Pro 3 unable to manage this through the Docking Station?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need an "Active" mini-DP to HDMI female adapter, which then connects to an HDMI to HDMI cable? (If so, why?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have a Dell P2715Q external monitor working with the Docking Station?</p>

            Hi Joy,&nbsp; Thank you, but I gave up and have the Docking Station packaged for return and refund.&nbsp; I bought this
<strong>expensive</strong> Docking Station to simplify my life.&nbsp; Instead it turned into a nightmare.&nbsp; This should have been a simple plug-in experience.&nbsp; How could one possibly design the Docking Station circuitry so that&nbsp;the mini-display ports do&nbsp;not accomplish
 exactly the same thing as the mini-display port that is located directly on the Surface Pro 3 itself?&nbsp; ... yet it seems that MS found a way.&nbsp; This product needs to be pulled from the market and properly redesigned.

<h2>            Windows 10 Does Not Update &#40;latest update 12&#47;14&#47;2015&#41;</h2>
                    <p>According to the "update" history on one of my Windows 10 computers the latest update loaded is 12/14/2015. My other machines have updates from January of this year.
</p>
<p>
If I start the update process from the "settings" app it just keeps displaying "Checking for updates ...." but never loads an update. I have already run the Windows Update Troubleshooter (as admin) and it can't "identify" the problem.</p>

            <p>FIXED!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>While researching this issue, one suggestion was to boot in "safe" mode and attempt the download. I was able to get safe mode but couldn't get safe mode with network. I rebooted not in safe mode and it just started doing the missing updates???????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has been a real pain since I updated from 8.1. I have lost one machine completely and had to pay to have it restored since I couldn't even get it into safe mode after the Windows 10 upgrade from 8.1. The other machine erred out after the upgrade
 but a safe mode reboot fix it.&nbsp; Why would a safe mode reboot fix things? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I knew more about about Linux or Mac tech, this is giving me more reason to make the switch.</p>

            <p>1. We're dealing with only one (1) computer in this thread. Was the computer running Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 before you upgraded to Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a. In File (Windows) Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>ESET</strong> &lt;=this folder</em>
</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>2b. Have you ever run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</li></ul>
<p>

<p>
4. Do you have backups of ALL the changes&nbsp;CCleaner's&nbsp;Registry Cleaner component has&nbsp;EVER made to the computer?
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Injudicious use of registry cleaners may&nbsp;have been&nbsp;playing a role here, too&nbsp;- and if so, it may play a role in the very near future, as well.<br />
<br />
</li><li>TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't),

            <p>1. THE ONE MACHINE was updated from 8.1</p>
<p>2a Thursday, ‎October ‎15, ‎2015, ‏‎7:34:37 PM</p>
<p>2b No</p>
<p>3. 12/19/2015</p>
<p>4. Yes I back up Reg file every time I run CCleaner registry tool. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the links and the 'non-support" of registry cleaner products notice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft also don't support issues of Windows upgrades that go terribly wrong. It cost me $200 to have one of my machines totally rebuilt that upgraded from 8.1 to Window 10. It would not reboot. All It would say was that there was a problem with the upgrade,
 every time it would boot. I couldn't even get it to boot in safe mode. And I was not the only person in the world that had the same issue after the upgrade and had to shell out funds from their own pocket to "fix" the Windows 10 upgrade.
It's for this reason I get concerned with every update that Windows 10 now "forces" upon users, without any promise that you may not lose your machine. Does it sound like I may be angry?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that many of the articles criticizing the use of registry cleaner tools say that it would be
<strong>better to reinstall Windows. Why the **** should an operating system go so bad that the best solution is to reinstall the operating system!!??</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Windows since version 2 and have been mostly happy but since Windows 10 I m not a happy camper.</p>

Please note, an odd issue i'm having i just noticed is i don't get updates from Windows, it always just says i'm up to date.&nbsp;<br />
If i go to Troubleshoot and click "Windows Update" it stops right after clicking it and asks to run as a admin. After this i get a message saying&nbsp;<br />

After hitting apply i get&nbsp;<br />

<p>I can re-run this again and get this same issue, Could these 2 issues be linked?<br />
<br />
I also did a SFC scannow with no issues.</p>
<p><br />
Check issue with Windows Store apps got this back<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Corrupted profile data, an outdated version of the app, and software conflicts that occur when signing in are some of the factors that we have to take into consideration when troubleshooting issues with signing in to the Xbox app on Windows 10. Let's isolate
 your concern by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your device or to your Xbox account before encountering this issue?</li><li>Are you using the same Microsoft account to sign in to the Xbox app and your Windows 10 PC?</li><li>Are you using an administrator user profile?</li><li>Have you tried signing in to other built-in Windows 10 apps like the Store app to check if the same issue occurs?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest signing in to a different user profile. This can help determine if this is due to corrupted user data. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>button on your device or keyboard, or select the
<strong>Windows</strong> icon from the bottom-left corner of the main screen.</span></li><li><span>Select your account name from the top-left corner of the menu, and then select
<strong>Switch </strong>account.</span></li><li><span>Sign in with an account other than the one you were using.</span></li><li><span>Sign in to the<strong> Xbox app</strong> and check if the same issue occurs.</span></li></ol>

<strong>Not that i remember</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Are you using the same Microsoft account to sign in to the Xbox app and your Windows 10 PC?<br />
<strong>I don't sign in using a Email or an account on Windows 10, just the app.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Are you using an administrator user profile?<br />
<strong>Yep, Only user on this PC full admin rights.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried signing in to other built-in Windows 10 apps like the Store app to check if the same issue occurs?<br />
<strong>I'm currently signed in to the store, Seems to be working just fine.</strong></li></ul>
<br />
I'll report back once i have done the switch of accounts.

<p><strong>I was checking if my load windows was correct as some tips point to this as a fix. Mine was set to Normal startup, but Xbox Live Auth Manager is set to stopped, is this normal?</strong><br />

<p>We understand the urgency to have this issue resolved. Reinstalling your operating system is the final option to try. We suggest creating a new profile first. This can help determine if this is due to corrupted user data. As for the steps, see

Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10</a> for the steps. Sign in to the app using the new profile and check if the same issue occurs.

<p>Okay, so i'm finding out why i might have been getting issues with the Xbox Sign app. First Windows 10 Pro 64 bit installs my network as a public network. Second, it seems the update service just never installs anything, like it just sits and never updates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So digging around, this might be because i had my ethernet cable plugged in during install and it did something wrong with networking. This could be the reason why i was having issues in my other post about admin rights with OS drive while installing drivers
 for my music programs.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As this doesn't mean it has to be the sole reason, as it could also be the windows creation tool might have a bad image, as i used this both times during install.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All i did during this new install was use a Samsung 128 Gb USB and format to 32 Gb with a 10Gb file size (The rest was not used).<br />
I started my computer with the USB setup in the bios as boot device and started the Windows install. AT the point it asks to install windows to the SSD (Samsung 840 Evo SS) i deleted all old files and selected next. I'm going to try a new install with no internet
 connected and also check my bios settings to make sure it's not blocking something.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I do want to note that, new windows install needs to be fixed, like Windows update will state it's out of date and just never download (i waited 30 mins and nothing), but while this is going on Candy Crush and other apps i never asked to be installed are. I'm
 lost for words as how this is accepted for a pro copy of an OS. <br />
I might install Mac OS and test my system out and use WIndows 10 in a VM.<br />
<br />
I found the very first copy of Windows 10 online and i'll test how that go's. This might be my last few days on this OS.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Okay installed Windows 10 64 bit 2015 ISO. I'll update this once Windows updates to test Xbox App.

            After testing everything on the computer, i kept asking my self why only Microsoft services would be not working, as Google Chrome and Edge worked just fine. I then looked at my Router. Issue seems to be fixed. I'm calling Belkin right away and also putting
 a review about that product.<br />
<br />

 of the issue. My bad on thinking it was Microsoft. Hope this helps someone.</span></li></ul>

<p>Almost certainly it's gone. Copy it by hand from the gray printout<br />
(although you can perhaps use an OCR program on the first, non-gray,<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the keyboard?</p>
<p>2. Have you configured the wireless keyboard before?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To setup wireless keyboard, follow these steps:</strong></p>
<p>a. Plug the receiver for the keyboard into an empty USB port on the computer. Wait for Windows to detect the receiver and configure it for use.</p>
<div>
<p>b. Install the batteries in the compartment on the bottom of the keyboard.</p>
<div>
<p>c. Press the "Connect" or "Locate" button on the receiver.&nbsp; Press the same type of button on the bottom of the wireless keyboard. They receiver will synchronize with the keyboard and you should be able to use it at that point.</p>
<p>d. If the drivers are not installed automatically, you may have to install the drivers for the wireless keyboard which is provided by the manufacturer.

                    <p style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">
Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">
For a few days I have a problem with wireless Xbox360 controller on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (compilation 15063.483).&nbsp;Still a few days ago everything workes fine, I was able to turn on and turn off my controller&nbsp;into the any way, and system always saw the controller.&nbsp;Unfortunately
 now my controller works fine only after the system starts, until controller is turned off (removing battery or after 10 min of inactivity) and when I try to re-enable controller, system doesn't see controller (however diode will work on controller) or see
 (and not work) but if try open properties in Games controllers I get information that isn't connected.&nbsp;Additionaly, there is no sound of connection new device when re-connecting controller. Only helps to disconnect and reconnect receiver from USB, however
 then on controller a diode is changing to next (eg. it is normally light #1,&nbsp;after the first reconnection of the receiver, it lights up #2, next #3 and #4. Later&nbsp;is no any light).&nbsp;This is quite annoying because after controller&nbsp;turn off, I need restart game
 because pad will not be decteded again. Doesn't help installing software for Xbox 360 Controller, doesn't help format c:\, and doesn't help pressing pairing buttons.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">
Does anyone using Xbox 360 wireless controller? Do you have similar problems? Maybe someone knows how to solve this?</p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I suggest you to perform
<strong>System File Checker</strong> (SFC) scan.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>System File Checker</span></strong><span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows
 system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I would also suggest you to run the System update readiness command. It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version
 available. Follow the steps.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            how to change owner of computer without losing data</h2>
                    We bought our ten year old grandson a computer for Xmas and before we could set it up...he did it. &nbsp;Now we notice he is going to some sites he shouldn't be and when I try to set up a family safety, I can't. &nbsp;I have used his sign in to make me an administrator
 but he still has control of the computer and can delete me. &nbsp;So if I disconnect his account will I lose all his files? &nbsp;I don't want that to happen. &nbsp;I just want to put some restrictions on youtube that he cannot change. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated. Thanks&nbsp;

    <title>Surface pen tip not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> expectingrain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pen tip not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a surface pen with the clip and one hidden button on the flat edge. The tip of the pen has suddenly stopped working altogether. The top button works for clicking, but not erasing. I've tried all recommended steps (checking the battery, making sure
 there is no lint or obstruction in the interior of the pen, checking for updates, unpairing and repairing the pen bluetooth, changing the tip with a pen tip kit I purchased). Nothing has worked. Is there anything else I could try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any suggestions.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t run &#39;Battlefield Vietnam&#39; on Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennis laursen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t run &#39;Battlefield Vietnam&#39; on Win 7</h2>
                    <p>I have problem with playing Battlefield Vietnam (the one from 2004) on my conputer with Windows 7. The strange thing is that I could run it with Win 98 compatibility mode before. But now it won't even run. When I run the game, either by icon or the CD start
 menu, I get the hourglass for a second or two, and then nothing happens.</p>
<p>I still have the original CD from 2004, which I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a anti-virus false positive (I use Norton) issue, or is it&nbsp;a issue related to Win 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help.</p>

            It's probably because that Windows 7 no longer support disk-based games or because that your GPU driver is old or not support this game.I still don't know the real problem but you should check it.

<p>
</p><p>OK. So it is a Windows 7 update, that causes the problem? Because a year ago, on the same computer, I did not have problems with launching the game.</p>
<p>Isn't there any workaround for this?</p>

<h2>            Games from older versions of Windows</h2>
                    At 70 years of age, I don't have any real desire to play games on the Internet.&nbsp; I would really like to be able to install my favorite games from older versions of Windows (95, 97, XP, and 7), but Windows 10 won't let me do it.&nbsp; I sure could use some guidance
 on how to install <em>mshearts, Pegged, Pipe, Solitaire, Tetris, and Winmine (Minesweeper)</em> on Windows 10.&nbsp; I have tried running the compatibility stuff, but it doesn't work.&nbsp; Is there a site that has these older games on that I can use to download to
 my computer.

<h3> kenwd0elq  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP cannot connect&#59; ipconfig displays nothing</h2>
                    
<div>Hi, folks. I've seen this question asked before, but I haven't seen an answer that works for this situation.<br />
<br />
I've been running Windows XP for the last few years, and this system is now at SP3. It was probably just a fluke, but I was installing an interesting WiFi monitoring program yesterday (<a href="http://www.freewarefiles.com/MyWIFIzone_program_14124.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freewarefiles.com/MyWIFIz...ram_14124.html</a>
 , if you're interested - but DO NOT install this!). It prompted for a reboot, so I did. The PC wouldn't come back up, so I rebooted again; same thing. So I rebooted into Safe Mode, and discovered that I couldn't uninstall software in Safe Mode. I deleted the
 program directory, and rebooted again. <br />
<br />
Now the fun started. Windows prompted me to reactivate XP Pro SP3, because of "significant hardware changes". But I couldn't, because I couldn't connect to the network - ANY network. I opened a cmd wiindow and tried "ipconfig /all", which returned "Windows
 IP Configuration" and _nothing else_. <br />
<br />
I started getting errors about NCS2PROV.exe, which is apparently the network driver for my Intel 965DH motherboard, so I removed the LAN connection, reinstalled the drivers and re-enabled it. No luck. I figured that the onboard network connection had failed
 so I tried installing a USB WiFi device, with no success. I even tried doing a repair of Windows, without success. I tried looking for a restore point, but for some reason there are none prior to the crash and the oldest one didn't help.<br />
<br />
At this point, Windows still is nagging to reactivate, I have no network connectivity on this machine AT ALL, and I have tried everything I can think of. I've spent the last day googling every variation on this problem that I could think of, and have tried
 everything suggested.&nbsp; Nothing has worked. <br />
<br />
At this point, I'm grasping at straws. Any suggestions, before I nuke the system and reinstall Windoze from scratch? Thanks.</div>
