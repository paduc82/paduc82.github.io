            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Were you able to connect to the chat server earlier?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:
</strong>Check if the program </span><span>is compatible with Windows 7. You can verify the compatibility of most of the hardware and software with Windows 7 on the following website.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the software and check if the issue persists. Refer the following link
 to uninstall the program from the programs and features.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists then, I would suggest you to contact the software support regarding the issue.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>What is the expected behaviour with wireless headsets that use a USB transceiver? I have this exact issue and it would be great if only one controller was in use the console auto assigned the headset to that controller.</p><p><br /></p><p>As it stands I’ve tried:</p><p><br /></p><p>1. Connecting the controller first, then turning on the headset. It doesn’t assign &amp; I&nbsp;have to manually go into the Accessories app and assign it.</p><p>2. Connect the headset first, then turn on the controller. Same thing. Does not assign.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is frustrating and if as intended please raise as something to be fixed. We should be able to either lock a headset to a gamer tag (like we can with a controller) or have an option to assign to controller if only one connected, or even better have a pop up dialog when an unassigned headset is detected allowing a quick assignment each time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Shane.</p>

<p>Hey guys! I actually JUST fixed this issue by simply unplugging the usb and plugging it back in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Before this I tried unpairing, and repairing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried just about every audio setting on xbox and googling it 1,000 times with no reward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox should seriously make a way to assign headsets to different profiles and/or controllers since this is a feature for basically all wireless headsets</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Acer laptop stuck in infinite boot loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willtrowbridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Acer laptop stuck in infinite boot loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm using Windows 8.1 on my Acer laptop. One day, I saw a popup saying that my computer will automatically restart soon to update, but I could also update now. So, from my start screen, I selected "Update and restart", and then I got the "Restarting"
 screen with the animation of a ring of white dots that appears out of nowhere, spins around in a circle, disappears into nowhere, and the loop repeats. However, it froze after about 30 seconds on that screen, so I manually held down the power button and pressed
 it again to restart it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But now I'm stuck in an infinite boot loop:</p>
<p>1. Shows "Acer: explore beyond limits" logo, with the same animation described as before, a ring of white dots that appears out of nowhere, spins around in a circle, disappears into nowhere, and the loop repeats.<br />
2. After about five seconds, however, it suddenly freezes for about one second.<br />
3. Comes up with a light-blue error screen with white text. It shows a gigantic ":(" frowny face, and below it, the message "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you. (0% complete)",
 and additionally, in small print below, it also says "If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: ACPI_BIOS_ERROR". The "(0% complete)" goes through several percentages over a period of several seconds, up to 100%, and then the
 laptop restarts itself.<br />
4. Shows "Acer: explore beyond limits" logo, with the same animation described as before, a ring of white dots that appears out of nowhere, spins around in a circle, disappears into nowhere, and the loop repeats. This time, however, there is also white text
 at the bottom which reads "Preparing Automatic Repair".<br />
5. After about five seconds, however, it suddenly freezes for about one second.<br />
6. Comes up with a light-blue error screen with white text. It shows a gigantic ":(" frowny face, and below it, the message "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you. (0% complete)",
 and additionally, in small print below, it also says "If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: ACPI_BIOS_ERROR". The "(0% complete)" goes through several percentages over a period of several seconds, up to 100%, and then the
 laptop restarts itself.<br />
7. Goes back to 1.</p>
<p>I am now at the point where I can't even use my computer anymore. Is there any solution that doesn't get rid of all my personal files?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you time and effort.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ACPI_BIOS_ERROR bug check has a value of 0x000000A5. This bug check indicates that the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) BIOS of the computer is not fully compliant with the ACPI specification. For more information regarding this error,
 please refer to this MSDN article:<br />
</p>

</p><p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff560114(v=vs.85).aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff560114%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had Windows 8 previously and are unable to boot the computer to its Start Screen, then you will have to use the Windows 8 installation or recovery disc to perform an Automatic Repair or a System Restore by booting the computer from the disc. If you
 do not have one, then you can create it and then boot the computer from it to perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8. To create a Windows 8 installation media, you may refer to the article given below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating the disc, boot the computer from the disc and then try the following method to perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8 using the installation media.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a)&nbsp;Contact the computer manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows 8 installation disk.<br />
b)&nbsp;In the “Windows Setup” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “Next”.<br />
c)&nbsp;Click on “Repair your computer” from the lower left corner.<br />
d)&nbsp;From the “Choose an option screen”, click on “Troubleshoot”.<br />
e)&nbsp;Click “Advanced Options” in the “Troubleshoot” screen.<br />
f)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the “Advanced Options” screen, click “Automatic Repair”.<br />
g)&nbsp;Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Automatic Repair.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, try booting the computer. If the Automatic Repair does not help, then try performing a System Restore from the “Advanced Options” and check if that helps.<br />
Perform a System restore and check.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform a System Restore, follow these instructions and check:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a)&nbsp;Contact the computer manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows 8 installation disk.<br />
b)&nbsp;In the “Windows Setup” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “Next”.<br />
c)&nbsp;Click on “Repair your computer” from the lower left corner.<br />
d)&nbsp;From the “Choose an option screen”, click on “Troubleshoot”.<br />
e)&nbsp;Click “Advanced Options” in the “Troubleshoot” screen.<br />
f)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the “Advanced Options” screen, select “System Restore”.<br />
g)&nbsp;Follow the on screen instructions to restore the computer to an earlier state when the computer was working fine.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, check if you are able to boot the computer successfully. If yes, then try updating the computer BIOS and the chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer’s website and check if that resolves the issue. It would be better to contact the computer manufacturer
 for further assistance with this, because updating BIOS and chipset drivers include risky procedures and if anything goes wrong, that would leave the computer unstable or unusable.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
 configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
</p>

            You may have to contact Microsoft Technical Support.&nbsp; That is the BIOS and if you are getting that, the SSD card may be corrupted.

    <title>Skype STILL won&#39;t let me sign in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype STILL won&#39;t let me sign in</h2>
                    <p>This issue still has not been resolved, so I am asking it again to hopefully get some actual help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;It started when I changed my password for my email, which was attached to Skype. Ever since then, when I have tried to log in to Skype, (with new and old passwords to try everything), it doesn't give me an error message
 or anything. It just pops p the window to input my password again, after I had entered my password already. I have uninstalled Skype 4 times on my computer, and updated my computer as well, and still nothing. Skype works just fine on my phone with the new
 password, but it won't let me sign in on my laptop. Even going to the Skype login in the browser won't let me sign in; for a week now all I get is this message "</span><span>It looks like there was a problem with Skype, please try again later.</span><span>".&nbsp;
 I don't know what else to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling skype onto my computer, several times actually. I am using windows 10, and have tried installing the different versions of skype just to double check. I have also not had
 any luck signing in to skype via the internet. I have however had luck signing into skype on my phone with the same password I changed it to, so I know it's not the wrong password.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks again for the help.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to install Windows updates error code 66A&#47;80070308.</h2>
                    <p>OT: Several update failures, Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Updates were fine till recently. Today I noticed on the report that 5 updates had failed. Scrolled back through the history to find that the first failure occurred in August last year (I hadn't checked) with Windows Update Agent (7.6.7600.320) failing on
 a code 800705B4. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All okay till January 14th when a security update for Windows 7 (KB3023266) failed on code 80244019.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the five today: </p>
<p>Update for Microsoft .NET framework 4 (KB2468871) failure on code 66A</p>
<p>Update for Microsoft .NET framework (KB2600217) failure on code 66A</p>
<p>Security update for Windows 7 (KB2984981) on code 80070308</p>
<p>Security update for Windows 7 (KB2984976) on code 80070308</p>
<p>Security update for Windows 7 (KB3020388) on code 80070308</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I clicked on one on the update history list, I got the Windows help and support window with five more codes listed; clicking on those led me to the Windows Update Troubleshooter which told me that there were problems installing recent updates (Well,
 duh!) and that wasn't fixed, and that service registration missing or corrupt was fixed. Restart didn't help, neither did any suggestions I found elsewhere that made any sense to me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran scannow - no problems. Done all I think I can manage- thing is, I'm new to all this and now feel quite lost. I'd really appreciate some clear steps to follow to try to resolve these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, in anticipation, to anyone who can help.</p>

<p><span>You'll need to provide a user name and password so that Windows Backup can access the network location. If you can access the network location
 from the Computer folder on your computer without having to type a user name or password, type the user name and password that you used to log on to the computer into the Windows Backup UI.

<h2>            Notifications delayed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 version 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of my notifications are delayed. Sometime, I have to wait a very long time before they show up. Some notifications appear only if another notification has be displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I plug in my external hard drive, I won't get the notification telling that I have to select an action. The first notification will be displayed only if another notification has to be displayed. For example, if I receive an email. The first
 notification will show up. Thereafter, if I close the first notification, the notification about my e-mail will be displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug is not always reproducible. If i restart my computer, it fixes temporarily&nbsp;the problem. The problem will occur again after some time.</p>

<p>No, you can't merge a local profile with an already existing Xbox Live account, it is only possible to 'upgrade' that local profile to a new Xbox Live account. If you want to do that see the steps on this link: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/offline-profile-to-gamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../offline-profile-to-gamertag</a></p>

    <title>The First Cross Platform Game&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The First Cross Platform Game&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well sort of, The Golf Cub made by HB studios will allow cross platform sharing. They had to get a special waiver from both Sony and MS for this to happen, How you ask?</p>
<p>Well the game has a course creator, so if I design a course on my XBone, then someone with a PS4 can use my course on that console and vice versa.</p>
<p>Just think with this sort of cooperation between the 2 console rivals, anything is possible, who knows, in the future we could be on the same course playing the same round of golf or even in a multiplayer lobby on a FPS game with our friends who have a PS4.
 OK maybe this is expecting a bit too much but it just shows that it may be possible. Maybe with the Xbox 5 and PS8.</p>

 a few years before its time considering Titanfall does the same thing)</p>

<p>Ye, cross console game............could be the first "cross console" game, though the argument could still go against it as I believe there are a number of PS Vita/PSP Vs PS3 games out there.</p>
<p>Definitely the first to go between two rival consoles.</p>

            <p>It may be going between Sony and MS consoles, but in a very minimal way. It's still a long leap to getting cross-ecosystem real-time multiplayer gaming.</p>
<p>As for cross-platform gaming, Happy Wars is promising that for its release on Xbox One you will be able to play against people on the 360.</p>

            Hello Rafa. This problem can be from many things but namely I think it may be a GPU driver.
<br />
<br />First I would go through this page here about using Microsoft Easy fix it solutions: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/297090...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work then look to updating you GPU
<br />
<br />We can also go to the Device Manager to update your Display driver. Please follow these steps:
<br />
<br />    Press Windows key + R to open the Run command box.
<br />    Type devmgmt.msc, then press Enter.
<br />    Click the arrow beside Display adapters to expand.
<br />    Double left click on the Display adapter and go to Driver tab.
<br />    Click Update Driver.       
        </p>

            Hi Rafa,
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<h2>            Hitting error &#34;Sharing violation&#34; for file BCD when using xcopy command to copy the system files from the primary EFI partition to the Shadow EFI partition on Windows 7</h2>
                    I would like te establish software mirroring of the boot disk on a Windows 7 Professional system. As per document How to Establish and Boot to GPT Mirrors on 64-bit Windows ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/814070 ) I am stuck at step 8 where it comes
 to using xcopy command to copy the system files from the primary EFI partition to the Shadow EFI partition. I hit the following error:<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;xcopy p:\*.* s: /s /h<br />
P:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD<br />
Sharing violation<br />
<br />
The document mentioned applies to Windows Server 2003 but I can not find an adequate document for Windows 7. How can I perform the same task on Windows 7 Professional?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regrards,<br />

            I agree also, it totally confuses any search engine including MS Bing as well as Google. It also displays a certain lack of understanding how such thing are supposed to work in the modern world.

            Exactly the same problem. Doesn't matter if I use Chrome or Edge, I can no longer check out all the images in a theme before downloading (or not downloading) which is a retrograde step. I can also no longer uncheck images I like less.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello David,</p>
<p>Thank you for the info, it was exactly what I asked for. So what it seems is that there is something blocking a single download for some unknown reason. It happens, but usually (not always!) for a reason.&nbsp; What that reason is I don't know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would like to suggest is to try another printer download. This time, manually select the operating system as Vista 64 Bit. Does that one download? If yes, then you're in business, you can run it in Compatibility Mode (and tell Epson they have a problem
 with their Win 7 (x64) driver!). If not then I don't know what to look for!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other option (alone or in combination with the above method) is to go through Windows Update, and look for printer models that are in the same family, i.e., you have the 4535, what do the 4530 and 4533 look like? Is there a next higher model that resembles
 yours in functions and appearance? What drivers do they use? It'll take some sleuthing but you may be able to find a very compatible / close driver that'll work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither method is ideal, but one of them might do the trick. They're worth the try, I think. Post back here with your results and let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I turned on my computer this morning and got a message that said: "Corruption has been detected in your Feature Manager Settings. Backup has been loaded."</p>
<p>I clicked ok because I did not know what else to do, but I am&nbsp;concerned by this&nbsp;message.&nbsp;I just downloaded Microsoft Security Essentials a couple of days ago. I also have Super Anti-Spyware running on my computer.&nbsp; I run scans just about every day because
 I had a trojan&nbsp;virus (or whatever it is)&nbsp;in my system a few weeks ago. The trojan was removed. What is going on with my computer? Microsoft Security Essentials&nbsp;is telling me&nbsp;my computer is fine and "protected". Super Anti-Spyware is reporting the same thing...&nbsp;A
 tech friend said&nbsp;I can&nbsp;have more than one security program on my laptop.&nbsp; He said there would not be a conflict between the programs I have now.&nbsp; I cannot take my computer in for repairs. Here are a few more details:&nbsp; I have read related threads. I do not
 have AT and T service. My internet provider is TMobile and I have an old HP Pavilion Laptop. It&nbsp;has VISTA.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help please.&nbsp;I would greatly appreciate any assistance.&nbsp;I am scared to run my laptop, and am worried about my&nbsp;files!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If the vendor is unable to assist then you will need to (a) ensure the communications program is compatible with Windows Vista (b) uninstall the current program, restart PC, reinstall the compatible program by right clicking and choose "run as administrator".
 (c) disable antivirus whilst installing the program. </p>

 Windows will notify me if there is a solution. I have called Canon and it is not a program issue. What needs to happen for this to get solved. My career is based on filming so I need this program running ASAP!!!!! Please help.</p>

<h2>            ASUS N56JN -  Shut Down when reinstall ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery, Battery 0&#37; available &#40;plugged in, charging&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.<br />
It is a week that i try to solve this problem. I have a laptop ASUS N56JN with Windows 10, re-installed today. I bought a new Rechargeable battery 4 days ago, because with the old one when i plugged out AC cable my computer shutdown, so i think that&nbsp; the battery
 is dead.<br />
I inserted the new one but the problem persisted and the battery icon said "Battery 0% available (plugged in, charging)". I did try all solutions that i can find. I also
<span>bought </span>DriverBooster PRO and updated all drivers for Windows (that i have reinstalled today). Not fixed.
<span>bought </span>DriverBooster PRO and updated all drivers for Windows (that i have reinstalled today). Not fixed.
</p>
<p>So i try to disable manually&nbsp;ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery from Device Manager in Control Panel. When I enable it, my computer shut down and i don't know why.<br />
I think that is a BIOS Problem but my Bios is update at the last version on Asus site: 203 version.<br />
Someone can help me?&nbsp;Thanks in advance :)</p>

Thanks Vijay.<br />
I just try all the 4 point but. No fix. I have to add to my problem descriptiom that when the PC is turn off and the AC cable is disconnected , it fails to turn on. And also if i try to disconnect the AC cable when it is turn on, it goes off. It's a problem
 inside the computer with power connectors? But if this is the problem why my computer detects my battery when i insert in and shut down?</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for help me :)!!</p>
<p>I think the problem is with battery report. The command says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; <strong>powercfg /batteryreport</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"The operation cannot be performed. An unexpected error occurred (0X10D2): library, drive, or empty media pool."</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that battery is not detected? But why when i insert battery, the icon in the Start Bar report that the battery is under charge? and why the Computer goes off when I insert it? this means that there is a "electrical connection" i suppose…</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you're experiencing with XPS Viewer might be due to corrupted Windows system files. We suggest that you try to run the System File Checker scan to replace and fix missing or corrupted system files. Here is an
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026529/windows-10-using-system-file-checker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to help you out.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, Patricia. However I will hold back on running the System File Check. That thing bit me a couple of times in the past replacing updated versions of system files with older versions making some programs not work.</p>
<p>As I said, I have this behavior on all 4 of my computers, 3 of them running Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit&nbsp;and one running Windows 10 Pro, 32-bit. Since all 4 computers got this problem after installing the Fall Creator's update last October I think it's more likely
 the problem to be with the update than the same file corruption of 4 different computers.</p>
<p>I'll check other computers if I get access to them.</p>
<p>In the mean time I switched using the PDF printer so it's not a rush.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same problem with the XPS viewer crashing when I try to copy text. I used to copy text from it all the time because I was saving my receipts for online purchases by printing them to XPS files and then copying information from the XPS files
 to my accounting software (Quicken).</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you're experiencing with XPS Viewer might be due to corrupted Windows system files. We suggest that you try to run the System File Checker scan to replace and fix missing or corrupted system files. Here is an

</p><p>Kindly update us on the results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Patricia, I just used the system file checker (sfc /scannow) and that made no difference. I also used the Windows Media Creation Tool to re-install Windows 10 and that made no difference either. I still cannot copy any information from an XPS file using
 the XPS viewer file without having the viewer crash.</p>

<p>Thanks for replying so soon, Matt. It sounds as though the Fall Creator's Update might be the cause. Maybe a lot of us should get together and urge a solution to the problem. Running a system file check and re-installing Windows didn't do any good, so far.<br />

<p><strong><span>Problem:<br />
- I am not able to connect to desktop machine using the remote connection.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Tried:<br />

-entered IP address and then username and password<br />
*** failed connection******</span></strong></p>
<p>Quick Question also:<br />
- I am running behind a router with 3 machines connected to the router, would this change my IP address location? I think this is where i am stuck at.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>To be able to connect to a remote computer, the remote computer has to be ready to accept the connection.</p>
<p>That includes the setting in the OS to accept remote help, and opening the listening port of the Remote Desktop (RDT)</p>
<p>To port has to be open through the software firewall and forwarded trough the Router to the computer IP.</p>
<p>The default port of RDT is 3382.</p>
<p>Since a port can be forwarded only to one IP if you need to remote to few computers that are on the same network, you need to change the ports of other computers to be unique, and forward each port to the IP of the corresponded computer.</p>
<p>This page deals with other remote software, but there is description toward the end of the technique mentioned above.</p>

            What is the make and model of the printer?
<br />
<br />Connect the printer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Add printer
<br />
<br />Click 'The printer what I want isn't listed'
<br />
<br />Select 'Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings'
<br />Select 'Use an existing port'
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Under Manufacturer, scroll down then select the printer brand
<br />Over the right hand side, scroll down through the list and look for your printer model.
<br />
<br />If you don't see it, click Windows Update and wait while Windows Update checks for the printer.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't find it, click the back button, then click Next again.
<br />
<br />This time, select printer brand and in the printer list, select a driver series that closely matches your printer model

Hi,<br />
<br />
I also have the same problem. Mine was Windows 7. My second Local Drive/ Local Disk cannot be open. When I opened 'My Computer' , my second Local Drive/ Local Disk didn't show how many space left in memory. It only show the name. When I click it, computer doesn't
 respond for few minutes then it crashes. My antivirus also doesn't respond for few minutes then it crashes. When I want to restore back my computer, System Restore cannot be open. Factory Reset also cannot be open. I mean all of things like videos, music,
 cannot be open. Please suggest some solution. All of my important things such as work, document, videos, music are all in my second Local Drive/ Local Disk. Please help me out. Thank you very much!!
