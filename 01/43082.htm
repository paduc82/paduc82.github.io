<h2>            Compatibility issues &#38; crashes</h2>
                    <div>[EDIT June 12th -, OMG... I figured I'd go back to AMD's website and re-install their display driver one last time to see if it may fix the issue, and... all the problems below are now gone, BUT it has reverted back to the exact same original problem in
 my first question!&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/display-issue-when-playing-certain-games/22855f64-992c-4352-8d72-1f52a7bc5d19">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/display-issue-when-playing-certain-games/22855f64-992c-4352-8d72-1f52a7bc5d19</a>&nbsp;
 certain games will play in fullscreen with that corrupted graphics issue but look fine with ALT+enter in windowed mode... absolutely baffled, I'm going in circles]</div>
<div><br />
</div>
This has branched out from an earlier problem I asked about, but I decided to clarify this issue in a new question.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The main issue is a lot of programs/games are not working correctly/or not at all unless I go to properties of each one and change the compatibility mode (doesn't seem to matter which mode), if I don't change the mode they either run with glitches and
 other problems, or won't open at all...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Although there are other problems I cannot fix (or change the compatibility to possibly fix), like if I right click on "computer" and click "properties" it opens for a split second but crashes my explorer.. &nbsp;and it restarts,&nbsp;<span>but all explorer programs
 close and don't reopen with it.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I also cannot get windows photo viewer to open any image files it just opens for a split second and closes too.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>I have no idea what could be affecting every single program on my computer in this way, I have not installed anything significant lately, and the only recent changes were updates to my graphics/display driver for my "<b>ATI radeon HD 5700 series</b>" &amp;
 my monitors driver through device manager</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My specs are:</div>
<div>
<div><b>Windows 7 home premium 64-bit (6.1, build 7601)</b></div>
<div><b>Model: VT665AA-ABG HPE-195a</b></div>
<div><b>BIOS: 06/25/10 11:11:05 Ver: 5.15</b></div>
<div><b>Processor: Intel core i7 CPU 860@2.80 GHz (8cpus), ~2.8ghz</b></div>
<div><b>8gb RAM</b></div>
<div><b>DirectX 11</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>I also cannot open DxDiag normally now, I get this error message pop up now:</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><i>"DxDiag has detected that there might have been a problem accessing Direct3D the last time this program was used, would you like to bypass direct3D this time?"</i></b></div>
</div>
<div>If I say yes it opens, if I say no it crashes.. here's the saved info from dxdiag:</div>

            <p>Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have been experiencing major problems with crashing in Windows 7 both 32 bit and 64 bit. I tried all the solutions so far posted i.e. Catalyst 9.7 drivers, underclocking the graphics card using ATI tool, setting core affinity, disabling the ATi HD&nbsp;Audio device
 but with no success. The game just kept crashing and there was no particular patterns to it. Plus when it crashed, it didn't just take out the game (as drivers usually do), it pretty much rendered all software useless as eveything would crash (Firefox, Internet
 Explorer) which resulted in a reboot everytime it crashed which got pretty tedious I can tell you!<br />
<br />
I was pretty much convinced that it can't be down to drivers as Windows 7 32 bit and 64 bit use totally different driver models.<br />
<br />
When I studied these forums I found that the problem doesn't appear to be isolated to ATi users either, some nVidia users were also experiencing the problems too, albeit not as much but most of these were using a version of Vista or Windows 7<br />
<br />
This got me thinking and after scouring the forum, I noticed that there were very few issues with Windows XP and older ATi cards pre HD3870. I also noticed XBox 360 owners don't appear to have the problems either.<br />
<br />
So what is the common link? It appears to be Direct X. Xbox 360, Windows XP and older graphics cards are all using DirectX 9 NOT DX10 (Vista) or DX11 (Win 7).<br />
<br />
Anyway turns out that the problem lies in the DirectX implementation! If you run the game in DX10 modein Vista or Win 7 that's when the problems occur. Instead what you need to do is run the game in DX9 mode. This isn't something obvious in the game it needs
 to be done via a switch in the desktop icon.<br />
<br />
To do this follow the following steps:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Right Click on the Dragon Age Origins shortcut on your desktop (or quick launch, menu item etc)<br />
2. Choose Properties from the pop up menu.<br />
3. Click on the shortcut tab in the properties dialogue.<br />
4. Where the box Target: is move to the end of the line after the quote marks and put -dx9<br />
5. The target should then read (if you installed to the default directory, other wise it will be the path to your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; installed directory:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32Bit Windows 7/Vista -&nbsp; "C:\Program Files\Dragon Age\DAOriginsLauncher.exe" -dx9<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64Bit Windows7/Vista - "C:\Program Files (x86)\Dragon Age\DAOriginsLauncher.exe" -dx9<br />
6. Click OK. Job done.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi There,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No Probs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think your shortcut is pointing to the wrong target. Where is the path you installed it to originally. Also the desktop shortcut should be pointing to the DAOriginsLauncher.exe not the actual daorigins.exe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Try changing these parameters:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Target:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files\Dragon Age\DAOriginsLauncher.exe" -dx9<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Start in:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files\Dragon Age"<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, there should be a double backslash (\) only after the C: bit all the rest should be single backslashes. For some reason the forum doubles up - don't know why!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, been playing for hours now with absolutely no problems, so hopefully this workround will help you too. Good Luck<br />

            <p>Hi Glenjj.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you don't mind but could we just go back to the basics for a minute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You state this problem originally started after an update of the graphics drivers.&nbsp; Have you tried/got access to a different graphics card.&nbsp; This will eliminate the possibility of the card being the cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also can you try resetting your BIOS to the fail-safe setting.&nbsp; I have sometimes found this can address some issues.&nbsp; Don't know why but it can work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I take it you have a clean system.&nbsp; Have you tried a second/third AV program as a one off scan.&nbsp; Whilst most of the AV are very good sometimes one can miss something another finds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error you have with DirectX is one I have encountered before.&nbsp; I found the cause to be an offending usb device.&nbsp; Can you try accessing DxDiag with no usb devices.&nbsp; if you have a ps2 keyboard/mouse use them. If not, obviously, keep the usb keyboard and
 mouse&nbsp;plugged in and see if it will start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MY apologies if you have already done these.</p>

Sadly this is a rental PC so there's only so much I can mess around with, but the contract ends in a few months so then I can do whatever with it.
<div><br />
<div>So no I can't try a different card to eliminate that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nope haven't done anything with the BIOS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hmmm odd that a USB device would mess with the DirectX graphics, how did that affect yours?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yup I've tried a few programs to scan, apparently it's all clean.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And it's an odd issue, like for world of goo, windowed has no issue, fullscreen in its default resolution (800x600) it gets that glitch, but then if I alter the resolution in the config file and make it fullscreen then it works fine... confusing</div>

            <p>Hi Glenjj.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mentioned trying a different card because I had unresolved issues with a GT220.&nbsp; On my machine it would not work right but on others it would.&nbsp; Graphics display problems were the main thing.&nbsp; Research into this showed the problem affected all OS's with
 different hardware configurations and has been around for a good ten years.&nbsp; No set pattern to pin the problem on.&nbsp; I, however, am not saying this is your problem, just saying a different graphics card was the only answer for my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate that you have not done anything to the BIOS but resetting it to the fail-safe settings is still something you can try.&nbsp; I was working on a machine that had issues with something, can't remember exactly what, but after some messing around I just
 thought I would try the reset and it worked.&nbsp; I think that sometimes the BIOS gets affected through general use.&nbsp; I have used this several times to good effect and think it is always worth trying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USB thing I again could not get to the bottom of.&nbsp; I had spent several days in conversation with various tech supports and could not find an answer.&nbsp; Luckily I only needed to use the offending USB device&nbsp;twice a week so just plugged it in when needed.&nbsp;
 The main problem was that certain games would not launch due to the conflict with DirectX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live requirement for online play needs to end - Microsoft does - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfplopesusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live requirement for online play needs to end - Microsoft does not offer an online infrastructure</h2>
                    

<p>So, as &nbsp;many probably know, EA Origin services were unavailable for almost 48 hours recently.</p>
<p>So most people were unable to play any of EA games online.</p>
<p>But this is just one example. Over the time I've had problems with the party system not working properly.
<br />
Xbox online services unavailability and other issues while playing online games.</p>
<p>Now I fully understand that disruption on online services can occur. But Xbox Live GOLD is a PAY SERVICE.<br />
And according to Microsoft, &nbsp;multiplayer is only available to Xbox Live Gold members, because they need to pay for all the servers support the Xbox live service.</p>
<p>I really would like Microsoft to explain us what we are actually paying for. What is preventing Microsoft from allowing us to play online games FOR FREE?</p>
<p>One think I constantly notice, &nbsp;is that most of the services we use to play online, are provided by third-party companies.<br />
The party chat is peer to peer. One of the users hosts the chat and others join the server.<br />
Most online games use the same system and when they don't. the game is hosted on dedicated servers from EA, Ubisoft or any other company<br />
That same third party infrastructure is used on the PC, and provided free of charge.<br />
MMOs are running on non Microsoft servers, and so on.</p>
<p>Now I would understand if Microsoft charged us money for online play, if the reason behind that, was so that they could provide us a 99.9% uptime online service.<br />
But we are not getting that. &nbsp;We aren't even paying the guys that are hosting our online gaming sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So explain to me. Why do console gamers &nbsp;need to pay a subscription to play online?</p>

<p>Just so you know ea chooses to use their own servers. Titanfall and other games use Microsoft servers its up to the devs. &nbsp;Sorry its not gonna be free 60(got mine for39) for a year servicer isn't much. I'm happy to pay for the quality service that is gold.

<p>I've been paying for gold for 7 years, money well spent!</p>
<p>Can someone tell me where this argument has come from all of a sudden? Like others have said mate, if you want it free you online gaming is going to go south, fast.</p>
<p>Also, downtime, maintenance and issues are part of life, learn some patience. In Australia I pay $80 per year for my XBL Gold and this is a true bargain when you look at the doors it opens up for me.

<h2>            Cannot play The Witcher 2 on my Xbox One despite playing it on 360 just fine.</h2>
                    
<p>As above, I cannot play Witcher 2 on my xbox one via backwards compatibility Despite having it downloaded and having data on the cloud from my 360 and being able to play it on my 360. Now I know the seemingly obvious answer is to play it on my 360, however,
 I live at two separate addresses. One with my Xbox One and one with my 360. I was really getting into the game after playing Witcher 3 NG+ and reading the books but I keep getting the error "The storage device containing your gamer profile has been removed.
 You must reinsert the device in order to continue playing." when I boot it up on my Xbox One.</p>
<p>I have never had this error before. Has anyone else had this is issue? Can anyone help me? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there Scumbag Jordan!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issue! If you haven't already, I suggest trying a few troubleshooting steps:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>First,&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/remove-profile-from-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove your account from your Xbox One console</a>.</li>
<li>From the Home screen, scroll to the left and select Settings.</li>
<li>Select All Settings and then select System.</li>
<li>Select Storage and then select Clear local Xbox 360 storage.</li>
<li>Select yes and after your console has restarted,&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/download-your-xbox-live-profile-to-another-xbox-one-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download your account to your Xbox One console</a>.</li>
<li>Try launching the game to see if the issue continues to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give the suggested steps a try and be sure to let us know the results. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I did check AOMEI (not AEMEI) FAQS and webpage and there is nothing helpful there. &nbsp;And this is obviously a Windows issue because it is Windows 7 programs which fail to open these files.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Movie Maker will not play mp4 videos. Just a black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameswyclef  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Movie Maker will not play mp4 videos. Just a black screen with audio.</h2>
                    <p>I tried using Movie Maker after Windows 10 downloaded. I had a mp4 video from my phone (Samsung Galaxy Core Prime) I was trying to edit into a movie.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video is nothing but a black screen with only audio. I tried converting it to a wmv file and I get the error message- "Error: 0xC946002C THE FILE MAY BE CORRUPTED OR A FORMAT MOVIE MAKER MAY NOT RECOGNIZE"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then try to play the converted file in Windows Movie Player it says- "The player cannot play the video because it might be in a format the player doesn't recognize or might not support the codec that was used to suppress the file"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I play the original file in Windows Movie Player and it plays fine, but, still is just a black screen with audio in Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice is welcome.</p>

            <p>Check your cables and make sure they are connected properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are go to cortana and type in "Computer" right click on the image that will appear at the top and click on "Manage" it may require you to enter your administrative password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on the window that pops up there should be a "Disk Management" tab on the left bar. Click on it and ensure that both of your Drives are being detected by the OS. (Indicated by being blue and assigned a drive letter)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its not listed go to the right side of the window there should be an "Actions" tab With "Disk Management" below it and "More Actions" listed in a subset below that. Click on "More Actions" than "Rescan Disks" if that doesnt show anything try clicking
 "Refresh"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If neither of these work or its Black and without a drive leter im afraid that (as far as im aware) youll have to reformat the drive, youll lose the data stored on it if you do this though. Perhaps a moderator can find a way around this though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO make sure your external drive is unplugged.</p>

    <title>Sign-in PIN puzzle - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sign-in PIN puzzle</h2>
                    <p>I have just bought a new PC with Windows 10 installed.&nbsp; Though for a hardware issue the PC had to go back to the manufacturer for fixing.&nbsp; Before the return to manufacturer I had established a pin for signing in and it worked beautifully.&nbsp; When the PC was
 returned however, I could type the pin but it was not visible and so I had to default to using the MS Account password.&nbsp; I have found how to change my pin creating a new one but that doesn't work either.&nbsp; I have followed two or three forum advices on how to
 solve this problem but I must be doing something wrong as I still cannot enter even a new pin created through the "I have forgotten my pin" route.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do mean by "not visible" from your description?</p>
<p>What does it mean "found how to change my pin creating a new one"? Is it creating new account or creating another PIN?</p>
<p>Make and model of your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me confirm that the&nbsp;PIN password will be four numeric and it wont be visible. Once you have done entering four numeric&nbsp;password, you no need to press enter key. Instead it will automatically loads, authenticate&nbsp;and take you to desktop on entering last
 numeric.&nbsp;Suggest you to try using On-screen keyboard and see if you're able to sign-in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>* Press

<p><span>* Then use you cursor to type the password with

    <title>Bluetooth keyboard does not reconnect after sleep mode or computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christosf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth keyboard does not reconnect after sleep mode or computer restart.</h2>
                    When computer wakes from sleep, the bluetooth keyboard does not re-connect automatically. This occurs also during computer restart, or keyboard restart (if i power off and on the keyboard while it is connected).<br />
<br />
After checking some logs in Event Viewer, i came across this error (Event ID: 19, Source: BTHUSB):<br />
"Windows detected an error while storing the Bluetooth link key for adapter address (00:1f:20:3e:e7:42) on the local adapter. The event contains the vendor-specific error code."<br />
This error appears every time i connect the keyboard. It looks like for some reason the pairing key is not saved so when the session ends, the connection is lost.<br />
<br />
I also get this Warning (Event ID:2, Source: HidBth):<br />
"Bluetooth HID device (00:1f:20:3e:e7:42) either went out of range or became unresponsive."<br />
This appears when the keyboard is either powered off or the computer goes to sleep mode.<br />
<br />
I have tried updating the bluetooth drivers but that did't seem to fix it. I have tried using both the computers built in bluetooth dongle and Logitech's adapter for the keyboard but both lose connection in the same way.
<br />
I'm on my wit's end on trying to fix the problem. Logitech claims that the source of the problem is corrupted OS, however, i have run windows update and tested for new drivers.<br />
<br />
The operating system is Windows 7 Ultimate x64 and the keyboard is Logitech diNovo Edge.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
1. Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?<br />
2. What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
This issue may occur if the Basic Input or output System (BIOS) system that is installed on the computer reduces power to the port to which the input device is connected.
<br />
You may follow the suggestions and check.<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong><br />

            Thank you for your answer.<br />
<br />
I have not made any significant changes to the computer before installing the keyboard. However, as a last attempt to fix the issue i formated the drive and reinstalled Windows 7, then updated through windows update. I also performed a System File Check through
 command promt (sfc.exe) to repair any corrupted files since Logitech could not open some of the logs. After the format and check, the issue remains.<br />
<br />
After sending the new logs (MSINFO32, DxDiag, Application Event Log, System Event Log, setupap.app, setupapi.dev), Logitech found the following errors in MSINFO32 log file:<br />

The computer is built on a Shuttle barebone and the model name is SG33G6 Deluxe.<br />
BIOS version is the latest according to the site. The Bluetooth dongle is built into the computer, which is the reason i'm not suspecting power supply issues.<br />
<br />
I have tried updating the bluetooth drivers but they are already up to date according to windows upate. The latest Bluetooth drivers from Broadcom fail to install (specifically the "Bluetooth Software Download" stops working during the "Validate Bluetooth Device"
 step of the installation). I recall having the same issue in the past -with a different keyboard, but my previous bluetooth devices were working fine, so i did not have to look into it.<br />

    <title>dwm.exe memory leak leading to it crashing when on multiple monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drkhunter  say:</h3>
<h2>            dwm.exe memory leak leading to it crashing when on multiple monitors</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have three monitors, all attached to pcie and not onboard.&nbsp; When using Windows Aero with this setup dwm.exe climbs rapidly from around 30,000K memory usage to over 500,000K around which point it crashes taking Aero with it.&nbsp; Removing the other monitors resolves
 the issue, however I need these for my job.<br />
<br />
All drivers for mobo and gc's are up-to-date.&nbsp; The bios is the newest that the manufacturer has available (pre-installed).<br />
<br />
Obviously turning Aero off fixes the issue, but that's not the point.<br />
<br />
System details:<br />
Windows 7 Pro 64bit, SP1<br />
Intel Core i3-2100<br />
4GB RAM<br />
2 x ATI Radeon HD 5450<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
Richie<br />

            Have a similar problem with a very similar setup. <br />
<br />
3x 1280x1024 monitors<br />
2x Sapphire Radeon 6870's<br />
Phenom x II 965 BE @ 3.7<br />
16GB Kingston Hyper X PC 1600*<br />
Windows Ultimate 64x (updated)<br />
<br />
I just put the new memory in three weeks ago which was and upgrade from a single 4GB stick. Prior to that I would experience the same memory spike that you detail. After the upgrade I am seeing the same spikes but with 16Gb of ram it doesn't cause the crash.
 Obviously this isn't a straight fix but rather a workaround. dwe.exe is an obtuse piece of code and clearly has some memory management issues and unless and update is released to fix those (doubtful)&nbsp; putting some more ram in would be the cheap way to stabilize
 your system. ( much cheaper than replacing two graphics adapters which have nothing to doe with this problem)<br />

</p><p>&nbsp;I have 2 computers that are brand new builds doing this and the common factor are the dual monitors and onboard graphics. I have already uninstalled and deleted the video driver from device manager and reinstalled the latest driver. This improved things
 a little for both users but did not fix the issue. I contemplated using a video card but from the research I have done online I see plenty of people having this issue no matter what there build is.</p>

<h2>            MTE Test Disc</h2>
                    
<p>So, I discovered an "MTE Test Disc" in my Xbox One.&nbsp; As I understand it these are used to stress test systems.&nbsp; I am not certain that I like the idea of having a stressed system.&nbsp; At this point I am not sure what to do.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Problema connessione wireless&#47;lan</h2>
                    <p>Ciao a tutti, **** un problema nel connettere la mia one ad Internet... (premetto che **** un modem dlink 2740b, ed **** la possibilit√† di conettere sia tramite wifi che cavo). Al primo avvio, in cui chiede subito di connettersi ad internet, sono riuscito a connettermi immediatamente al mio wifi, e fin qui tutto bene. Ieri, sciaguratamente, **** voluto provare a connetterla attraverso il cavo ethernet, ed **** quindi scollegato la rete wireless dalle impostazioni xbox one... non l'avessi mai fatto: provando con il cavo, mi dice che non riesce a collegarsi ai server dhcp (eppure sono attivati, **** guardato sull'ip del modem). **** provato a spegnere e riaccendere il modem pi√π volte, ma niente. Oltre il danno anche la beffa: provando a collegarmi col wifi, inserisco la password corretta e mi dice che o il nome della rete o la password non sono corretti, eppure sono sicuro che √© tutto giusto. La cosa strana √© che con il modem spento, l'xbox rileva lo stesso la mia connessione wireless

            <p>Hey!&nbsp;Penso ci sia un problema di conflitto di IP. Fammi un favore. Al tuo router come accedi?&nbsp;con 192.168.1.1 o 192.168.0.1?<br /><br />In questo caso prova questa configurazione manuale sulla rete col cavo:<br /><br />IP:&nbsp;192.168.x.80&nbsp;&nbsp;(x = 0 o 1)<br />subnet: 255.255.255.0<br />Gateway:&nbsp;192.168.x.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;(x = 0 o 1)<br /><br />DNS&nbsp;8.8.8.8<br />DNS2: 8.8.4.4<br /><br />Quando ti connetti al wi-fi utilizza invece come IP 192.168.x.90&nbsp;&nbsp;(x = 0 o 1)<br /><br />Magari settando tutto manualmente si sblocca!&nbsp;:)<br /><br />Consiglio infine di riavviare la one staccando ANCHE&nbsp;la spina per 30 secondi&nbsp;:D</p>

<h2>            Skype eating up messages from my end of convo and other persons side.</h2>
                    <p>I updated my desktop skype to the latest version a couple of weeks ago and have since had problems where I will be in the middle of chatting to someone and suddenly I won't be getting messages from. When I've chat to them later once skype fixes itself they'll
 say that they were getting my msgs and were replying back but i wasn't getting theirs. They've sent me screenshots. Now I've also realised it's been happening from their end too where some of my msgs are not going through. I'll suddenly notice that their status
 goes offline but they will still be there typing to me...and when I reply back they're not getting it.
</p>
<p>I've logged out and logged back in when it happens...doesn't fix it. It seems to just come and go. We could be chatting without a problem for an hour and then Skype just stops working on one end and eats up the messages.</p>
<p>I've clicked on the Skype heartbeat status each time to see if it's showing any problems and each time it says all normal.
</p>
<p>I even reverted back to the older version of skype I prefer and it's done it on there as well.</p>

<p>As I already mentioned above I had updated to the latest version. Which started the problem.</p>
<p>So that was Version 8.25.0.5. </p>
<p>When the problems were persistent I reverted back to Classic Skype 7.41.</p>
<p>The problem has still persisted.</p>
<p>My Internet connection is ADSL.</p>
<p>I rarely use Skype for Web but when I had the problem I would even try that to see if it worked. Problem was there too.</p>
<p>This problem has happened with 2 contacts.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did a completely clean install where I took skype off my computer, I took off the web plugin and installed things fresh.</p>
<p>Conversation was good for an hour or so and then again randomly just stopped for 5 minutes before coming back and it's not just lag where there's a delay and message comes through. The messages just literally get eaten up.</p>

<p>Also I know it's not a problem with my internet connection because when the problem has started I can login to a different skype account and my messages will go through, it will just be messing up on my other.
</p>
<p>However I know it's not just one specific account because i started using the alternative account since it didn't seem to have the issue initially but then it started having the same problem.</p>

<h2>            Watch out...xbox one controller bug allows purchases without passkey</h2>
                    
<p>My 10 year old twins hacked the controller by mistake and ran up $200 of in app purchases. &nbsp;Microsoft Xbox One has a passkey that is supposed to be a security setting for protection from unwanted in app purchases. &nbsp;The problem is a child can bypass the secret
 6 digit passkey by simply hitting the controllers back eft and back right keys rapidly! &nbsp;The bug allows them to bypass the passkey protection and takes them right to the password screen. The kids know the password in order to use the Xbox One system. &nbsp;Since
 the passkey is easily hacked, the password entry is easily used as the final step to complete purchases of games, streaming content you name it. &nbsp;Microsoft has clearly had bad development and bad QA testing but it gets worse. &nbsp;Microsoft promotes a game called
 Garden Warfare that kids love and it preys on children with in app purchases. &nbsp;Microsoft splits the revenue that it steals from children and their parents. &nbsp;Its the only game I've see like this. &nbsp;First you purchase the game for $40. Then you can only play
 the game at home alone by joining Xbox Live from microsoft for $60. &nbsp;After all that your not done, they pick you pocket for in app purchases that are required to do anything with the game. &nbsp;Buyer beware...if I had know about this shameful situation, I would
 have purchased a different gaming device. &nbsp;Shame on you Microsoft. &nbsp;Fix you controller and kick Garden Warfare off your system! &nbsp;</p>



<p>use the password to use the system to game but By bypassing the passkeyThis bug means your child can get around your secret 6 digit passkey. &nbsp;If the controller didn't have this terrible bug, the 6 digit code you set up with keys on the controller &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;I have passed your thread on so the glitch can get looked into.</p>
<p>In the meantime I would recommend changing the password for your gamertag and creating separate ones for your children. &nbsp;Not only will you be able to control whether or not they can purchase items but any content you purchase on your account can be shared by them, included your Gold membership when they are added to your family from the Settings page.</p>

            <p>Hi Lynn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have found many users complaining about the ad hoc networks not being shown in the wireless network list in Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a work around, I would suggest you to use the Wireless hosted network and check if that helps you connect both the computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- In the Search Charms, type command prompt, right click on command prompt and select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>- Type the following&nbsp;commands and press enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><strong>netsh wlan show drivers</strong></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Check the "Hosted network supported" string. If it is yes, then your wireless network adapter supports hosted network feature. If not, then you will not be able to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the string is yes, then follow these steps and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To setup a hosted network,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><strong>netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=‚ÄùDESIRED_NETWORK_NAME‚Äù key=‚ÄùYOUR_PASSWORD‚Äù</strong></pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>To Start the Hosted network,</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><pre><strong>netsh.exe wlan start hostednetwork</strong></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>When you are finished with it, you can stop the connection using this command:</pre><pre><pre><strong>netsh.exe wlan stop hostednetwork</strong></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>You can get detailed information about the network you started with this command:</pre><pre><pre><strong>netsh wlan show hostednetwork</strong></pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>You may even download third party software  to connect two computers wirelessly.</pre><pre><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>Hope this information is helpful. If you have any concerns, let us know.</pre></pre></pre></pre>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgraded your PC to Windows 10. you have this option to revert back to the last version of Windows. To check if the
<strong>Go back to Windows 7 option </strong>is available, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; Security.</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Recovery</strong>, you should see <strong>Go back to Windows 7 option
</strong>and click <strong>Get Started</strong>.</li><li>Then follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the <strong>Go back to Windows 7 option </strong>is no longer available, our option is to downgrade to Windows 7 by performing a clean installation. If you upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, this means that computer came with a product key
 that allows you to use Windows 7. You may install it using the Windows 7 Media Creation Tool. For further instructions, you may check this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create installation media for Windows
</a></strong>and choose Windows 7. Another page will open that will ask you to enter the product key and you may follow the on-screen instructions.

<h2>            External monitor and laptop screen start blinking on and off.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenova Yoga 900 laptop (running Win10 Home 64-bit)&nbsp;that&nbsp;I attached a LG ultrawide monitor to. For the first month everything was golden; then the gremlins showed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Randomly both sreens will start blinking on and off, on and off, etc. sometimes for a few seconds, sometimes for a couple of minutes. I took it all back to Bestbuy twice (all of it, monitor, cable, laptop, adapters; all of it).&nbsp;&nbsp;After several purchases of
 different HDMI cables and adapters, I was told that the Intell(R) HD Graphics 520 display adapter wouldn't handle a second monitor. Bestbuy updated all the drivers last Friday; again. But the screens still blink on and off, on and off, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone... HELP. What can I do?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This concern on Windows 10 is usually caused by an incompatible app or an outdated display driver. Power interruption, or unstable powers supply can also cause the said concern. To determine the root cause you can refer to this article about:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12374/windows-10-troubleshoot-screen-flickering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot screen flickering in Windows 10.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you will receive information on that link about 3rd party software's causing the concern. It would be best if you check their respective forums for any known issue. Don't forget to take a look at your manufacturer's page as well to check for
 any known cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you have any other concerns, don't hesitate to come back to us.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8&#47;8.1 Issues Event ID 455</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I don't even know what this is. Over the past weeks I have noticed&nbsp;&nbsp;some strange behavior from Windows.&nbsp; One of the most apparent is the add/remove programs menu has no options to change how it is viewed. ie installed date, publisher name, version ect.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;What does that have to do&nbsp;with this error? nothing&nbsp;I assume.&nbsp; Never the less I think it's time for a full reinstall.&nbsp; System Restore has worked quite well for me , I am familiar with, but it can only do so much. Repair and recovery are not working but do
 they really ever from that menu.... Advanced start up fails over and over and that is with a back up and with a physical media Windows Disc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway I pasted the goods of the error below ,</p>

            Thanks, I looked around at read some of those before asking.&nbsp; I gave up on it ,the number of&nbsp;errors&nbsp;Windows Event logger&nbsp;is&nbsp;too&nbsp;great to count let alone obsess over as I did at one&nbsp;point.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even looking at the other users with the same Event ID 455&nbsp;there
 is too many variables with the endless hardware configurations.&nbsp; I just wanted to know what it&nbsp;was in plain&nbsp;English&nbsp;, say a for dummies version of this one&nbsp;error.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some errors and issues I know how to fix but really have no clue what they mean in the event
 log.&nbsp;None.&nbsp; It was worth a shot .&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Yes, I know. Some people ignore Event Viewer Errors because of it.</p>

            <p>I should apologize, I was waking and typing...&nbsp;coders and&nbsp;engineers &nbsp;for Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;have &nbsp;done as good as job as any cataloging the countless errors , on millions and millions of users.&nbsp; Props to that.&nbsp; Windows 8 Pro with my Desktop PC has been great, better
 than my other times with Windows.&nbsp; Though Vista sp2&nbsp;64 bit was amazing p. Seriously though it was good.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Like anything learning the entire windows kernel takes time, more if you don't have the source code available ...&nbsp; Got a long night a head of reading and referencing that Event Log....&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for replying to my nonsensical yammering.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will start using this more instead of staring quizzically at the screen.
