This&nbsp;works for some Programs, but not all.</span></p>
<p><span>This applies to Software Programs, NOT Hardware Drivers.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Update &#40;3 Sept. 2018&#41; killed my laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobclevenger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update &#40;3 Sept. 2018&#41; killed my laptop.</h2>
                    <p>Prior to 3 September 2018 my laptop computer (Panasonic CF-30K) was running Windows 10 just fine. Then Windows updated automatically and a message on the screen said something like "Schedule Restart or Restart now" so I selected the "Restart Now" option
 and my computer began the reboot process. After a short while I got an orange screen with a sideways sad face on it saying that something went wrong and that "we will reatart for you." At this point my computer began the reboot prrocess again. Things proceeded
 "normally" until the screen reverted to black with a Windows logo and circling dots. I left it to do its thing and I went off to do mine. When I returned some hours later I still had a black screen with the Windows logo but no circling dots. At this point
 I am beginning to get angry. I shut off power and then re-applied it. Same ****, different hour. I cycled power again and after beginning the boot process my computer informed me that it had failed to boot after several tries! Gee, thanks, Microsoft, I would
 have never figured that out on my own! Now I am presented with a menu of (very few) options: Try again -- DUH, what have I BEEN doing?; f8 for startup options; f9 for boot from another (non-existent) OS. I think that was all. The f8 option gives me a aomewhat
 larger menu. I have tried "Safe Mode"; "Safe Mode with networking; "Boot Logging; and I think one other. Not ONE of them successfully booted into anything at all.<br />
PLEASE do not suggest that I do anything that requires my computer to boot up as the whole problem is that it will NOT boot up. GOT THAT?</p>
<p>So how do I fix this? I do not have installation media since this Win 10 installation was via the Update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very unhappy and angry,</p>

            Hi Bob.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>1. I THOUGHT I had already mentioned that the computer in question is a Panasonic CF-30K LAPTOP.</p>
<p>2. Like most PANASONIC laptops, it was made by PANASONIC. HDD is a 1TB hybrid.</p>
<p>3. Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>4. If I could boot the damned computer I would be glad to get this information for you, but as I clearly pointed out in my first message --- THE DAMNED COMPUTER WILL NOT BOOT!<br />

<p>Hi Greg.</p>
<p>Thanks for the fast reply.</p>
<p>Can you give me a reply that is more tailored to my problem? I can not boot up my system, so any "solution" that references on-screen messages or prompts other than my original "Hey Dude, something's gone wrong" message or the messages on the attached photo,
 which is what I see after a couple of forced reboots, is not applicable.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38af2225-789c-4e2c-95f0-e3bead8d737d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38af2225-789c-4e2c-95f0-e3bead8d737d?upload=true" /></a></p>

            After pressing f8 I do not see a "start windows normally" option. The closest to that I see is "Press &lt;enter&gt; to return to your operating system." When I do that it just returns me back to the place where it hangs whenever I try to boot up.
<br />
Thanks for trying to help.

<p>My computer was trashed by a cumulative "update" on Sept. 1.</p>
<p>It would not boot up after installing the poison from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to fix it was to use the option to boot to another OS.</p>
<p>My other OS was the boot time Macrium Reflect recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once there, I restored with a Macrium system image made 2 days before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled Windows Update as soon as it got booted up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want any more "updates".🤢🤢🤢</p>

<p>I apologise for being short of patience with you.<br />
I needed to buy some DVD-R discs so I can burn the iso file. My laptop will not boot from a USB drive -- the BIOS does not support that. I bought the discs today, but then attended to prior commitments. I am probably too tired right now to reliably follow instructions.
 Back at it tomorrow. I shall keep you informed. </p>

    <title>Windows File explorer Drag &#38; Drop Hangs when passing over mapped - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreaorchesi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows File explorer Drag &#38; Drop Hangs when passing over mapped drives icons</h2>
                    Every time a file has to be dragged (dragged over an app to open them, dragged to copy them, etc.) and the icon of the files that are being dragged just grazes mapped drive's icon on the left side of any Explorer window the system hangs while waiting for
 the drive to come up. There HAS to be a solution, this question has been asked multiple times with no real answer. We either need the mapped drive to be polled only if we drop the files there or if the mouse hovers for a second or more. I'm resorting to drag
 avoiding mapped drives like in a frustrating game of Operation and it stopped being amusing the first day it did this. Please can you provide a solution? Thank you.

<p>Hi Andrea,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few possible reasons why you could experience hangs on your network drive, like traffic within the network or limitations set to it. Having said that, there might be a configuration that needs to be applied to get the optimum performance of your
 network drive. For us to refer you to the correct <strong>TechNet channel</strong> or for us to provide you the correct resolution, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your computer managed by a <strong>Windows Server</strong>? If so, what version of
<strong>Windows Server</strong> are you using?</li><li>Is your computer connected to a domain?</li><li>Is this happening on other computers when accessing the mapped drives?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>

            I'm on Windows 10 Pro. I'm not connected to a domain. I'm the only one using Windows 10 in my network. I can add that I noticed this does not happen all the time (it's probable that this happens after n minutes after I browse the network last) and I'm
 not 100% (I'll check again and get back to you) but this might be true for local disks that go in sleep mode. In short, it's as if Windows is checking the status of any drive too quickly, instead of waiting to see if the dragging operation is a flyover or
 not.

<p>Mapping drives&nbsp;on your Windows 10 have few pre-requisites upon setting it up. For added clarification, you can refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2616712/how-to-configure-and-to-troubleshoot-mapped-network-drives-that-connec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>procedure
 on mapping network drives</strong></a>. Because otherwise, you will still be able to share files from one computer to the other by using a&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>HomeGroup/WorkGroup</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in case, you can perform the troubleshooting indicated on the first link under the section&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot mapped network drive error messages</strong>,&nbsp;as this applies to troubleshooting network drives.

<h3> joeparkwy  say:</h3>
<h2>            ATTEMPTED_SWITCH_FROM_DPC blue screen &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At around 11:00 this morning, I got the message that my copy of Windows 10 was available. I upgraded and everything worked fine up until around 6:45ish this evening, at which point my PC blue screened with the error code "ATTEMPTED_SWITCH_FROM_DPC." What
 I'm wondering is what the heck this error means, how serious it is, and what caused it.<br />
</p>
<p>If this is a duplicate question I apologize; I only saw questions regarding this error in earlier versions of Windows. Hardware seemed the best available category to post this in, but please let me know if there's a better one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to&nbsp;let me know if there's any additional information you need (log files, what I was doing at the time, weird behavior prior to the crash, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

<h2>            Friend List shows up empty</h2>
                    
<p>On both my xbox one and xbox 360 I haven't been able to view my friend list for the past 6 hours (approximately). My xbox 360 friend list doesn't even show up and every time I choose my friend list from my xbox one it tells me that my friends can't be shown
 at this time, even though on the home page it shows how many friends I have online. I also cannot load my account on this website, every time I choose 'My Account' in top right corner I'm shown a "oops, you've found a glitch" page.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having similar problems or have a solution to fix it? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Mostly programs using WiFi but&nbsp;WiFi still working and no internet issues.&nbsp;Checked MS Mail this morning. Looking through emails - program just quits returns me to desktop. Also Internet Explorer based websites.&nbsp;Suspect it&nbsp;may be related to any website with
 video or complex graphics. Watching a news or other video then entire Internet Explorer quits and I'm back to the&nbsp;desktop.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Startup-Repair doesn&#39;t work &#40;after &#34;Blazing Angels&#34; game installation killed system&#41;</h2>
                    I installed the game "Blazing Angels - Squadrons of WWII" (designed to run on Windows XP) and after the required system restart
<b>Windows won't start</b> - it shows the startup screen just for a second, then it loads the startup-repair tools, but the
<b>automatic system repair doesn't work</b> and <b>reseting the system to a autosave prior to the crash doesn't work either</b>.

<div>The startup-repair shows the following:</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few things you may try which might help you boot the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Last known good configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps from the link to boot the computer using Last Known Good Configuration.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/using-last-known-good-configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/using-last-known-good-configuration</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try to get into Safe mode and check if you are able to boot to desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this does not help, then use the Windows 7 installation disc to get into System recovery options and then try Startup repair and system restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. System Recovery options using the Windows installation disc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/what-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/what-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-windows-7</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the start up repair fails to load the computer, then perform System restore.</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><b>Note: </b>Application /programs that were installed after the last restore point will be lost. You may have to reinstall the application/programs.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Let us know if this helps or if you have any concerns.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error 80150101</h2>
                    
<p>While trying to download DLC for Mass Effect 3 (Retaliation Pack) I keep receiving the following error: &nbsp;80150101</p>
<p>When I come on here to look up this error code, it tells me it is an unknown error code. &nbsp;Can anyone help clarify what may be happening? &nbsp;Others are able to download the DLC but I repeatedly get this error code.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I am getting the exact same code when trying to download a pre order bonus for Dishonored from Best Buy. It comes up as if Live understands what the content is but when I go to hit download I get this error. Which of course Xbox.com does not recognize.
</p>
<p>VERY annoying.. Glad I am not the only one and seems to be not just the content I was going after.</p>

            That model HP use the inbuilt win7 drivers, are you saying with the parallel adapter the printer is not even detected? If so and your PC is a desktop try a pci/parallel card

<p>Hey battelfront</p>
<p>The best way would be to fully power down your console by holding the power button on the console for then unplugging the power cord for 2-3 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then unplug your external hard drive and power back up.</p>

<p><span>Hello myfhn,</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you use Internet Explorer as the default browser and check if you have the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span>To set Internet Explorer as default browser, follow these methods:
</span></p>
<p><span>Click on Tools from the toolbar in Internet Explorer<span>&nbsp;
</span>and select Internet Options. Then select the Programs tab from the top of the window to access the default browser settings. You can even choose to be alerted if Internet Explorer is not your default browser. Click OK to save your changes.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can also refer the link that will give you information on how to set the set your default web browser:

Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />

I would recommend you do a clean boot with msconfig and see if there is a program or software that is conflicting and causing the slowness.<br />
<br />
KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>I would like to see if any startup items or third party services could be causing the issue.&nbsp; This is called a clean boot. You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us determine if this issue is caused
 by a loading program or service.</p>
<p><br />
The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application and or service running that is possibly interfering. To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to
 go back into “msconfig” and start to enable programs and services and reboot until we see which one causes the problem.</p>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.
<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p>Please reply back and let us know if you are still having problems.<br />

<p>Another way to speed up browsing in Internet Explorer is to disable add-on's&nbsp; that maybe be slowing down your browser, to do that:<br />
In IE, go to ‘tools’ and ‘manage add-ons’.<br />
Disabling any unnecessary add-ons may help your Internet run faster.<br />
Try disabling add-ons with more than a .2 sec load time. (i.e. tool bars)</p>

            Hi Marilyn,
<div><br />
<div>I followed your steps of booting up the computer in "clean boot" to no avail. &nbsp;I'm not only have this issue with IE, but also Chrome. &nbsp;What's interesting is that I used to be able to view the internet pages just fine, but lately it doesn't load the pages
 (they always seem to timeout). &nbsp;I tried clearing the Temporary Internet Files, but that that didn't fix the issue either. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

            Hello RobertNoble4, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest following the instructions down below.
<br />
<br />
<br />- Plug your dongle into your computer and make sure you have an internet connection.
<br />- Confirm that the Fitbit Connect application recognizes your dongle by right-clicking on the Fitbit Connect icon, which is located near the date and time on your computer. You should see "USB Dongle Connected."
<br />- If you see "USB Dongle Disconnected," please insert your dongle into a different USB port on your computer.
<br />- If you see "USB Dongle Connected," attempt to force sync your Flex from Fitbit Connect.
<br />- Try restarting your tracker using the instructions here <a href="https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1041329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/article...</a>
<br />
<br />- If you are still having trouble syncing your tracker, uninstall Fitbit Connect by doing the following:
<br />
<br />1. On a PC: Open Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Select Fitbit Connect &gt; Uninstall.
<br />On a Mac: search for Fitbit Connect in your Downloads folder. Open the file, then click the Uninstall Icon.
<br />2. Download the newest software version from here <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fitbit.com/setup</a> and follow the prompts.
<br />3. After reinstalling the software, please try to force sync.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.

            <p>Hi Andka.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about your concern, can you give us more info? When did this issue started? Do you have the same issue when using other applications? Have you tried to check for and install the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
updates</a>? What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get started, you can try two-button shutdown by doing the following steps:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 1:</strong></td>
<td>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 2:</strong></td>
<td>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.
<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 3:</strong></td>
<td>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 4:</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Erwin</p>

    <title>Trouble Activating Windows 10 on a Brand New Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindienaude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble Activating Windows 10 on a Brand New Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Would really appreciate if someone could help me out. Just bought a brand new Dell laptop, and was setting it up when I noticed a notification saying Windows 10 hasn't been activated yet. I went into settings to activate it but it gives me the error code
 0xC004C008, saying that the product key was already used on another device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating and then restarting my laptop but that hasn't fixed it. I am at a loss for what to do, because this is a brand new laptop so I don't know how the product key could've been used already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any insight on how to fix this, it would be greatly appreciated!<br />

            Hi Lindie
<br />
<br />A new PC should when it is put on the Internet automatically activate without any user interaction at all . . .
<br />
<br />In Settings - Update and Security - Activation, click the Activation Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this, and especially with the error you are seeing, you should return that laptop and get a replacement, this is not your fault, If Windows is initially installed correctly should activate without the need for you to do anything . . .

            Hi Lindie,
<br />Some laptops have preinstalled not Windows but Linux or FreeDOS. Such laptops are cheaper and unfare sellers may install illegal Windows to get additional money.
<br />Please ask Dell what system was preinstalled on this laptop.
<br />Or run a built-in command 
<br />wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey 
<br />(need to be run from Windows PowerShell (administrator) To see if there is a key for preinstalled Windows.

<h2>            media player cannot download media usage rights</h2>
                    media player used to work fine.&nbsp; as I try to play a file, the player looks like it tries to go out and get the media usage rights, but then displays a dialogue box indicating that it can't seem to do it.&nbsp; This is true for more than one store.&nbsp; It appears
 that the player is having trouble accessing the internet.

<p>Hi sweetsco,</p>
<p>Media Player cannot download media usage rights automatically if the Download usage rights automatically when I play or sync a file option is turned off (by default, it is turned on). To verify that it is turned on, do the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click the arrow below the <strong>Now Playing</strong> tab, click <strong>More Options</strong>, and then click the<strong> Privacy</strong> tab.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Verify that the<strong> Download usage rights automatically when I play or sync a file</strong> check box is selected.</p>
<p><strong>In addition</strong>, if you subscribe to a music or video subscription service through an online store, it is recommended that you turn on the Automatically check if protected files need to be refreshed option (by default, it is turned on). When
 this option is turned on, the Player will periodically scan your library for purchased and subscription files that are missing media usage rights, files that have expired rights, or files that have rights that are about to expire. The Player will then try
 to download the rights from the Internet. This helps improve the playback, burn, and sync experiences with purchased and subscription files. To verify that this option is turned on, do the following:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Click the arrow below the<strong> Now Playing</strong> tab, click <strong>More Options</strong>, and then click the
<strong>Privacy</strong> tab. <br />
2.&nbsp;Verify that the <strong>Automatically check if protected files need to be refreshed</strong> check box is selected.<br />
If your computer is missing all the media usage rights for files that you have obtained from an online store, the store might offer a way to restore them.</p>

<p>I would not post for an answer that can be easily found.<br />
<br />
As noted in my request, the player attempts to get the media<br />
usage rights, but the "can't seem to get it, maybe the internet<br />
is conjested" dialogue box comes up.<br />
<br />
This is a more 'advanced' problem.&nbsp; Please help.<br />

<p>Hi sweetsco,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;From which website are trying to play the songs?</p>
<p><br />
To see which stores are available in your <strong>country</strong> or <strong>region</strong>, select your location from the list, and then click
<strong>Go</strong>. Additional stores will be available in the coming months as stores migrate to Windows Media Player 11.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my own investigation into this problem, it would appear that the DRM authentication server is not responding because it has been shut down. &nbsp;I do not know why but I wanted to save others the annoyance of continuing to pursue this red herring. &nbsp;Sometimes
 the answer is "NO".</p>

    <title>outlook express shutting down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rikiyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook express shutting down</h2>
                    <p>I am operating on Windows 8, using Office 365. I am on mobile broadband which has 8g capacity and didn't have a problem using Outlook express until last week. It closes down whenever I'm working on emails to send. I don't have a problem opening emails to
 view. I get a message saying outlook has a problem and is not responding and is closing down, then another message comes up saying outlook is restarting. Any messages I'm working on at the time is lost as the message does not go to my draft folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me out please?</p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow these methods, provided below and check, if it helps.&nbsp;

The issue is occurring due to outdated or corrupt graphics card driver. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also update the graphic card driver from Device Manager manually and check if this helps:<br />
•Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.<br />
•Expand “Display Adaptor”.<br />
•Right click on the graphic card driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check, if it works.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue still persists, follow the Method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><br />
<strong>Install the latest Display adaptor driver and Graphic card driver in Compatibility mode:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to uninstall and download the latest the Display adaptor driver and Graphic card driver from manufacture's website and reinstall it in compatibility mode.<br />
