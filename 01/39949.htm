<h2>            Verify your identity on Windows 10</h2>
                    I have just had Windows 10 installed on my desk top computer.&nbsp; I try to verify my identity and a box appears showing an e mail address partly starred out and underneath asks me to type in my e mail address but the two e mail addresses do not match.&nbsp; Can
 I correct the starred out e mail address and if so how?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the questions below to assist you better.</p>
<p>- When you say "two e mail addresses do not match", what exactly are you referring to?</p>
<p>- How are you trying to verify your identity?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important from a security point of view that you <strong>verify your identity</strong> on your
<strong>Windows 10 PC</strong>. Verifying your identity helps you protect your data. If when accessing sensitive information from this device, if Microsoft suspects fraudulent activity, they will ask you to enter a security code which will be sent to your Microsoft
 Account email ID or your mobile phone number. If you use this device frequently to access important data, then verifying your identity once will help Microsoft that it is indeed you, who is using the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help us with more information to assist you further.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Guru Kiran</p>

Hi Remy,<br />
<br />
this seems to be the cause of the delay. Your PC tries to connect them all and this takes some time.<br />

                    I have been having a problem with my LG HBS-800 headset, at first i thought it was a problem with the sound bet then noticed there was a problem with the drivers, in the Device Manager it shows that HBS800 has a driver problem but has no updates. This
 error came out of no where and I very much like this headset, can anyone help me out?

            <p>It looks like this headset is bluetooth 3.0 ? Is bluetooth turned On in your computer settings ? &nbsp;Do you have the latest bluetooth drivers installed? If not you can download drivers from the link below for either Windows 10 &nbsp;32bit or 64 bit Windows (2nd
 and 3rd in the list) and see if that fixes the problem.</p>

<h2>            How to Change Background Color for Captions</h2>
                    Deaf Community need to read white letters on the black background as it reduces glare. I tried to change font color on the transparent background but it doesn't work well for me. Black background color on white letters works best for those Deaf vision-impaired.
 Black background with different color texts sounds more appealing. It is very important to ensure that we can read text easily. Add other feature for the background colors for the Deaf people to choose from, if that's possible?

            <p>Hi Vicki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you would like to use a feature for the background colors for Deaf people. Well, unlike prior versions of Movie Maker (e.g. WMM 6.0 and earlier), there isn't a way to set the background color of a caption, just of the background color of
 the full page when creating a title or credit slide. However, in the latest version of Movie Maker 2012&nbsp;there

    <title>So Many Bugs, So much Dissapointment. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spencer olson  say:</h3>
<h2>            So Many Bugs, So much Dissapointment.</h2>
                    
<p>So I got my Xbox One about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and this is what I have experienced so far; (BTW I have had good connection and an open NAT type through all of this.)</p>

<p>1) I turned on the auto-sign in, but it only works like half of the time.</p>

<p>2) The dashboard says "Having trouble connecting?" Even though I am connected to the internet, so I can't access any of the marketplace stuff</p>

<p>3) Xbox Parties. First of all, the "Party App" is ridiculous, why did you take away the pop-up dashboard from 360? However, back to the actual bug, just about every other time I join a part, after about 5-10min, no one can hear eachother. So we have either
 leave the party and start a new one, or just use game chat.</p>

<p>4) I recently got Destiny, and it took 3 tries to enter my code in. It would accept the code, but would fail downloading it. Not to mention it takes almost 10 minutes to load each step of the code process...</p>

<p>5) Every time I start up a game, the sound does not work. I have to either go to dashboard and back in, or if that doesnt work, do a hard reboot.</p>

<p>6) I have had my xbox for about 3 weeks, and the RB button is already broken. And no, I am not to harsh on my contoller. I have had my Xbox 360 controller for almost 3 years now, and it still works perfectly fine. The RB button goes in, but doesn't make
 that "click" and it doesnt register in games.</p>

<p>7) Mics are trash. Not to mention I can't use my $100 turtle beaches because you guys changed the plug. The volume does not get loud enough(On default mic) and sometimes the mic just wont pick up sound. Right when you go into game chat, you can see the other
 persons is logo moving, but you can not hear them.&nbsp;(All my friends had this problem, not just me)</p>

<p>8) If I have my mic plugged into my controller when I try to connect it to my xbox, it blinks very slowly and will not connect unless I unplug it.</p>

<p>9) This isnt really a bug, more of a disapointment... The whole get rid of the pop up dashboard was a giant mistake. To invite my friends to a party, I have to either launch a party app that takes up half of my screen, or go back to dashboard, click on party,
 and then invite everyone. The pop up was so fast and easy and it made sense, why would would throw away a perfectly good thing?</p>

<p>9) The first time I tried to start a game, it said "Game took to long to start, returning to dashboard". What good is an xbox if it can't even start up a game right?</p>

<p>10) Every time I hit "Friends" on the dashboard, it will say "We can't show your friends right now." I have to refresh it two or three times before it will show my list of friends. This also happens for the feed on the right. And on top of that, it takes
 2 or 3 minutes just to refresh it.</p>

<p>These problems are tedious, and making me regret buying an Xbox One. It is so much of a hassle that I would rather just not play it than go through all the trouble of trying to join a party, talk with friends, having no one hear eachother, constantly disconnecting
 from eachother, etc... I know that the Xbox One is a fairly new console, but still, these should have been fine, considering it was all ok on the Xbox 360. The Xbox One is a major downgrade from the 360, and I am extremely dissapointed Microsoft...&nbsp;</p>

<p>It helps to avoid duplication if you list the "number of things" that you tried.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try to add .NET Framework 3.5 as a Windows features. This is already an embedded feature for Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To turn features on or off
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span>Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span><span>Windows</span> features</span> in the search box, tap or click
<span>Settings</span>, and then tap or click <span>Turn
<span>Windows</span> features on or off</span>. <span>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.2%2fmain%2f1f9463c2-c968-47bf-9b4d-939c5d1af477_70.jpg" />&nbsp;You might be asked for
 an admin password or to confirm your choice.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>To turn a <span>Windows</span> feature on, select the check box next to the feature. To turn a
<span>Windows</span> feature off, clear the check box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>OK</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/turn-windows-features-on-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/turn-windows-features-on-off</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't work you can add .NET using DISM command in Powershell or Command Prompt. This works if you have the installation&nbsp;source like the Windows 8 disc or ESD setup files that was downloaded if this is an upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Press Windows Key+Q then type either PowerShell or CMD. Right click on the result then Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong><span>dism.exe </span>
<span>/</span><span>online
</span><span>/</span><span>enable</span><span>-</span><span>feature
</span><span>/</span><span>featurename:NetFX3
</span><span>/</span><span>Source:d:\sources\sxs
</span><span>/</span></strong><span><strong>LimitAccess</strong> then hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Source would depend where the ISO, setup files or the disc is located for the "sources\sxs" folder. Mine is a USB media installer where the location is "h:\sources\sxs".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>
<p><span>Mike</span></p>

<h2>            HDMI &#43; 5.1 ljud &#61; m&#38;&#35;246&#59;jligt&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hej.</p>
<p>Det är så att jag nyligen införskaffat en ny tv och har därför övergått till HDMI, hade tjock-tv med komponentkabel innan.</p>
<p>Problemet är bara att jag nu inte kan koppla in mitt 5.1 system någonstans. Innan var det ju bara att koppla in det i komponentkabeln men den går ju inte att ha samtidigt som HDMI kabeln. Jag har även&nbsp;kapat av plastbiten som sticker ut men båda kablarna
 får&nbsp;ändå inte plats.</p>
<p>Någon som har en lösning på problemet?</p>
<p>Har ett 360S, Logitech X540 plus en Panasonic tv, kan ta kort på utgångarna ifall det skulle behövas.</p>

<p>På "Slim" modellen ska det finnas ett separat 5.1 ljudutgång bredvid HDMI.porten. Du ska alltså inte koppla in ljudkabeln i nån annan kabel utan den ska direkt in i xboxen.

<p>Det är ingen ingång utan en utgång. </p>

<p>Den röda rutan visar vars 5.1 ljuder kommer ut. Ser det inte ut så hos dig?</p>

<p>Jag tror inte det är fullt så enkelt. Om jag har förstått det rätt så har Logitech X540 ingen 5.1 ingång vilket innebär som du säger att du lär konvertera ljuder från SPDIF till RCA, MEN jag tror även att du behöver en decoder för att få det att funka. Ljudet
 som matas ut via HDMI och komponent tror jag inte är 5.1 utan ska du ha riktig surround är det toslinken som gäller.
</p>
<p>Nu är inte jag nån expert på ljud så om nån annan har en bättre lösning så är det fritt fram.

<p>Ingen av mina xboxar har optisk utgång men jag kör på en special sladd istället.</p>

<p>Jo jag kör via en sån där jag också. Som jag förstått det vill trådskaparen splitta ljudet från den optiska (eller hdmi.t borde väl också funka) till hans surroundsystem. Problemet är att hans surroundsystem INTE har varken hdmi eller optical in vilket skapar
 problem. Hans ljudingångar är istället RCA. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I och för sig borde han ju kunna ta ljudet från den där adaptern via analoga ljudutgångarna (röd/vit) men då blir det ju stereo och inte 5.1.</p>

<p>Hm. Har varit på Kjell &amp; Company nu och fick tipset att gå till HIFI klubben och kolla på en slags omkodare från SPDIF till RCA men den kostade 1400:- och då blev det enbart stereo. För övrigt fanns det tydligen ingen lösning.</p>
<p>Jag skulle tro att adaptern på bilden ovan inte passa samtidigt som HDMI´n eftersom att komponentkabeln inte gör det heller.</p>

<p>Den där kontaken som Tabbe visar är en riktig tabbe, för som Palmbear säger så får inte den kontaken plats när man kör hdmi samtidigt, den där ljudkontakten är ju så idiotiskt tjock så den mer eller mindre täcker hdmi utgången på 360´n, riktigt kasst är
 det,</p>
<p>men jag tog och skar bort en bit av plasten på kontakten, kunde karva bort drygt 1 centimeter helt onödig plast på kontakten och sen kunde man köra både den och hdmi samtidigt,

<h2>            HDCP issues</h2>
                    
<p>So,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>whenever I start my Xbox from sleep, wake it up I guess, HDCP doesn't authenticate, and my receiver sends a signal, but it's encrypted so i just see a black screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I do a full restart the Xbox does authenticate HDCP and the LIVE TV works well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why doesn't it just reauthenticate HDCP after sleep? That seems stupid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else experiencing black TV after standby?</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue with my DirecTV HR24-500. To make matters worse, the HDMI plugs on the back of the XBox seem loose and finicky, so if I move anything that might be touching the wires, I have to reseat the cables and cold boot the XBox before I
 will get a TV signal again.</p>

<p>I removed the HDMI hub/switch, and I haven't seen the issue since. I never thought that it would interfere with device communication. My new setup is: TiVo Premiere -&gt; Xbox One -&gt; HDMI Hub -&gt; Samsung TV</p>
<p>It's probably better not to run any other devices through the Xbox anyway to avoid introducing unnecessary delay.</p>
<p>Thanks for the assist!</p>
<p>For reference, I'm using the following HDMI Hub:</p>
<p>Portta PET0301S 3x1 HDMI Switcher</p>

<p>Supanova9999, you are seeing that exact issue. Please post under the make/model of your Dish Network DVR. That would help a ton in tracking these devices so we can work with our partners to help resolve this issue:

<p>I have the same black screen HDCP signal (in fact sometimes I"ll see a blue screen from my cable box saying "your HD content has been compromised")</p>
<p>Here is my set up info:</p>
<p>I have an issue with both the Motorola DCX-700m and the DCX3200m, the issue is the same with both. &nbsp; I'll turn on the TV app I see a picture with no sound for about 3-5 seconds and then the picture goes to black (not the "You are not connected" screen).</p>
<p>I've done some troubleshooting and have determined that its my Denon AVR-391 audio reciever that is not playing nice. &nbsp; Once I plug my Xbox One hdmi out into my TV directly, the TV signal pass thru works perfectly.</p>
<p>Here is my system setup info when TV pass thru wasn't working:</p>
<p>Motorola DCX3200 STB hdmi in to</p>
<p>Xbox One hdmi out to</p>
<p>Denon AVR-391 out to</p>
<p>Panasonic TC-P50UT50 Television</p>
<p>When I hook it up like this, TV pass through works fine:</p>
<p>Motorola DCX3200 STB hdmi in to</p>
<p>Xbox One hdmi out to</p>
<p>Panasonic TC-P50UT50 Television</p>
<p>I really hope Microsoft comes up with a fix to this because I'm not buying a new reciever and I'm not gonna plug/unplug my xbox's hdmi cable directly into my TV every time I want to watch TV. &nbsp; For now I'll just not use the TV app, which obviously I am not
 happy about.</p>

<p>I was curious to see if I had a new CD key. Magical Jelly Bean shows that it is different from the old Windows 7 key. But is it a unique key for me or generic for everyone?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the reasons why your Dad is not seeing any video feed from the other Skype user:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The other Skype user doesn’t have a webcam.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The webcam that the other Skype user is using is turned off.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Weak Internet connection signal on other Skype user side or on both sides.
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The video feed automatically start once the call is connected. If you have Skype app installed on your device on your device, please try to make
 a test video call to your Dad’s Skype app and let me know of the results. </span>

            Whoever installed it, might have installed a volume license (organization key) on your computer.&nbsp;
<br />Windows 10 Pro volume license clients are used by large organizations that deploy Windows 10 in bulk to hundreds or thousands of computers. Sometimes, users will copy these organization keys off the Internet and use them to install Windows 10 Pro, but they are blocked from activating because it can't reach appropriate KMS host (Server computer) which handles the activation request.&nbsp;

<br />
<br />This is because the computer does not have a license. You need to buy a new key from Windows Store.
<br />Unfortunately, we cannot help in activation related issues as we are mostly volunteers here

            Hi Gilda, here is where to fins Windows 10 Tools:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Update:
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Update
<br />
<br />Internet Options:
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />Go to Network and Internet - WiFi
<br />
<br />Chrome Options:
<br />In Chrome, click the 3 dots at the top right and choose Settings
<br />
<br />Please Note: while you do not use Internet Explorer, some Internet settings in Windows 10 are still set in the Internet Explorer Options panel, until the Microsoft Engineers move them to the Settings App . . .

<h2>            Windows 7 ultimate key will not activate Windows 10</h2>
                    Have a Sony VAIO VGN-AW11M laptop. Upgraded satisfactorily from Vista to Windows 7 ultimate a while ago. &nbsp;The free update to Windows 10 appeared on the task bar but the update stalls during installing drivers. &nbsp;This has happened at least 6 times. &nbsp;Tried
 a clean install from DVD onto a blank Hard disk. &nbsp;The install completed but asks for a product key to activate. &nbsp;The Windows 7 key does not work. &nbsp;Has anyone got a solution to this dilemma please.

</p><p>Double check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About if it's Pro version and that you have Version 1511.&nbsp; If so you should be able to insert the WIndows 7 Product Key at the link there as long as the correct version was installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no Version 1511 then expedite Updates until it installs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If key still fails then the main reason is incorrect characters being inputted.&nbsp; What is the exact error message when you triple check each character and apply it?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you tried inserting the Windows 7 Product Key during install this may also have messed it up because this is only done afterwards per the Version 1511 FAQ at the end of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/activation-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Activation in Windows 10.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you installed Home version, or tried inserting any Product Key during install, try inserting now the default Windows 10 Pro Product Key VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T to change the version to Pro and/or reset the key to default.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then restart the PC and try inserting the Windows 7 Product Key again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this fails then right click Start button, open Admin Command Prompt, type slui 4, press Enter.&nbsp; Follow Prompts to activate via phone, if it fails stay on the line to speak with an agent to explain the situation.</p>
