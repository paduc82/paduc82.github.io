<h2>            Trying to run an old PC game on windows 10 becomes really slow&#58; how to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
I am trying to run "kaartspel van Catan" (Catan card game) in Windows 10 and the menu works okay, but when I enter the actual game, it works too, but is very slow. I have the impression it is displaying the individual frames at a lower rate, as things are moving,
 but very slowly and the game responds quite delayed to my mouse clicks as well (but I might be entirely wrong). It is playable in the sense that it works and displays the right things and responds to my clicks, eventually, but it is just super slow.</p>
<p>The game requires Windows 98,ME,2000, XP or VISTA, 32Mb RAM, 100Mb disc space, Pentium 233MHz processor, and a directX7.0 compatible grafics and audiocard.&nbsp;<br />
I think the problem might be with the DirectX compatibility (my laptop has DirectX12) or graphics card compatibility (again I might be entirely wrong)?</p>
<p>I already tried running the program in 98, XP and Vista compatibility modes, and running as administrator (also the combination of these two). I also tried to find a solution with the built in windows program to find compatibility issues, but no luck here.</p>
<p>I have an Asus x75V with windows 10 (upgraded from windows 8.1), intel core i5 processor, NVIDIA Geforce 610M - 1 GB graphic processor.&nbsp;<br />
I know the game worked well on one of my previous computers (windows XP).<br />
I wonder if there is a way to run this game on my windows 10 computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The box of the card game actually comes with 2 games: "kolonisten van catan incl zeevaarders" (Colonists of Catan) and the card game, both with the same system requirements. Running Colonists of Catan was problematic too, but in this case I found a workaround
 after some searching: run it using the NoVideoSound batch file to start it, instead of the default (I am not sure why this worked, but maybe this provides a clue on how to get the other game working too??). Unfortunately the card game does not have such a
 NoVideoSound batch file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With kind regards,<br />

            There really isn't much you can do with old 32 bit legacy programs on Windows 10.
<br />What you can try is to use virtual PC and create a windows xp virtual machine and install the program in there.
<br />See link.

<p>First.... Nothing to do with 32bit 'legacy' programs. The vast majority of PC games are 32bit, even many (most) recent ones.</p>
<p>The one 'legacy' issue the game would have has to do with Direct Play, which I assume you already have enabled as games</p>
<p>that need it don't generally load if it's not enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"..., </em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>eventually, but it is just super slow."</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The definition of unplayable.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I think the problem might be with the DirectX compatibility"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Win10 has DirectX9,10&amp;11 as well as a couple of mostly unused (only a few newer games use DX12) DX12 files.</p>
<p>Your game is DX7, but DX7&amp;8 will run on Win10. The fact that the game runs at all indicates the problem is not due to DX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Yes, your 610m is bottom of that series, but it should have no problem running a game with basic graphics such as this.
</p>
<p>What could hang it up is there are no dedicated Win10 drivers on the ASUS download page for your machine so the Nvidia 610
</p>
<p>may not be performing as well as it could on Win7/8.1 which ASUS does have drivers for (even though they are five years old).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win10 driver from Nvidia may or may not work well, but it's worth a try, if you have not already installed a driver from Nvidia.</p>
<p>The generic driver supplied by Windows Updates would be the least desirable last resort driver for your Nvidia 610.</p>
<p>(final release for this series - March 2018)&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>- It looks like the original game in the series was released in 2002. While most games from 2002 will run on Win10 some have their</p>
<p>own peculiarities, so you probably need to go back to dedicated Catlan sites to try and find fixes for your version of the game.</p>

<h2>            Realtek internal laptop microphone not working</h2>
                    <p>As a title says I have a problem with internal microphone. After my microphone on headset stopped working (hardware failure, I've tested it) I had no other option than switch to internal mic. However in sound options on windows 10 the internal mic seems
 deaf. I've tried troubleshooting and it found no problems. Automatic driver updater says I have the best drivers available. Any other way to try to fix it? Or is there a way to detect a hardware failure if internal mic?</p>
<p>

            Hi Filip,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Microphone 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your microphone' is turned on and make sure the appropriate app is also set to On
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in Settings, go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Recording Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter

<p>Thanks for reply, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>My problem is that even Windows can't detect any audio incoming (when I look to recording devices, there is zero green bars on while speaking). I've tried troubleshooter you had recommended, but it didn't identify any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if some of names for option menus I mention are wrong. I don't have Win 10 in English.</p>

            If someone has recently left you a message, you will see a notification in your recent conversations list.
<br />
<br />Click the contactâ€™s name in the Recent list, then in the conversation window, click the Play button next to the message.
<br />
<br />If you canâ€™t hear the message, try turning up the speaker volume on your computer.
<br />
<br />After you have listened to a voice message, it is stored locally on your computer. This means that you wonâ€™t be able to listen to it again if you sign in to Skype on a different device.

<p><span>Hi jibberz</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, multiple audio output is not a supported feature in Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You could however, check with the hardware manufacturer for possible programs to perform this function.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround you may try the steps listed in the below link and check:

            Hi Jim
<br />
<br />Since you cannot get into the Windows Recovery Environment, your only option is to go to a working PC and create bootable Windows Installation Media
<br />
<br />Then boot your PC from that Media and instead of installing Windows, choose 'Repair this Computer'. That will get you into the Windows Recovery Environment and from there you can try the various recovery options . .. 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10       
        </p>

            Hi  jimmutchie1,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

    <title>acer orbicam driver for windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ljimemad  say:</h3>
<h2>            acer orbicam driver for windows 7</h2>
                    Acer Orbicam came with my laptop, which originally had Windows XP. &nbsp;I recently installed Windows 7 and the camera doesn't work. &nbsp;I get a message that no camera is installed (or found), that a driver is needed, and this doesn't seem to be found in the computer.
 &nbsp;I have seen offers online for free downloads of the driver, but don't know if they are trustworthy, since they also seem to want to install other programs, like advertising. &nbsp;Is there any official site where I can get what I need to make the camera work?

<br />
<strong>References to Vista apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software <strong>
"IF"</strong> there are<br />
any for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS
<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
<span>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred
<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

            Hi Stephen, probably your best option is to go straight for 1803 manually
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi Stephen, Windows Update is installing these updates in error . . .
<br />
<br />You can hide those updates so Windows will not try to install them
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select those updates and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it:

<h2>            windows 7 professional.....how to get security access to view my external hard drives and external flash dirves</h2>
                    <p>I am a first time user to windows 7 Professional and need to learn how to get access to the files that are connected to the computer either by an external hard drive or by an external flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external hard drives or external flash drives can be connected to windows 8 or windows xp computers to view the files but when then identical external hard drives or external flash drives are connected to two different computers with windows 7 professional
 there are settings that automatically don ot all the access to the external hard drive or external flash drive files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When viewing computer it displays the external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When&nbsp; I left click on it it produces a pop up with title bar:&nbsp; Location is not available</p>
<p>The contents:&nbsp; H:| is not accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I right click on the external hard drive and then click on the security tab it displays:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Object name:&nbsp; H:|</p>
<p>To continue, you must be an administrative user with permission to view this object's security properties.</p>
<p>Do you want to continue?</p>
<p>Then i clicked on continue and it displayed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Owner</p>
<p>You do not have permission to view this object's security properties.&nbsp; To view its security properties, you can try taking ownership of the object.&nbsp; As the owner, you can also control who gets permissions on the object.&nbsp; Please not that once you take ownership,
 the previous owner might not have access to the object.</p>
<p>To try taking ownership of the object, select an account from the list, and then click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Object name:&nbsp; H:|</p>
<p>Current owner:&nbsp; Unable to display current owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change owner to:</p>
<p>the two choices are my name or Administrators</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then chose one and apply and ok and it did not work.</p>
<p>I then chose the other and apply and ok and it did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i clicked on other users or groups and entered everyone and that did not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the sole user of this brand new computer.</p>
<p>When i click on control panel then user accounts and family safety and then user accounts it displays my name as administrator password protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the steps so that I can buy an external hard drive or buy a flash drive or use the ones i already have and use them with this computer that has windows 7 professional?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come the switch of the ownership did not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to security again and this time went to the bottom section for special permissions or advanced settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again I kept getting Location is not available</p>
<p>H:\ is not accessible.</p>
<p>Access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you modify windows 7 Professional so that you can get access to your own files on an external hard drive or an external flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please list the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>This problem has been solved working with highest level support at HP for Z book 17 mobile workstation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps involved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) determine that it is not NTFS problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) using MSCONFIG the problem was isolated to a single service</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this service was unchecked and after reboot the problem with access to files was resolved.</p>

</p><p>Findings:&nbsp; HP had installed software on the HP Z book 17 notebook or mobile workstation that by default setting block communication with external hard drives and external flash drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This software HP Client Security overrides or blocks any right click setting changes from becoming manifest.&nbsp; It blocks ownership change.&nbsp; It blocks administrator privilege.&nbsp; It blocks everyone from being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP Client Security software was modified and changed from deny privileges (the default setting) to allow communication to the external drives.&nbsp; When going in the setting for this software it now makes a humming noise and I may need to download drivers
 and software again to see if this problem gets fixed too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input.&nbsp; I spent a lot of time on this and did not understand why all the right click methods had failed.&nbsp; The HP software default setting of deny had trumped all right click changes.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Bluetooth Mouse - Scroll Up quits</h2>
                    <p>I have had this mouse for about 2 years and it has been working fine, but after one of the Windows 10 updates, it started to balk using the scroll wheel. I can always scroll down, but it only scrolls up for 2 or 3 clicks of the wheel, then it stops responding
 to further scroll-up clicks. The problem behavior occurs in all applications. I have tried updated the Mouse and Keyboard Center software (now at version 3.2.116), and I tried updating the driver, and I tried removing and reinstalling the driver; no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Rob,</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick response, but I tried all those things previously, and more than once. I re-read some of the articles, but most of them deal with complete lack of function, whereas my situation is that it works for two or three clicks up, then quits
 for awhile until I scroll down some; then it works for 2 or 3 more clicks up and quits again. None of the linked articles address this scenario, and none of the proposed solutions change the behavior.</p>

            Why would you give&nbsp;a volunteer a bad review for trying to help? You did not post that you had already checked those resources so it would have been incompetent not to include them - and I added you did say you had already performed many (the ones you mentioned
 in your question) of them. i.e. You did not state you had tried a Clean Boot or other steps included in them.<br />
<br />
And I included how to contact Microsoft Support direct if needed which is what I would do if you have followed all of those troubleshooting steps.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>What about Middleclick for AutoScroll?&nbsp; Also, you should mention which program you have noticed this in.&nbsp; E.g. I think both IE and Edge get into strange scrolling states which may have more to do with the web site than the browser or the mouse.&nbsp; Lately
 I have even been having to find workarounds for getting to the top of these Answers input frames using the keyboard.&nbsp; So, if that is where the observations were coming from it wouldn't be just the mouse that would be involved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Otherwise, in case it is a hardware problem and since you have MMKC I imagine you could use its mousinfo tool to test your wheel.&nbsp; E.g. click on its Scrolling Monitor tab and try spinning your wheel.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Movie Maker Messing Up Sound&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theblackdeatharcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker Messing Up Sound&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>On Sunday, I started working for a school project that involved me using windows movie maker. We are required to have audio, so, as asked, I placed an audio file that would fit to my movie. After a certain period of time, I would replay the movie to make
 sure it matched to the music and such, but suddenly, the audio would randomly cut out, while the movie still continued to play. I thought this might be a Movie Maker problem, so I published the unfinished movie and played it with Windows Media Player. Still,
 the sound would randomly cut off (about every 55 seconds I believe) while the movie continued to play. If I pressed either of the volume buttons on my laptop, the music would resume, but would cut off again after another 55 seconds. Today, it started doing
 this on iTunes as well. I have Windows 7 Home Premium. The audio I am using was bought directly from iTunes, and any audio file I used afterwards would do the same thing.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try to play a different music file on the system and check whether you encounter this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you referring to Windows live movie maker?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 operating system do you use?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not done that, then I would suggest you to check whether the sound cuts off randomly when you play other music files on
 the system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue started occurring recently, I would suggest you to do a system restore to the previous point when the system was working fine and check whether the issue
 is resolved. Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong>Start</strong>,
 type <strong>system restore</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click<strong>System Restore</strong> in the
<strong>Programs</strong> list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click<strong>Continue</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the<strong>System Restore</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click<strong>Next</strong> .
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click<strong>Next</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong>Finish</strong>.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<div>I&nbsp;would recommend you to perform clean boot.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</div>
<div>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;
<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>I suggest you to uninstall the Mouse drivers and try to re-install them.</div>
<div>To uninstall drivers from the device manager follow these steps:</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Start.</strong></div>
<div>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <strong>â€œDevice Managerâ€ </strong>in the search box.</div>
<div>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</div>
<div>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the<strong> arrow </strong>beside <strong>Mice and other pointing devices
</strong>to expand it.</div>
<div>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now <strong>uninstall </strong>the <strong>mouse drivers&nbsp;</strong>by right clicking on the device and selecting
<strong>Uninstall</strong> from the context menu. A dialog box will open asking you if you really wish to uninstall the driver. Click<strong> Yes</strong>, then
<strong>OK </strong>in the next window.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Install the drivers from the manufacturerâ€™s website.</div>
<div>Refer the following link to get latest software -

<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            <p>I also have a Logitech mouse with the tilting wheel.&nbsp; There are several current driver versions but I chose the one that was compatible with both Win7 &amp; WinXP [merely because I use both machines &amp; thought I'd want to use it on both].&nbsp; Is the this the same
 as you are using?&nbsp; It works on my Win7x64 system.</p>

<p>Now I've gone back to check the link before giving it to you I cannot find the separate offerings - if I select XP it still offers the same download.&nbsp; This has changed within the past two months.</p>

            <p>I have already performed the 'clean boot' process as reccomended by the first support answer and it did nothing.</p>
<p>I Don't have a Logitech mouse and cannot understand why you would reccomend that action? It's the wheel I am having problems with and not my mouse.</p>
<p>The wheel is the G25 by Logitech but will not work with 'Live for Speed'. I get a text showing on opening the game stating that 'it can't support the FF device'.</p>
<p>On my XP computer the wheel works okay and did on this one before I installed a new Hard Drive.</p>
<p>I reinstalled Windows Home premium and it hasn'tr worked properly ever since. This leads me to thinking, as I stated before, that it is possibly a windows update that has caused the issue?<br />

                    I have an Samsung S3 Galaxy.&nbsp; I have two computers one running Windows 7 and the other Windows 8.&nbsp; At one time, the phone and computers were synced, at least the all my mail (Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail) and my Firefox browsers were all synced together.&nbsp;
 Since then...&nbsp; I don't know why they are not anymore. <br />
<br />
My question then, how do I get them talking to one another again, or is this a permanent split?<br />

<h2>            changed power supply and had to re-install windows</h2>
                    I recently bought a new power supply and installed it. I have an OEM version of windows 7 home premium and understand that if I was to change out the motherboard I would have to acquire a new windows key, but I was surprised that after installing my new
 PSU I had to re-install windows. I don't it's fair to spend $100 plus just because I changed the PSU. It's not like I built a new computer. Please help.

<h2>            Poor Display Performance after Windows 7 &#40;64-bit&#41; installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I upgraded the OS on my laptop from Windows 7 Professional (32-bit) to Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit). The installation went along smoothly and I upgraded all the necessary drivers (including the display driver) using "Windows Update". Unfortunately,
<strong>the graphics performance has become quite poor</strong>. There are <strong>
thin, blurry, horizontal lines</strong> which have appeared all over the display. These lines are
<strong>more dominant when I hover over any icon or open any photo or play any video, and thus reduce the image quality</strong>. I tried re-installing the display driver from NVidia website, but if did not help. This problem remains even after I change the
 display resolution. Kindly refer to the attached photograph for your reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what I can do to sharpen and improve my picture quality. Am I missing any crucial driver update? This is really messing my head. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            &#34;svchost.exe &#40;netsvcs&#41;&#34; is hijacking my whole bandwidth &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>greetings all :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from day one with windows 10 i noticed that -at times- my PC acts like its not connected to the network though my router is up and working !</p>
<p>
</p><p>at first i thought it was the windows automatic update, but after i -as advised- configured the BITS to the maximum of 10 kbps, nothing changed !</p>
<p>
</p><p>what could it be and how do i end this please ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>note: dont get me wrong here, i know that&nbsp;"svchost.exe (netsvcs)" is how windows -or other apps- gain access to the internet, my question is: why is it taking my whole bandwidth while it should only utilize the idle part of it ?</p>
<p>and how can i "correct" this i.e. force it to utilize only the idle bandwidth, instead of having to constantly "end the process" from the "resource monitor" time after time !
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you in advance :)</p>

</p><p>i read the <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/page/faq#faqAskQuestion5">Microsoft Community Code of Conduct</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=---&gt; "<span>No one replied to my question or discussion. Should I post it again?</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No. Posting the same question or discussion multiple times creates distraction. Just wait--someone will reply, and you'll be notified when it happens."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thats ok, but as you can see its almost 3 months and not a single reply else than that reply that is not relevant whatsoever !</p>
<p>
</p><p>what do i do now please ?</p>

            Since you will post the same exact issue, it will be best if you can provide us more information regarding your concern as well as the troubleshooting steps you have performed so we can come up with a resolution to the issue.

<h2>            Better Together, purchases and family accounts</h2>
                    <p>My kids and I&nbsp;have been playing Minecraft Xbox One Edition for a while, and I&nbsp;have purchased many skins, packs, maps, etc.. Since I'm the parent, I purchased these under my Xbox Live account, and my kids were able to use them without any problems, as they were set up as family accounts under mine.</p><p><br />With the new&nbsp;"Better Together", I can download/use the available skins/maps/packs&nbsp;with my account, but for both my kids they only have the option to purchase them. It's like this game has no concept of child/family accounts. Is there a way to fix this? There's no way I'm spending the $ 3 times so that all 3 of us have the same skins/packs/maps, etc...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I would like to second this. I'm seeing the same thing between my account and my daughter's account. With the Xbox One Edition, content was shared. I'd really like that to be the case for the new "Minecraft" version. I really don't have any desire to buy content multiple times.</p>

            <p>same here, i only had the chinese mythology mashup addon&nbsp;and purchased it again on my sons account (i still think it is a bug), now i still cannot use it under my son's account&nbsp;because the game give me a error that they can't process the order with the question if i have connection to the internet, i think because of parental policy's. I tried to tune them but it is still not working.</p><p><br /></p><p>Under my account everything is working fine.</p><p><br /></p><p>How do we fix this??</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;posted about this in the support section - also contacted live chat and they said this:</p><p>"Eros T<br />once the migration is complete your children will be able to see the skins again on their account.<br />19:00<br />Me<br />you're saying they will be able to use my purchased skins/packs/dlc on their account on our home console on Minecraft Better Together?<br />19:01<br />Me<br />definitely absolutely?<br />19:01<br />Eros T<br />Yes. Your children will be able to see the contents again once the migration is complete. This is just because of the new engine."</p><p><br /></p><p>That was a week ago, still waiting.&nbsp; Like SandmanLG, I've had to tell my kids they can't have any Minecraft DLC, it's just not viable to repurchase the various packs for each account. I worked out it'd cost me over Â£100 just to restore the skins &amp; textures from MCXB1.</p>
