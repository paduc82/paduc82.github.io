            Hi Harv.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Since you need a driver to get it recognized by Windows Fax &amp; Scan, you might as well install the full printer software to also get bi-directional scanning from printer top and fax if needed.  
<br />
<br />You can run the Printer Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.

<p>I have two Multi function device. One is brother, the other Xerox. </p>
<p>All was working just fine up until a few days ago.</p>
<p>Now, only the Brother appears in Fax and Scan. And, the option,&nbsp; scan to&nbsp; XPS, is not available.</p>

            Hi Harv.  
<br />
<br />No I didn't need any more detail.  I gave you what works best with printers every time.   
<br />
<br />Remove all printer drivers and software from both printers with them disconnected.  Then add them back one at a time following the printer installation steps I gave.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>That is a lot of work, So, I Just need to know before I go ahead and remove all the printer software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple configurations for each printer. (i.e. 14", 11" booklet, two sided, etc.)</p>
<p>Is removing the printer software going to impact those configuration, or will I need to redo everything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printers<strong><em>are </em></strong>available for printing, I just can't get the Xerox to show in the Fax / Scan utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, This may take a few days, so how do I get back to this post?</p>

            If the printers had been set up correctly then you wouldn't be using Windows Fax and Scan - which is reserved for old scanners that are too old to install their own software - but would have the printers own software providing the scanning bi-directionallly from the printer top which is where most want to scan from.  Windows Scan only works from the PC and for a newer printer wastes that software that the printer maker provides for these important functions.

<p>Greg</p>
<p>I prefer to scan <em>from </em>the desktop.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, the&nbsp; printers are set up correctly. The Brother works fine with the supplied software (updated of course)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xerox, ( bought it for the 2 sided and booklet features) came with the worst software any one could imagine. There is no software interface with the printer for scanning from the computer.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled, reinstalled a number of times. </p>
<p>I could scan from the printer top, to the computer. </p>
<p>When using fax and scan, I was able&nbsp; to scan from the computer, to an XPS doc ( as there is not an option for PDF)&nbsp; and then print to PDF.
</p>
<p>Suddenly I can do none of that with the Xerox, but I can still print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a number of computers here, so to clear out the printer software from all of them will be quite a task.
</p>
<p>I don't think I need to do&nbsp; anything with the Brother</p>
<p>I will&nbsp; do the Xerox first&nbsp; on one computer.</p>

            Printers with older or scant software can become deprecated or dysfunctional with Version or regular Windows Updates.  You can test this by rolling back the Update in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Update History.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.

<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.

<h2>            windows 7 version 1607</h2>
                    I really need help with upgrading my windows 10 latest version 1607. I am not really that savvy with all the technical stuff so here goes.&nbsp; I did ask a question of how much data I would need to upgrade from windows 7 to windows 10 and someone suggested
 that it was only around 4gb. I only have a 7gb data on my mobile. Yesterday I decided to upgrade the latest windows update and it took almost 5gb, I need help to complete this upgrade, so some help with this would be appreciated.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you mentioned that you almost used up the remaining disk space in your hard drive, we suggest that you free up some of your disk space for a seamless upgrade. You can follow the steps below to perform a Disk Clean Up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Delete temporary files:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file. An ISO file is a digital replica of a virtual disc, which users will have to make bootable on a blank DVD, USB thumb drive or SD card.">

<h2>            BSOD with SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION &#40;IGDKMD64.SYS on DEL E7440 with docking station</h2>
                    <p>I get this BSOD with the dociking station running twin monitors, sometimes when I plug in a USB device, sometimes when switching between the Windows 7 screen and Windows 8 screen, sometimes starting Lync on a screen grab tool (Snip).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It never occurs when I am not using the docking station. I think it only occurs when there are two montitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a earlier graphics driver but updated it as the screens would sometimes go fuzzy for a few seconds, then go blank and then recover.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the power supply may be innsufficient at 19.5V 6.7A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not very experienced in debugging but have managed to decode the MEMORY.DMP a little bit.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like some pointers what to do next. Thank you</p>

    <title>Missing offline help files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> comprev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing offline help files&#63;</h2>
                    I did a clean install of Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on 2 laptops. One appears to be ok, the other appers to be missing the offline help files. If you go to Start|Help and Support to open Help, it comes up with a little blurb about Defender. Clicking the
 Offline/Online button in the lower right and telling Help to go online will give the expected Help files.<br />
<br />
I looked in Windows Components under Programs and Settings (Add/Remove Programs) and didn't see an option here to add the Help files. How do I get the offline Help files working?

            what exactly does the "little blurb" say? <br />
<br />
all the offline help files should be loaded with the OS. If they are not there, you may have had some corruption on the install, and as this is a new install, you may just want to start over (what I would do anyways)<br />

            No, this isn't it. I'm fully aware of this problem with WinHlp32.exe. I'm talking about the built-in help files. These are the ones you would access from Start|Help and Support.

<p>
</p><p>Note that after you've listen to a voice message, it will be transferred from our servers to your device's local hard drive meaning you can no longer listen to it on a different device. See this FAQ for additional details.

<h2>            Help with Win XP server 2 NIC Cards - trying to route__</h2>
                    Hello,I am trying to find the best way to handle the situation below.<br />
<br />
I have a network with 3 terminals, static IP addresses of 10.10.0.x subnet of 255.0.0.0.&nbsp; They are connected to a switch.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The switch is connected to a server with 2 NIC cards, one is 10.10.0.100 static and the other is 192.168.1.4 (DHCP, and I don't have the subnet of this one).The 192.168.1.4 card on the server is connected to a DSL Router (192.168.1.254).<br />
<br />
I am trying to get an application on one of the terminals to be able to connect to a web service on the internet (it is a specific IP address).&nbsp; For various reasons, I can't bridge the connections on the server or change anything else with regards to network
 settings.&nbsp; I was trying to use the ROUTE command, but couldn't get it to work.<br />
<br />
I have enabled IP routing on the XP machine with 2 NIC's.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will the ROUTE command work?&nbsp; If so, what would be the proper syntax?&nbsp; I am looking for a unobtrusive method of allowing the 1 terminal to reach the 1 web service on the internet.&nbsp; I don't need complete access, just need to be able to get to the one IP address.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            If you can install software on the 2-NIC computer, you might be able to find a NAT program that can share the 192.168.1.x network's Internet access with the 10.10.0.x network.&nbsp; Long ago, I used a program called Sygate that could do that.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, this might do what you want.&nbsp; I haven't tested it, and I don't know if your DSL router will accept traffic that originates in a different subnet:<br />
<br />
1. Create a route on the terminal to send traffic for Internet site w.x.y.z through the 2-NIC server:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; route add w.x.y.z mask 255.255.255.255 10.10.0.100<br />
<br />
2. Create a route on the DSL router to send traffic for the terminal through the 2-NIC server.&nbsp; If the terminal is 10.10.0.1:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; route add 10.10.0.1 mask 255.255.255.255 192.1681.4<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this wouldn't work if the DHCP server ever changed the 2-NIC server's 192.168.1.x address.<br />
<br />
If you could change the network settings, a solution would be to enable Windows XP's Internet Connection Sharing on the 2-NIC server's router connection, which would change the other network to 192.168.0.x.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to help you bypass network security restrictions, am I?&nbsp; :-)<br />

 time when I changed my password I called Xbox support for some help. After about 30 minutes of being on the phone, my friend that also plays xbox texted me saying that his friend accidentally signed into my account (I had recovered my profile on that console
 a while back, but I had it back on my xbox for a few months now) That was why it signed me out, but when his friend signed onto my profile he didn't have to enter any emails or passwords, he didn't even have to download/recover the account. It just signed
 him right on.</p>

<p>Then just a few minutes ago I needed to sign in a guest, but it wouldn't let so i signed onto my friends profile (The same friend who's console I had my account signed onto) When I chose his profile
 it signed me right in without passwords or needing to download it. I was able to play on it like he had actually recovered it.</p>

<p>This needs to be fixed ASAP, most people don't think about deleting their profiles from other consoles because once they recover it back on their own xbox, they know that if someone wanted to
 sign onto it from another xbox they would need his email and password.</p>

<p>This is something new that came along with the latest dashboard update. When you download your account onto another console it asks if you want it to remember your password or not. If you choose to have it remember your password it will still let your account
 sign in even if you have recovered your account back to your own xbox. </p>
<p>This page has information on how you can remotely password protect your account so that nobody can sign in to your account -

<br />
There should be another number for the graphcis chip as well, but<br />
If it is a&nbsp; GMA X3000 it is DX9 (or older) only, and not compatible with DX10.<br />
- You would need a GMA X3100 chip, or newer version, to run in DX10, but<br />
even then it is not likely to be capable of running this game.<br />
The newer Intel HD graphics, which is part of the cpu, is a fair bit more capable.<br />
<br />
You could still try installing more recent drivers, if you laptop mfg has them.<br />

            Have you checked for driver updates for your laptops graphics as suggested ?<br />
<br />
It does not matter if DX is updated (Win7 has DX9, 10 &amp; 11, btw). The graphics processor<br />
has to be capable of using DX10.<br />
However, even if your Intel graphics is the DX 10 compatible version, this game has a minimum<br />
requirement of 512MB VRAM, and if you were able to up the 'shared' system RAM from<br />
256MB to 512MB the Intel graphics chip on your machine would still not be powerful enough
<br />
to run the game.<br />
<br />
Your system is not likely suitable for this game, but it <i>may</i> (if you are lucky) be able to run the
<br />
original NFS-MW.<br />

<h3> persifal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Registry Wow64 corruption</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I tried to get a clean Registry, for performance purpose.</p>
<p>I am concerned with a registry corruption in : wow6432 in System Software</p>
<p>The case:</p>
<p>I reinstall from scratch Vista Ultimate 64. disk format</p>
<p>I ran Onecare Registry cleanUp everything is fine, I dind't make any Onecare correction, just an inspection.<br />
Then install KB935509, KB949939, KB938371, KB937287 and then Vista SP1<br />
Installtion was fine and successful.</p>
<p>I ran Onecare Registry cleanUp again ... Then It LOOPS for ever, <br />
I canceled, it replies Ok but still running. I have to kill the process.</p>
<p>A year ago I had the same problem, but after 2 ou 3 hours the Onecare cleaner running<br />
show thousands of bad entries in System Software WOw6432.</p>
<p>I have this problem since I got Vista 2 years ago.</p>
<p>Before re-installing Vista and SP1 I removed devices has much as I can, to get a very basic installation.</p>
<p>Special drivers are NVIDIA nforce 570, ATI 600Pro PCI-Ex16, and C and D disk in hardware Raid 1.</p>
<p>My computer can run with it, but does-it impair my performance ?</p>
<p>Now I will reinstall Vista and every update separatly, to detect which one bug the registry ... hours of fun.<br />
<br />
Before reinstalling I ran multiple of differents registry scanner with all having the same problem.<br />
<br />
I ran diskcheck evrything even the SFC program.</p>
<p>Thanks for any clue !<br />

            Registry cleaners usually do more harm than good.&nbsp; It's always a good idea to have good Restore Points and utilize that instead of Registry Cleaners.&nbsp; CCleaner seems to be a good one, but I still stick clear of Registry cleaners.<br />

    <title>Windows Update and Delivery Optimization burning through data on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calebklein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update and Delivery Optimization burning through data on metered connection</h2>
                    <p>I have set up my network as a metered connection. I have limited data and can't stand when Windows downloads away my credit without asking. This has worked fine until now, Windows Update doesn't do any unsolicited downloading unless I tell it to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now task manager is telling me that two processes - Windows Update and Delivery Optimization - are taking up pretty much all of my bandwidth doing God knows what. Every time I end the processes they spring back up within 30 seconds. Loading this web page
 was almost impossible because it's basically hijacking my network. I'm probably losing a lot of money just being connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some searching, and I found the following solutions.&nbsp;<br />
To stop Windows Update from wasting data: Set as a metered connection.&nbsp;<br />
To stop Delivery Optimization: turn off the "updates from more than one place" setting under update settings &gt; advanced &gt; choose how updates are delivered.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have done both of these things, and these two processes are still wasting my internet and refuse to stop. I don't know what else to do other than not use the internet, which is unacceptable. Please tell me how to put this off until I am on an unlimited connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sick and tired of Microsoft forcing automatic updates on us. By all means give us an annoying update alert every 24 hours, but stop assuming everyone is ok with automatic updates. Windows Update feels less like a useful tool and more like despicable
 malware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Caleb,<br />
<br />
Since Windows Update and Delivery Optimization are already set up to your metered connection, it won't automatically download and send updates. Setting them to Metered disables the automatic downloading of most Windows updates, automatic downloading of app
 updates, peer-to-peer uploading of updates and auto update of Tiles.<br />
<br />
They're still run in the background because Windows Update and Delivery Optimization are routinely checking your system for security and performance. For more information about Metered Internet connections, check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17452/windows-metered-internet-connections-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. To review on how to configure Delivery Optimization, check on this
<strong><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-windows-update-delivery-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />

            Well maybe it's not downloading UPDATES, although I noticed you specified "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">disables the automatic downloading of MOST Windows updates". It's downloading SOMETHING using as much of my bandwidth as it
 can take. I list task manager by network usage and Service Host: Local System jumps to the top with massive data usage. If I forcibly end Windows Update or Delivery Optimisation the data usage decreases for a second and then increases again. If I end them
 both, the data usage disappears until they start themselves up again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WHATEVER they are downloading, they are wasting my money as long as I am connected to the internet. Why? How do I stop it? How does "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">routinely checking your system for security and performance" require
 downloading gigabytes of data?</span>

<p>We suggest that to manage your connection consume for Windows Update and Delivery Optimization is to configure Delivery Optimization through Group Policy and Windows Update by deferring the Windows Update.<br />
<br />
For more information on how to use Group Policy to configure Windows Update Delivery Optimization in Windows 10, check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/3088114/how-to-use-group-policy-to-configure-windows-update-delivery-optimization-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Deferring Windows upgrades prevent your device from getting the latest Windows features downloaded or installed for several months. It doesn't affect any security updates. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Settings</strong> in <strong>Cortana Search</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> and click <strong>Advance Options</strong> under
<strong>Update settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Check the tick box for <strong>Defer feature updates</strong>.<br />

<p>So your solutions are to "configure" Windows Update Delivery Optimization (Nowhere on that page does it say what you're configuring it to do, which makes it sound like you're setting it up to run normally, which is NOT what I want) and to use a feature that
 most Windows 10 Home users don't have access to.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In other words no fix at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But don't worry, it's too late. I took an emergency trip to my university to let Windows Update run rampant for a few hours with no data restrictions. I can safely say that if I had used the internet at home for any length of time it would have cost me a
 lot of money. So the only solution I could find for this problem was not using my internet at all until I had a controlled environment in which to let it do its damage. Microsoft had no fixes for me. They just wanted to force more updates down my throat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I can describe any program as "something that left unchecked will cost me a lot of money" I think malware. Windows Update now ticks that box, with apparently no help in sight from its creators. I've had enough. My internet connection is not something
 you can exploit freely. Stop this stupid crusade of forcing updates on the masses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As today I resumed my PC from hibernation, the network icon in taskbar reports with yellow exclamation mark. In Network and Sharing Center it reports no Internet access via Ethernet, and Private Network. However, Network Adapter shows clearly Ethernet is
 running normal "Network", not something like "network cable unplugged".</p>

<p>I've tried multiple times resetting network, disable and enable adapter, uninstall driver and update to latest version as instructed on Microsoft's support page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I can do most of my job without problem accessing Internet via browsers (Microsoft Edge and Chromium Edge both works fine and is where I am currently writing this post from), Onedrive, and other softwares, but since Windows keeps reporting "no access",
 I cannot connect in Office apps, UWP apps, except for Windows Update and Microsoft Store. I can't even log in to Feedback Hub right now!</p>

            Hi 卞朝阳
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi 卞朝阳:
<br />
<br /> I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.   
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem  PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />If you're using a router try plugging into the Modem.  You're also entitled to tech Support from your IP provider to get the speeds you pay for, which is included in your bill. 
<br /> 
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a> 
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            Well actually after a day it restored normal. No idea what to do with drivers or system configurations, just automatically restored. LAN issue? Without further log, I'll simply close this question. Thanks for the advises anyway!

<h2>            Windows 7 shows Waiting for Task Host Window on restart or shutdown</h2>
                    Whenever I shut down or restart my computer I get a screen that says "Waiting for Task Host Window" I have tried cleaning the registry, I have done a chkdsk, I have ran sfc/scannow several times now and this issue will not go away. &nbsp;I am running Windows
 7 64 bit with 4GB ram. I have also tried to apply the hotfix, but I always get "This update is not applicable to your computer." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            I have had the same problem. At restart or shutdown I kept getting the message (waiting for) task host window to close. But the screen was unresponsive and the option to cancel and return to windows would not work. My CPU was fully occupied for no good
 reason. &nbsp;I discovered that the solution was to uuninstall Google drive. Hope this helps somebody.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
                    <p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately I've been experimenting with various apps that use the "Eisenhower Matrix" that categorizes priorities in terms of urgency and importance. &nbsp;So I searched Microsoft and discovered this little known app: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/eisenhower-matrix/9wzdncrdmw08#system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/eisenhower-matrix/9wzdncrdmw08#system-requirements</a>.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be developed by an "indie" guy, and adopted into the Microsoft-verse. &nbsp;Is it something that Microsoft is going to formally adopt into its Office 365 suite? &nbsp;Is Microsoft working on its own version? &nbsp;Can one of Microsoft's existing products
 be augmented to include an Eisenhower Matrix feature? &nbsp;(I'm thinking Excel or Access). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance,</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t hear anyone in Party Chat but theycan hear me. I can only hear&#43;talk to others in Game Chat.</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, I started having an issue with the Party chat. My friends are able to hear me as normal and it shows that they are talking. I can't hear anyone though. I can only hear them for a fraction of a second after joining the party&nbsp;and then I hear nothing&nbsp;I have tried hard-restarts, factory resets, mic settings, and pretty much everything else on the Xbox Support page and other pages like it. The weird part is that I can only hear people if we are in Game Chat. I want to get this fixed because I have been on hold for hours at a time for phone support just for them to tell me to hard-reset or hold the power button. There are games I want to play that are singlt-player but I can't hear&nbsp;to people in Party Chat if I do. It's a really dumb situation and it's been this way for a few days now. If anyone has a suggestion that isn't just to turn it off and on again, It would at least&nbsp;be somewhat useful.</p>

<h2>            Apps were removed while resetting your PC&#33;&#33;   It&#39;s now version 1703.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Is there anyway to get a database file from the recovery drive??? &nbsp;Apparently the data base data was in the same folder as the program. When the program was removed so was the data. &nbsp;Can a single file be retrieved from the recovery drive?</p>

    <title>WIndows 10 Black Screen after USB Boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bahamutaxiom  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 Black Screen after USB Boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm going insane trying to fix this issue. I have tried restarting, booting safe mode (which I realized no longer works with Win10), and booting with the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these things end with either just a black screen after logo and spinning icon (for several hours as I slept, apprx. 6 hours), or just a black screen after saying Automatic Repair. I can't get to any menus after this to do anything useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the Boot to a USB flash drive, I went to the BIOS Boot Options and chose USB boot and still only get a lank black screen while the fan is running.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just removed all my stuff from my external hardrive to re format and this happens right after. I truly don't want to lose anything if my hardrive indeed has a problem if that is part of what I read as a list of three problems it could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hp pavillion g6 2323dx with 8 GB. There were no signs of my harddrive being corrupted beforehand ( at least any known ones to me). I also believe my drivers are up to date, though I could be wrong.
</p>
<p>If it helps, my laptop did begin to slow to a crawl, start freezing, and restarting on it's own. ( I wasn't there in person to witness it though.) I can't seem to find anyone with the same problem of not getting past the black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me if there's anymore info I can provide. Please help.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text
<strong>"Press</strong> <strong>any key </strong>to boot from <strong>CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.<br />
&nbsp;b) Select the <strong>correct time </strong>and Keyboard type.<br />
&nbsp;c) Click Repair your computer in the <strong>lower left corner</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;d) Select <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>from Choose an option screen.<br />
&nbsp;e) Click advanced options in <strong>Troubleshoot screen</strong>.<br />

<p>OK, after long hours of trying to solve this using this link: <a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-bootable-usb-flash-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a> and the normal way from microsoft.com through the media creation tool. I still get the same issues. It still gives a black screen immediately after the logo and spinning icon or right after saying Automatic Repair.
</p>
<p>When I ESC+Power button to BOOT Mode, it doesn't even read that I have a USB connected; only saying UEFI BOOT and OS BOOT.</p>
<p>So far, I'm having the same issue with this method of booting. Since I'm not sure if I have a 32 or 64 bit, I tried both and still get the same results upon startup and going to the boot menu.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you try creating Windows 10 installation media on a different USB drive and then try the below steps to check if it helps.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>1) Create installation media for windows 10.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer to the below link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</span></a><br />
2) Insert the Windows 10 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.<br />
3)&nbsp; Click on Repair your computer. <br />
4) Click on Troubleshoot and in the Advanced options.<br />
5) Select Command Prompt. <br />
6) Type the following commands into the prompt and press Enter key after each command.<br />
bootrec /fixmbr<br />
bootrec /fixboot<br />
bootrec /scanos<br />
bootrec /rebuildbcd <br />
7) Restart the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            If your Windows Installer bootable USB is loading a black screen, you have one of your ROM options disabled in your BIOS. Try resetting BIO to default settings.

    <title>Static noise in Xbox dashboard when connected to Live - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Static noise in Xbox dashboard when connected to Live</h2>
                    
<p>I have been experiencing this annoying pulsating static noise while on the xbox dashboard or using the system audio, video players. As soon as i enter a game or app it goes away. Initially believed to be my audio system, through troubleshooting&nbsp;I found this
 only happens while connected to Xbox Live no matter whether i use a wired connetion or wirelesss and the fact that i am using a fiber optic cable for audio rules out the chance of any static being picked up by it.</p>
<p>Is anyone else experiencing this, is there a solution? Or, is there a way to disconnect from Xbox live, without disconnecting from my home network, so I dont have to put up with annoying static noise while using the systems audio or video player to stream
 from my PC? (either than disconnecting my modem for the rest of the household).</p>

<p>I think it has to do with tv cable, some tv make static noise when there are bright colors on screen, this could be why you hear them in the dashboard and not in games.</p>
<p>I suggest to try to adjust your tv contrast or change tv cable.</p>

<p>I have completly isolated my xbox from my entertainment system and tested it on a different tv with only a different hdmi cable and the power adapter attached to it and connected to Live via wifi and I get the same noise.
</p>
<p>I may only conclude that it is an internal component/circuitry creating interference with the signal recieved by the networking component/circuitry while conected to Live and browsing the dashboard.</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>It is actual signal that is sent by Live during dashboard browsing. Although I highly doubt I would be the only one to notice or experience the latter.</p>

<p>It could be the Ratings Collection sound setting.</p>
<p>Go into the dashboard sound settings</p>
<p>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Console Settings -&gt; Audio</p>
<p>Look for the 'Ratings Collection Sound' setting and make sure it is turned off.</p>
<p>This setting causes a pulsing static like sound on the dashboard if it is switched on.</p>
<p>I believe this setting has something to do with TV ratings so unless you are one of those few people who's tv habits are recorded for ratings purposes then you should have this option switched off.</p>

<p>Malacath you are a savior!!! I have never seen that option in the audio menu before it must have been added in a fairly recent update. I have no Idea how it got turned on and I am the only one who uses this console. Why would this option exist what purpose
 does this backgroud noise serve and who would ever want it on? </p>
<p>Thanks again for helping me resolve this before I lost my mind and smashed the crap out of my console lol.</p>

<p>Yeah it's a stupid pointless setting that should never have been added. I actually thought my xbox was faulty because of this setting. I nearly bought a new xbox until I found this setting.</p>
<p>I did google it and it's something to do with tv ratings in america. So it's absolutley pointless being on anyones console if you live outside of america. It doesn't even warn you about the annoying sound if you enable it.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for knowing the answer to this. I thought it was a bad HDMI cable until I noticed it only occured when signed in to LIVE, then I suspected it was an electrical grounding feedback loop and moved my router across the room so it would be on
 a different circuit. When that didn't fix it, I was stumped... you've saved me from aggravation.</p>

<p>I have recently updated Windows 10 on Lenovo IdeaPad 520. However, when I try to login it is taking my pin stating "Pin is no longer available due to change in security settings". I can't remember my password. It doesn't let me reset the password as well
 as it required flash drive with password reset disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please help?&nbsp;</p>
