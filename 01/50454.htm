<h2>            Double tap on home button does nothing</h2>
                    <p>I just got a xbox one s for christmas and i am trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>I am trying to follow the instructions found&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/multitask-with-snap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> to get and snap menu to appear, but when I double tap the Xbox button on the controller nothing happens. If I single tap it&nbsp;takes me back to the home screen, and if I long press it give me options to shut down the console or controller.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Am I missing a setting somewhere that enables the double tap?</p>
<p>I am able to get snap to work by going to the home screen and going left to get the side menu, going all the way down to multitask, and snapping something that way, but that is a lot of steps and I would prefer to use the double tap.</p>
<p>Because double tap does not work I am also unable to double tap and press x to capture game clips</p>
<p>Please help</p>

            <p>Hey there RyanMc360!<br /><br />Do you have a USB cable you can plug into your controller to see if the issue occurs while wired? Make sure your controller is fully up to date, as well. A mistake some people make is pressing the button either too fast or too slow, if you can, try varying the speed of tapping the button to see if there's any change with that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to retrieve a saved file which was &#39;opened&#39; from email</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
My problem is as follows. <br />
<br />
I "opened" an attachment (word docx.) from my email. <br />
I worked on it for the whole days, and I have pressed 'save icon' like a million times throughout the day.
<br />
What is odd is when I reboot my computer, it was virtually impossible for me to locate the same file that&nbsp;I was working on.
<br />
The document is really important to me, is there anyway to retreive that same document? I tried to search the temporary folder (tho I could retreived the pictures that I have browsed, but not documents in the temporary folder), is there&nbsp;other&nbsp;hidden folders
 where the document would be saved to?&nbsp;Please help. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am using Vista.<br />
Thank you for your assistance, and I hope to hear from you soon.<br />

            You can also open Microsoft Word and look at the recent used files. It should be listed in there.<br />
You might want to check under user\Documents this is usually the default folder that word saves to when you don specify a location to be saved.<br />
If this is not the default location, open word type a test document and hit save, then go to save as, and see where the default save location is.<br />
<br />

            &gt; Hello,<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; My problem is as follows.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; I "opened" an attachment (word docx.) from my email.<br />
&gt; I worked on it for the whole days, and I have pressed 'save icon' like a million times throughout the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your Mail reader is OE or WinMail or WLMail that is incorrect technique.<br />
Attachments in those mail clients open only in the TIF.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; What is odd is when I reboot my computer, it was virtually impossible for me to locate the same file that? I was working on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, not. It all depends on what happened to the E-mail<br />
that you had opened in order to open the attachment. If you closed<br />
it *after* you closed Word the attachment file would have been<br />
deleted. If you had closed it while Word still had the document open<br />
there is a chance you could find it in your TIF. Note that Explorer will<br />
not search the TIF; so if it is there to find it you will have to use some<br />
other technique such as navigating to that directory in a command prompt<br />
(aka cmd window) and doing a dir/a/s *.docx for it<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; The document is really important to me, is there anyway to retreive that same document? I tried to search the temporary folder
<br />
&gt; (tho I could retreived the pictures that I have browsed, but not documents in the temporary folder), is there? other? hidden
<br />
&gt; folders where the document would be saved to?? Please help. ? ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know. I don't use Word. Best to ask in a Word forum or newsgroup. One chance of recovering some of it I imagine provided
<br />
you haven't used Word since would be looking for whatever files Word uses to implement an Undo feature. Again, a Word forum would
<br />
be the best place to learn about such an option if it in fact exists.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            When I Power My Computer It Goes To Troubleshoot or Turn Off PC Options</h2>
                    I have a Asus laptop running Windows 8.1. I previously had a virus that slowed down my computer and occasionally made it crash. When I had Norton delete it I restarted my computer and go onto a blue screen that said a part of my boot configuration data
 (bcd) is missing so I rebuild the bad using command prompt. When I restarted it it did not load to windows. Instead it loads to the screen that says troubleshoot and turn off your pc. When I clicked troubleshoot I tried 3 things. When I tried to refresh my
 pc it said the drive where windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again. When I tried to reset it it said unable to reset your pc. A required drive partition is missing. When I tried to restore it it said to use system restore you must specify
 which windows installation to restore. Restart this computer, select an operating system and then select system restore. When I restart my computer the process repeats into the troubleshooting blue screen. Please help!

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Screen Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timleisman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Screen Issues</h2>
                    <p>Just got my Surface Pro 4 (Intel i7) two days ago. In the process of getting started I've been seeing some issues that are concerning. I've already been on the phone with&nbsp;the help desk&nbsp;last night about the pen not working, but can't call them yet this morning.
 All drivers and firmware are fully updated as far as the system will tell me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Occasionally (seems to happen at random regardless of the brightness level or usage) the screen will begin to flicker. It's not just a section of the screen like some others have reported but the full screen. It's not quite bad enough that it prevents
 me from using, but bad enough (and often enough)&nbsp;to be incredibly annoying. Is this a glitch that can be resolved or a malfunction and I need to exchange my surface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Touch screen sensitivity is terrible when the keypad cover is folded back (but not using tablet mode). It made me look incredibly silly at work to be tapping parts of the screen over and over trying to get an app to open or a letter on the touch keypad
 to trigger. When it works, it works excellently, but occasionally it will just stop responding to touch. At first this seemed to be related to switching between using the stylus and a finger, but now I've seen it stop working without the stylus anywhere near.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with these two problems is appreciated.. Main things preventing me from enjoying my SP4!</p>

<h2>            Cannot Run System File Checker in Safe Mode</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my Windows 8.1 PC isn't running well out of Safe Mode, I tried running SFC (System File Checker) in Safe Mode. When I do I get the following error message: Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Kaden Warner</p>

<h2>            Unable to install updates message Windows Update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running (Vista 64)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am getting the message: "Windows Update cannot currently check for updates, because the service is not running.&nbsp; You may need to restart your computer."&nbsp; I have restarted with no change.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have Vista 64 bit with MSE installed and it can't update it's virus database.&nbsp; I also have Windows Media Center set up as a TV and it cannot download an updated Guide.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me?&nbsp; I just completed a Malwarebytes complete scan and a MSE complete scan - both in Safe Mode with Networking.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have found a few other forums similar to my problem, but I don't know that they are the same as mine.&nbsp; I am a little leery about some of the suggested fixes, so I thought I would get suggestions directly related to my problem.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>MS&#47;Windows Updates are a disaster - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claggan  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS&#47;Windows Updates are a disaster</h2>
                    Like so many others I am on a metered connection ... with a limited download capacity. Ever since the arrival of W10 updates have become a nightmare. No information on sizes &nbsp;... despite the very large (cumulative) updates. But worst of all is the repeated
 'failed to install' messages. I have been in the IT business since 1970. And I am totally fed up with this attitude towards people like me who wish to be in control of our own destiny. I am now downloading Linuxmint ... and will gradually switch everything
 over to it. You have really ticked me off this past year.

<p>If you are using a wifi connection, you can set it to "metered" in the settings app. That will hold most of the update demons in their cage until you are on another connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a pro version, you can control automatic updates via group policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to: Group Policy Editor &gt; Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update &gt; Configure Automatic Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either set the policy as "Enabled" with option 2: "Notify for download and notify for install" or disable the policy completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I both set the connection to metered and use group policy. That way updates only come in when I allow them; not when Microsoft wants to install them. I usually wait a few weeks after an update is released before installing it to make sure it
 isn't a botched update (something MS is putting out a lot of these days).</p>

</p><blockquote>... I am totally fed up with this attitude towards people like me who wish to be in control of our own destiny...</blockquote>
<p>Windows 10 is not the best choice when you have limited bandwidth. That's because Windows 10 is software-as-a-service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What that means, practically speaking, is that Windows 10 consists of an initial download followed by continuous updates. The updates are not optional 'extras,' they're part of the operating system. Updates to Windows will be downloaded and installed to
 your computer on a regular basis, and that's going to use up a limited bandwidth connection in a hurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft didn't invent software-as-a-service but Windows 10 is arguably the first version of Windows that works like that. Microsoft sometimes calls Windows 10 'Windows-as-a-service.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ways that you can manage the use of your bandwidth - like setting your computer as a metered connection or deferring updates - but the same bits will be downloaded anyway, sooner or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can influence your destiny, but you can't control it. You'll realize that in a hurry when you apply for a mortgage, if you haven't already, regardless of what operating system you're using.</p>

<p>It seems from what I am seeing from others that this problem is extremely common with latest Windows update. I can not think of anything enabled or added that would cause this problem it&nbsp;immediately occurred after update.</p>

<p>Hi again Allan - I still can't figure how to get actual screenshot in here but I just did a copy and paste which just gave the following. Perhaps that is all you need - Let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have said before, Since I did that last update everything has started to go slow. - I reckon initial start up is now slower than way back before even 7. Even just loading Microsoft Edge for example takes probably at least&nbsp;double the time it used to
 and as I am sure you know I am not the only one complaining. Never had an issue like this with Windows before and have always found improvements with updates. Not so this time.</p>

<p>Have you already tried running the <strong>Microsoft Easy fix tool</strong>? Also, may we know the
<strong>Disk utilization</strong> of your <strong>PC</strong> (also found on <strong>
Task Manager&gt;Performance</strong>)? It is possible that a certain service has suddenly been enabled, increasing<strong> CPU load
</strong>and <strong>disk usage</strong>. After running the <strong>Microsoft Easy fix tool</strong> to no avail, we recommend doing these following steps too:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box, search and open <strong>Services.</strong></li><li>Scroll down to find<strong> Windows Search</strong></li><li>Right-click it, and select <strong>Properties.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Stop</strong> and change the <strong>Startup type</strong> to <strong>
Disabled.</strong></li><li>Save the changes.</li><li>Scroll down to find <strong>Superfetch</strong> and repeat steps 3-5.</li></ol>

<p>Hi again Allan - I did run The Easy Fix yesterday and it said it made some changes but made no difference to performance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk usage is 1%&nbsp; and speed is 1.61GHz to 1.68GHZ with no programs running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Did the above 1-6 and then a restart - No change and perhaps even worse - Should I put it back where it was - If yes please advise those original settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a look at one of the responses I got from "Angie" - She sums it up beautifully and will give you a laugh - Is this much awaited update happening&nbsp;on January 30&nbsp;?</p>
<p>

<p>Many thanks Gianni - Will try all this. I keep getting replies from Microsoft with all sorts of suggestions and things to do but so far nothing has made any difference - May even be worse - Very frustrating and I&nbsp;am warning all my friends not to do this
 latest update.</p>

<p>We're currently investigating what's actually causing this issue and as of the moment. In the past few weeks, we did out best to release patch notes to cover the holes made by
<strong>Meltdown </strong>and <strong>Spectre:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Spectre</strong> is a vulnerability that affects all CPUs. It performs branch prediction, a branch prediction is the process of guessing which way a branch (i.e. an if-and-or-there-else program function) will go, which could be used by potential
 attackers to reveal secret operating system and hardware data.<br />
</li><li><strong>Meltdown</strong> is a hardware vulnerability with allow a rouge process to read all memory, including the system memory. To put it simply, Meltdown "melts" the security boundaries of normal applications and kernel applications, allowing potential
 attackers/data thief/pirate to access hardware's and operating system's secrets. There is a twist, the thinner the boundary, the faster the PC speed gets in exchange of security. The tighter the boundary, the slower the PC gets.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the patch released by Intel for your CPU driver or the patch that we released somehow slowed down your PC's performance. As of the moment, there are no reports in which an attacker used Spectre and Meltdown to do some illegal stuff but
 it is always nice to prevent something bad from happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're doing our best to find what really is causing this issue and if we find that it is caused by the update from us, we'll do our best to fix it as soon as possible. For now, you could choose to either roll back the update or wait for the upcoming Windows
 update. If you choose to keep the current update on your PC and wait for the next update, then here are some other recommendations to speed up your PC:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>R</strong><strong>estart your PC or shut it down when not in use<br />
</strong>
<ul>
<li>Restarting or shutting down your PC clears out the memory and stops any processes that takes up resources.
</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Run Disk cleanup</strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Regularly cleaning up your disk will improve Windows performance significantly. To run the<strong> Disk cleanup tool
</strong>for Windows 10, kindly refer to this <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026616/windows-disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></span></span></strong>.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Run SFC scan<br />
</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. To do so, follow these steps:</span>

<p>r reply Allan and nice to see that at last somebody in Microsoft has sort of admitted the problem - I think we all had an inkling that it was MS attempt to stop Meltdown and Spectre and yes I agree that it is&nbsp;"nice to prevent something bad from happening"
 but obviously it all went wrong and surely it would have been better for the attitude&nbsp; of all of us out here to Microsoft if somebody had just said, yes we have a problem and we will fix it ASAP. - Am sure you know that no matter what the "company Policy"
 told you guys to say there were probably thousands of us who new there was a problem and normal " housekeeping" we regularly do anyway wasn't going to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have in fact not been shutting down at night but rather just putting it to sleep rather than having to go through the extremely slow start up next morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I will stick with the current update and anxiously await the next one now I have a hope for a fix soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that aside, thank you for your attention and yes I will do that SFC thing as well - Have never done that before - Regards</p>

<h2>            Keyboard not being recognized on Surface RT</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The Surface seems to be working jsut fine, but my keyboards are not being recognized by the Surface. Neither the touch cover that came with the device nor the type cover that I purchased as an accessory.</p>
<p>They worked once after a fresh reboot, but never after the machine was suspended/sleeping, and now not even after a fresh reboot.</p>
<p>Do I need to swap the computer part out?</p>
<p>Urgent, please.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Owen, I would first try checking the magnetic area where the keyboard meets the Surface, possibly blowing lightly or wiping it off with an electronics safe wipe, and seeing if that fixes this issue. The magnets on the Surface are actually quite strong
 and can possible pick up metallic particulates from the air. I hope this helps, please let me know how this goes!

I am having the same problem, my wife too on her own machine. We both use Thunderbird and Windows 7 and use the right click, send to mail recipient. No new email with the files attached opens (it used to until 28th Feb2019). We too had the error message in
 a small window that popped up.<br />

    <title>BLUETOOTH HARDWARE ISSUE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennibrookes  say:</h3>
<h2>            BLUETOOTH HARDWARE ISSUE</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure whether it was a crash due to the most recent windows update but I use to be able to use bluetooth on my HP laptop, and now it says my laptop is not compatible with Bluetooth. I have tried to troubleshoot it all different ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Device Manager:<br />
</p>
<p>As you can see from the above, all grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then trying to find the "On" and "Off" button in "Bluetooth &amp; Other Devices":<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>As you can see from the above, no button can be found to turn bluetooth on or off...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also looked in my task bar &amp; Notification bar:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the above, no bluetooth icon anywhere...<br />
<br />
I have also updated the Intel (R) Wireless Bluetooth adapter on the Intel (R) website to no avail.
<br />
Can this problem be rectified, or do I now have to go an purchase a bluetooth dongle?</p>

<p>I have tried all the relevant standard troubleshooting steps shown in the link you provided, not only does none of it work. I had follow the very last step to uninstall driver and re-install an updated driver from the HP website and restarted my computer,
 but now the driver doesn't appear at all in device manager even when i click on "show hidden devices"...<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried 2 different bluetooth drivers from the HP website:<br />
</p>
<p>And I also tried re-installed the intel (R) Wireless Bluetooth adapter again, but as you can see from the below picture, nothing there...<br />
</p>
<p>I haven't installed anything new or deleted anything in the last couple of months, so I don't know what is going on....</p>

            Next, I would recommend a reinstall upgrade of Windows 10. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />It is the KB 4074588 update which is causing it, it has also affected USB devices amongst other problems. Uninstall it then restart the pc.
<br />You could also try restarting the pc to see if BT returns as well as updating the chipset driver from the manufacturer’s website. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t work try these: 
<br />1) Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. 
<br />On Cortana's search box, type, "Troubleshooting" &gt; left-click on the result &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; open Hardware and Devices and follow the on-screen instructions. 
<br />2) Restart Bluetooth Support Service. 
<br />Press the Windows key + R, then type "services.msc". Once the Services window opens, locate Restart Bluetooth Support Service &gt; right-click &gt; Restart. 
<br />After so, right-click on it again, choose Properties, then ensure startup type is on Automatic. 
<br />Once done, please restart your computer and see if the wireless keyboard and mouse are functioning.

 I search for new/updated driver, it tells me the driver is up to date and functioning.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I get the DVD/CD player going again?&nbsp; My HP laptop is about a month old.&nbsp; Thanks.

    <title>Start up repair loop after windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valerie_963  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start up repair loop after windows update</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Start up repair loop, virus undetectable, at a loss of what to do</p>
<p>On the eve of my warranty expiration, my HP Pavilion dv5 somehow contracted something.&nbsp; I attempted to start it up on Saturday morning, and began hitting a start-up repair loop that I could not escape.&nbsp; I was then able to sometimes select the option of starting
 windows normally.&nbsp; When I did this, it was clear that my computer was infected with a virus.&nbsp; I have McAfee, and run scans regularly, but whatever is wrong is undetectable by McAfee.&nbsp; When I can start up, the computer runs very slowly and is often unable to
 establish a connection with any websites.&nbsp; Sometimes I am able to establish a connection, but then when I try to type in a web address it will redirect me to a spam site or a site that will not load that has a long address that begins with "lacky" or something
 like that.<br />
<br />
On Sunday, I did a factory reset on the computer.&nbsp; This did nothing.&nbsp; What was happening continues to happen.<br />
<br />
I just ran a variety of diagnostic tests after pressing "esc" on startup, and everything tested perfectly.&nbsp; However, when the computer shut down again, it started up and began "Applying updates."&nbsp; Then it took me to start up repair, and no matter what I choose
 now, I am unable to start the computer normally -- I am stuck in a start up repair loop.
<br />
<br />
I have searched google for "Start up repair virus" and other terms and have found that many Windows 7 users have the same problem, but I have yet to find a single post where this issue has been resolved.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?&nbsp; I am currently using an old MacBook so that I can search the internet for a solution to my problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone who can offer help!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>As the system is not booting normally, I would suggest you to boot the system in Last know Good Configuration and check if that helps you to boot in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link provided below to boot the system in Last known Good Configuration.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Using Last Known Good Configuration</b></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-Last-Known-Good-Configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-Last-Known-Good-Configuration</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your system does not boot in normal mode using Last Known Good Configuration you may try to boot the system in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Check the link provided below to boot your system in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Start your computer in safe mode</b></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may check if the Windows Update were successfully installed on t he system or not.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link provided below to check the Windows Update history.</span></p>
<p><span><b>See which Windows updates are installed</b></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you boot into safe mode or normal mode you may follow the methods provided below.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Method 1:</b></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run a full scan on your system using
<b>Microsoft Safety scanner</b> and check if the system is affected by any virus/malware.</span></p>
<p><span>To download Microsoft Safety Scanner check the link provided below.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span><b>Note:
</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety
 Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Method 2:</b></span></p>
<p><span>As you have mentioned the system has startup issues and it runs slow at the startup you may perform clean boot to resolve such issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact
 the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype versions</h2>
                    <p>I like Skype 7.40. I cannot stand the 8.x version. How can I get rid of the 8.x version?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Én nagyon kedvelem a Skype 7.40 verziót. Nagyon értelmes, jól kezelhető és átlátható változat. Nagyon bosszant, hogy egy 8-as verzió akaratomon kívül állandóan betolakszik és belép egy 7.40 változás helyéren. Nem szeretem a 8-as verziót! Hogyan szabadulhatok
 tőle?</p>

            There is no version of Skype or Microsoft product that force updates the desktop version of Skype 7.x to&nbsp; Skype 8.x. If it is reappearing on your computer after a few hours, then you have 3rd party software installed doing this.&nbsp; You will need to disable
 that feature, to resolve the problem. Check your antivirus software, some of them have a system-wide software updater component.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> cristina cristina  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows key recovery after pc full format</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>How can I recover my old pc windows 8 installation key after I made full format hard disk of my pc?</p>
<p>If the key can not be found anymore, is it possible to receive a free recovery windows 8 download for Compaq CQ 58 SG250?</p>
<p>When my PC was new, I tried to create 2 partitions. Afterwards, no windows was booting ,so I made full format of complete hard disk ( inklusiv recovery partition).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Cris</p>

            If Windows 8 originally came preinstalled, here is how to recover the key:
<br />
<br />Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 came preinstalled on my computer, how do I find the product key?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Command Prompt (admin)
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt phone activation:

<h2>            The Self Preservation Society - clan and comunity for mature laid back gamers</h2>
                    
<p>we are a mixed bag of moving targets with a wide age range from all corners of the UK.<br />
We aren't looking for uber hardcore mental heads that breathe like Darth Vader as we are a laid back clan where winning comes a usual second to having a laff !<br />
Some fueled by alcohol, some by caffeine and maybe some high on them refresher sweets !!<br />
<br />
We try to play a wide variety of games , from FPS to Racers to Sports titles to Card games on the Arcade. If it has a semi-decent multiplayer chances are most of us will have it.<br />
<br />
We don't take our clan matches too seriously, although it is nice to win now and again. We don't recruit members judged on their skill more on how we all get along in a game .<br />
Possible new members must be mature and aged <b>18</b> or above.<br />
<br />
Pop a post on here if you want to fill up your friends list with well adjusted grown ups or if you fancy getting involved in games with a bit more of a competitive edge against some of the other communities and clans that float about these forums.<br />
Or if you're in another friendly non-uber death machine clan and fancy a fight/race/drunken laugh on some game or other get in touch.</p>
