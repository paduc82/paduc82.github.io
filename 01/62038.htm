<h2>            KB4016240...Won&#39;t install on Windows 10 Tablet</h2>
                    <p>All my computers use WIndows 10 32-bit home or pro. (I updated all to Creators Edition).</p>
<p>Eight of my nine computers installed KB 4016240 without any problems</p>
<p>However my one Windows 10 Tablet (RCA Cambio) will not finish the installation</p>
<p>of this update. It is currently on version 15063.183.</p>
<p>The installation tries to install and tells me it needs a reboot to finish...</p>
<p>On reboot it says it's working and then all of a sudden it goes to the login screen.</p>
<p>I have tried both the Windows Update installation as well as the stand-alone installation</p>
<p>from the MS Catalog. Both do the same thing....Will not finish the installation. I have</p>
<p>run the Update Troubleshooter and it fixed a few registry errors but the installation still</p>
<p>will not complete. I reran the Creators Edition Upgrade over top the current installation</p>
<p>to see if that would solve the problem. That put the computer back to 15063.11 and then</p>
<p>I attempted to install KB4016240 again but again it would not complete the installation.</p>
<p>I restored an image to put the Tablet back on 15063.183. So as it is now this Windows 10
</p>
<p>tablet cannot install KB4016240. This update may not be able to install on this platform.</p>

            <p>Sorry about your problem but glad to read this because a similar thing happened with me. Only got two devices, the laptop updated with no problem but desktop PC running exactly the same version of windows did not. Both have the same antivirus and most other
 apps as well.</p>
<p>Many attempts resulted in the message "not all of the update installed" eventually I started a chat session with MS help. They took remote control and after many tries to correct the problem they said some files were corrupt and I had to reinstall Windows
 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has taken over three hours! However it has worked but I still had to get the update and install it again, this time it has worked correctly and I am on 15063-250 at last.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No real explanation how the corruption occurred, but this worked for me.</p>

            <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
A possible reason why the update failed to install is incompatibility and corrupted files. We suggest running the Microsoft easy fix solution for

            <p>Elmer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the fix from the link as you said (rather than from within the Windows 10 TROUBLESHOOT Panel like I previously did...</p>
<p>The FIX Found </p>
<p>SERVICE INFORMATION WAS CORRUPTED AND FIXED</p>
<p>PENDING UPDATES WAS FIXED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted and ran the Window Update again...</p>
<p>It took a few minutes and then reported MY DEVICE IS UP TO DATE...</p>
<p>Reran it and again Windows Update reports MY DEVICE IS UP TO DATE...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version (Winver.exe) is sill showing 15063.138</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said the KB4016240 update may not be appropriate for this </p>
<p>small Windows 10 tablet and now updates is saying I am up to date...</p>
<p>I am going to leave it as it is for now. Thanks.</p>

            <p>My desktop also said it was up to date after my failed attempts but is o.k. now after the process that I described previously. So if the tablet has received previous updates with no problems I think the problem lies with MS update even if your other devices,
 like my laptop ran it at first try.</p>

            <p>So again today...There were two MSOffice Patches...VBE and Outlook...</p>
<p>The Tablet did not pickup either of these...Said Device Up to date...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I tried running an sfc scannow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but it came up with no integrity violations...That's usual...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I ran a DISM restore health command. &nbsp; DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>it ran and got to 98.4% and then ended saying it couldn't find the required files to reinstall missing...</p>
<p>Well I thought this comes from MS so maybe they don't have everything up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed in the DISM Log that it had looked like it reset some stuff...</p>
<p>I rebooted and ran the&nbsp; Windows Update again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time it picked up the MSOffice Updates as well as KB4016240...</p>
<p>It installed and told me to reboot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unforunately it did the same thing...It appears to try to install KB4016240 but then it goes</p>
<p>to my login screen (Like the upgrade is being interrupted by the login)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that the two MS Office updates which had not been detected prior to the DISM command</p>
<p>were both installed and showed up in Updates history...So at least I've unstuck the Windows Update..</p>
<p>If I can just figure out why KB4016240 is not getting a chance to finish it's installation on reboot...</p>
<p>Like I said it appears as if the login screen might be interrupting it...However I tried removing the login</p>
<p>screen requirement previously (netplwiz) but that did not fix it...Running the standalone installer for KB4016240</p>
<p>also does not fix the issue...</p>

<h2>            Upgrading to Windows 10 error</h2>
                    <p>At this point in time I am running Windows 7 Professional N 64 bit. Since Windows 10 came out I was trying to upgrade. &nbsp;I followed the steps and tried to download all the latest updates for win7. When I tried this ,I got an error 80070002.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking on-line I found people that encountered the same error and they solved this vie deleting files inside &nbsp;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore and starting and stopping the Windows updates serves &nbsp;. This did not resolve my problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also download auto fix from&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/gp/windows-update-issues/en-gb which did not give me any useful information or fix the problem. All its said was "Windows Update error 0x9024402C(2015-09-26-T-03_35_16P) was not fixed.</p>

<p>Hi Scott Smith Sr,</p>
<p>How long has this problem been happening, and when it did last work (beside the purchase of a subscription) how manyy marketplace items did you buy in one day using your card? The reason I say that is because I had a similar problem to me once, and was told
 by Microsoft Support that security measure kicked in through mass purchases.</p>
<p>The best thing you could possibly do right now is speak to them thorugh Support Chat at:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>Explain to them the problem, and one way or another they will get your problem sorted. They MAY have to escalate the issue to higher support but it may not have to come to that.</p>
<p>Please keep me updated on the outcome of your problem when you've had a chat with the Support Team.</p>
<p>*Note: Please do not share any sensitive information in your reply after speaking to the Agents.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<h2>            Windows keeps turning off the security center.</h2>
                    <p>I have been facing same problem from last 3 days. On the start up windows ask to choose an app to open '.tmp' file.</p>
<p>The security center also keeps itself turning off. I tried many times by enabling it through Running 'services.msc' but after some time the same problem rises again.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>

            <p>Hi Maninder,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Windows key + R and&nbsp;type Services.msc then hit enter.</li><li>Services Console will appear.</li><li>Find <strong>Security Center</strong> Service on the right details pane &gt; right click it choose properties &gt;</li><li>Security Center Properties should appear &gt; on the General Tab </li></ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set start-up type to automatic (Delayed start)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On service Status Stop and then Start.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this does not works &amp; error still continues then there are more chances that your system is infected
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status of the issue in regards with Security Center. Your reply is important to assist you further.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Application Compatibility Toolkit Forcing 32-bit colour mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I am attempting to create a shim using ACT for Age of Empires 2 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a well known issue with certain older Dell laptops and this game causing a hard lock. &nbsp;Apparently the fix is to force 32-bit colour mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know which compatibility fix in ACT will allow me to achieve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ForceDirectDrawEmulation was my first guess, however the crashes persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Usually compatibility settings will be most useful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Right click on the shortcut or app executable file (use the shortcut...it is a ton easier).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click on "Properties"</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Go to the "Compatibility" tab and you will see a few options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most useful options for AoE II's ACT is to make sure that the "Override high DPI settings" (or in the case of the Windows Creators Edition update, "Override high DPI scaling behavior.") box is checked (For Windows 10 Creators Edition Update, make sure
 "Scaling is performed by:" "Application" is selected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also notice a check box with "Reduced color mode" with a context menu below it.&nbsp; Check that box as well and in your case you will want to select "16-bit (65536) color".</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What happens when you access System Properties? What do you see for Installed&nbsp;Memory(RAM) and Processor?
</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like (Installed Memory) RAM is not getting detected in System Properties.&nbsp;Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform the steps provided here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may access System Information&nbsp;and check if you are able to&nbsp;find installed&nbsp;memory and processor information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R.</strong></p>
<p>b. Type '<strong>msinfo32</strong>' and hit <strong>ENTER</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>c. On <strong>'System Summary</strong>" tab, find various system informations. Check the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to find the information from System Summary, you may check the services.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R.</strong> </p>
<p>b. Type <strong>'services.msc'</strong> and hit <strong>ENTER</strong>. </p>
<p>c. Please check in Services whether the <strong>Windows Management Instrumentation</strong> service is enabled and set for starting automatically. In case it's disabled, just
<strong>restart</strong> it.<br />
d. Check with the issue now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Provide more information so that we could help you further.

<p>This started back in May and happened infrequently, but in October it started to increase&nbsp; in frequency and happens weekly now and on a regular timeframe (anywhere from 18:22h to 18:59h when VSC kicks in).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of this?&nbsp; Any thoughts on how to better track down what VSC is doing, or why BizTalk reacts&nbsp; this way, when it was fine before?&nbsp; I will say that we have applied&nbsp;nearly all, if not all, security patches from MS&nbsp;that Altiris has determined
 were needed for these servers (I see the latest was 28Feb10), probably due to the fact that it is SP1 and not SP2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!!!</p>

    <title>Madcatz RAT TE drivers viewed as malicious&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Madcatz RAT TE drivers viewed as malicious&#33;</h2>
                    <p>EDIT: (After messing around, I saw that the PC could not recognize the digital signature of the drives. You can disable the need to verify the signatures by Restarting the computer while holding shift. Then from there, restart the computer and press F7 (disable
 driver signature verification) and that's it! Now you just need to watch out for what you install, since Windows will no longer do that for you. Problem solved... sorta)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi! I had RAT TE drivers on my PC. When resetting my pc, they disappeared (this is normal). I installed the newest ones from the website, and they are now not working (drivers install and make the mouse freeze). Checking their properties on Device Manager,
 it says that they are viewed as malicious. It cannot be my PC, since all other drivers are working just fine. Can someone give the download for a working version of the drivers?</p>
<p>If not, can someone provide any other form of assistance?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, as well as updating them. No luck.</p>
<p>There were older versions of the drivers I once had, but the drivers (after being updated on manufacturer website) no longer work!</p>

            Since the drivers are all up to date, this may be an issue with the hardware itself. We suggest that you reach out to your original equipment manufacturer and send a feedback about this matter.<br />

            The drivers are viewed&nbsp;as malicious when installed: the hardware works just fine with generic mouse drivers. Plus, the company is going through some tough times, and no longer has some support for customers.

    <title>Result of resetting Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Result of resetting Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>3 months ago, I've upgraded my Laptop to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 (preloaded by default). Now (after 3 months), if I want to 'Reset' my system, what will be the result ? Will it move back to 8.1 again or will it be remaining the same with windows 10 ?
 Please, assure me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Depends on you. If you get a screen like this after a reset:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fqph.ec.quoracdn.net%2fmain-qimg-7cea26a78cd8a5c6475e1d7c9533b77d%3fconvert_to_webp%3dtrue" /></p>
<p>the third option would put your system back to OEM aka 8.1. In many cases, the reset image might point to the OEM media as well, so the first option can also put you to 8.1 but the chances are very less(quite not sure).</p>
<p>In any case, you can upgrade your system to 10 if you are put back on 8.1 as well.</p>
<p>Also, a clean Install is far superior than this built in reset, so If you have a 10 media, I would strongly suggest a clean Install.</p>

            <p>There is another option where you can do an in-place upgrade.&nbsp; If you have the latest version of Win 10 you can start the upgrade from within Windows and it will do as the Win 7 versions did.&nbsp; This is the only way to keep your installed programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may get a popup asking if you want to continue with the upgrade or do a clean install so select the Upgrade version.&nbsp; Make sure the option is to keep all your personal files.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you look at the options for that you will see an extra option which
 is not available with a Reset.</p>

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed windows 10 a month ago and it's been more or less fine so far, however I tried to install an update for AVG the other day, and it kept telling me that it couldn't do the update because there is an installation in progress. I also get the same
 issues when trying to install windows 10 updates, and I presume it won't work for anything else either. I can't find anything about this issue online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi,<br />
<br />
To isolate the cause of this issue, we recommend that you do the following troubleshooting below:<br />
<br />
1. Ensure you have installed the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker: <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker</a>. </p>
<p>Note: The current 2011 version: 15.4.3555.308<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;Try making movies of a shorter duration - If you have a large movie project, splitting the video into smaller projects may help.<br />
<br />
3. Check that the files you are using are of a supported format – Some file formats are not supported by Windows Live Movie Maker. A list of supported formats can be found here:
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq</a><br />
<br />
4. Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files - Audio and Video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.
</p>
<p>- Try running the Microsoft FixIt tool for codecs: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/</a></p>
<p>- Media info will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether it’s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at&nbsp;
<a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en</a></p>
<p>Note: If can't find the codec you need you may convert the video to a supported format (eg. wmv) and then add it to your Windows Live Movie Maker project.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date - Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.<br />
<br />
To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):<br />
<br />

1. Click on Start button and type “dxdiag” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.

            Hi Rafa.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There were serous problems with recent graphics driver updates so I'd check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates to see if you had a driver delivered and if so try uninstalling it.  (This may be another driver besides Display so report back any that were recently installed.)  
<br />
<br /> Then download and install the Hide Updates utilitiy to check for Updates and if it is offered, Hide it:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work then  Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update.  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />Next try rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If you find driver or other Updates that are causing problems you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Many thanks. I finally found and changed the product code as suggested. The system still will not activate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message states that this is running Win. 10 Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a file on the hard drive marked $Windows.~BT, and another marked Windows. Old&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one marked with the $ contains files such as NewOS and SafeOS.</p>
<p>The other has files in a folder marked WinSxS, most of them are empty.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I can identify the old OS as I see nothing in the properties or names to suggest the system it had.</p>
<p>All I want is the standard Win 10 home edition. Or really almost any system that will run reliably.</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>

</p><p>How did you find the Product Key?&nbsp; Was it for Windows 7 or 8 Home or Pro? </p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the key for Windows 7 it would be on a COA sticker affixed to laptop bottom or under battery.&nbsp; For Windows 8/8.1 you can read the embedded Product Key by installing
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ProduKey</a> to find the BIOS-OEM key only - not the WIndows 10 key which is a generic key that will not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find these keys and they will not activate, it should tell you that's because they are for a wrong version.&nbsp; But if you already know they were for Home version and the owner installed Pro, then you can
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10</a> Home and it should activate with the key or previous Digital License if 10 Home was every activated before.&nbsp; Follow the link closely to&nbsp; delete all partitions down to Unallocated space to get it Cleanest, and all other steps so
 you'll have the very best install possible, better than you could pay for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would do this soon however because the feature to activate using the old OS Product Key is only being left on as a courtesy and could be shut off at any time.&nbsp; You may still be issued an Exception from MS Support via the Contact Support app in Start Menu,
 however, given the circumstances you suffer.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>The key I finally found was in the settings files as suggested in one of the previous posts.</p>
<p>There are no stickers anywhere on the computer. Inside or out.</p>
<p>There are no files on the hard drive that suggest what the previous system was.</p>
<p>Microsoft homepage suggests that the computer may not be able to run the Pro version hence the problems.</p>
<p>Following the suggestions so far got me to a page that allowed me to download the media files that should have installed Windows 10. The installer opened and I followed the path to install the Windows 10 program.</p>
<p>Everything went well until the first time the computer did a re-start and then it locked up. For the last half hour the screen has shown nothing but the HP logo and there is no sign of life anywhere. No flickering of the logo or twinkling of the C drive
 light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero, zip, nada.</p>
<p>I will let it set until later and then look for a pulse.</p>

If there is no Windows 7 COA sticker then you were told to run <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ProduKey</a> to look for a "BIOS-OEM key" only (not the WIndows 10 key, it will not work to activate).&nbsp; If that key is there then you can

Clean Install Windows 10</a> &nbsp; Home and try to activate afterwards with that BIOS-OEM key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no such key then you will have to buy Windows 10 to get a Product Key.&nbsp;

Windows 10 Specs</a> to make sure the PC meets the minimum requirements to run WIndows 10 since you describe it as "damaged."</p>

            <p>After several days of trying I have given up. Whoever wiped the hard drive removed any keys on it and they removed every sticker anywhere on the machine. It isn't worth the cost to buy a system so I took it back and got my money back.</p>

<br />IMO, the conversion isn't possible. You need to buy new genuine license from Microsoft Store online or offline.

<p>So you buy a Version of windows that matches the version installed (other than being a volume license) I assume it is Win Pro since there would be no Volume licensing&nbsp;of Win10 Home, so Home will not be a viable option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to install the new windows version. Just go to the Windows button (lower left side of desktop). Go to Settings (the gear looking symbol and click it). Towards the bottom of the right side pane, you will find the Windows specifications&nbsp;area.
 Click on Change product key or upgrade your edition of Windows. Click on Change product key.</p>
<p>Enter your product key and click next. I don't want to change mine so I don't know what the next screen will say, but when finished you will no longer have a volume license.</p>

<p>If the OP has the Pro version installed, using a legitimate Pro product key will preserve everything.&nbsp; Not so if an Enterprise version is installed.&nbsp; That will require a clean install of Home or Pro.</p>

            Mine is a pro version. I found out that Pro costs $199 and home is around $120. Can I use a home license instead of a pro? And also can you explain the difference between buying windows and buying a product key. From where should I purchase the product
 key?

<p>You can use the Home version, but it would require a clean install--everything would be wiped.&nbsp; Legitimate Windows licenses are never sold without installation media unless purchased from the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; If you buy just a key, it won't be genuine and
 you'll find yourself in the same situation you're in now.&nbsp; You might be able to find an OEM version that's less expensive than the retail version, but be careful where you buy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            running outlook as a standard user</h2>
                    I have multiple users on PC.<br />
If a standard user runs Outlook or Filemaker Pro and other programs W7 keeps asking for an admin PW each time it is started.<br />
<br />
There is a problem with requiring this and I need to know how to open these programs as a standard user without having to input an admin pw<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community and thanks for posting the question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As per the description provided, you are having issues with receiving a prompt for password and username when accessing outlook or Filemaker Pro from Standard account.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you the administrator of this computer?</p>
<p>2. Is the prompt for a username and password?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drag the slider for the User Account Control to Never Notify from the administrator account.

            I am an admin<br />
it prompts for any admin p/w, listing the admins to select from.<br />
<br />
I am confused.<br />
If I go to make changes to a std user UAC it says that I must be logged on as admin to do that.<br />
If I log on as admin the only UAC I can change is that admin acct.<br />
The other user accts do not show that option.<br />
Setting the admin acct has no effect on the other users. So... is something broken??????????<br />
<br />
Once installed, a program that modifies the system should not require an admin pw to run from a std user account. Something must be set wrong.<br />
<br />
Does it have anything to do with which acct it was originally installed from?<br />
IE, installed by a logged on admin vs installed by a std user entering an admin pw.<br />
<br />
There appears to be a number of ppl having issues with this operation.<br />

            It is Office 7 or 10. But it isn't only office that is effected. Also filemaker and many others so it isn't related to the program except that the program must want to make changes to the system.<br />
<br />
If I chg the acct to admin, I get a PU but it doesn't require a pw to dismiss.<br />
<br />
If I installed from a std acct what would be the result re permissions????????????<br />
<br />
Should it require permission from that account??????????????<br />

            What r u saying?<br />
If I run a program that changes registry settings I must run it as an admin to keep from having to enter an admin password to start it.<br />
That sounds pretty self-defeating...........<br />
Got to say, I think u r wrong. I believe one of my computers does not have that issue.<br />
In fact, I just tried this one and it opens Excel, Word, PP, and Outlook just fine.<br />
This user is std with UAC set at 3 of 4. I can set this one higher but cannot set it lower.<br />
When I changed the admin user lower, I still could not set this one lower -- does it take a reboot??<br />
<br />
The computer I am having an issue with is one that I changed the user from admin to std.<br />
I suspect that should not create that problem.<br />
<br />
But the issue is there none the less.<br />

<p>Your issue appears to be as a result of changing the user accounts permissions.</p>

            OK, what is the difference whether I install the program under the admin acct or just enter the admin PW when I install it -- or vice-versa?<br />
<br />
Why should that cause it to always ask for the admin pw when i open it?<br />
<br />
Seems like the end result should be the same regardless of what acct it is installed under.<br />

                    So i need to do a repair install on Windows Vista Ultimate SP2 and i made a SP2 install disc using the reverse integration method, but when i insert the disc it blocks the upgrade option saying "you cannot upgrade to a lower version of windows" which means
 the installer is not detecting that ive inserted a sp2 install disc, iv'e tested the install disc and it does install windows vista ultimate sp2 also uninstalling SP2 is not an option because iv'e used the compcln.exe tool to make the service pack permanent.
 How can i get it to detect that i have a sp2 install disc?

            <blockquote>So i need to do a repair install on Windows Vista Ultimate SP2 and i made a SP2 install disc using the reverse integration method, but when i insert the disc it blocks the upgrade option saying "you cannot upgrade to a lower
 version of windows" which means the installer is not detecting that ive inserted a sp2 install disc, iv'e tested the install disc and it does install windows vista ultimate sp2 also uninstalling SP2 is not an option because iv'e used the compcln.exe tool to
 make the service pack permanent. How can i get it to detect that i have a sp2 install disc?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that you say you have installed it elsewhere, but&nbsp;this is&nbsp;how you slipstream SP1 and&nbsp;SP2 to the Vista Retail or System Builders OEM disk.</p>

</p><p>There is no Vista SP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before you start Trialling Windows 10, there are System requirements, etc for that Operating System.</p>

            That's the method is used to slipstream sp2 into the install disc.
