<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t allow me to update my graphic drivers.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on the 29th and ran into some issues. &nbsp;First all my files were out of order and settings were reset which was to be expected, but my second monitor went black. &nbsp;So I figured that I had to redo the settings for it, but when I tried
 it wouldn't detect it. &nbsp;So with that I thought well maybe I have to update my graphics card. &nbsp;Which my graphics card did indeed need to be updated but I wasn't able to update it. I tried updating the drivers through the device manager, through the windows
 update, and also downloading the most current driver which is the windows 10 update. None of those options worked for me. &nbsp;I ended up requesting a technician call me and one did several hours later. The lady could not even remotely log into my computer to
 help me with my issue. &nbsp;For some reason I can't download anything either. &nbsp;After being on the phone with her for a couple of hours she said that she would have to escalate my issue and that someone would call me sometime on Friday. &nbsp;That was yesterday and
 no one has called. I was a bit upset but wasn't really bothered with it and was just going to wait a couple of days to see if I get a call back. &nbsp;Waiting wasn't too bad of an option for me at first because I could still get things done regardless of my computer
 being super slow to load and do things. (Oh ya I forgot to mention that right before the lady told me she had to escalate my issue she had me uninstall my graphics drivers....I didn't want to knowing I was having issues downloading it but she assured me she
 would solve my problem....) Anyway now today I have a 3 part test in one of my classes and a huge project in another and I can't download any of the resources I need.....I kept getting notifications saying that the file was corrupt or could not be read. (Same
 message for multiple different documents in different programs). &nbsp;Is anyone having the same issue or know how to fix this? Oh the error message I get when I try to download my graphic driver from the site says that "The extended attributes are inconsistent".
 &nbsp;This is also the same message I got when the technician lady tried to access my computer remotely. &nbsp;The windows update message says&nbsp;Error 0x800f0203.</p>
<p>I was going to do a schedule call but there are only slots for up to a week and there are NO time slots available on any of the days....I can't wait that long to get someone to call me and help me with this issue.</p>
<p>Also if a Microsoft technician is able to look into this issue here is a case number I was given if it helps. Case # 1298296671</p>
<p>Oh and my graphics card is a Radeon HD 7800 series.</p>
<p>I know my post is all over the place and I'm sorry.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Installation issue</h2>
                    <p>I just purchassd GTAIV: The Ballad of&nbsp;Gay Tony on my Xbox one and while under the queue it says "recently installed" i cannot find it under games or apps. Ive spoken with a representative through live chat and they had me troubleshoot my account and that clearly wasn't the problem. Has anyone else had this issue and found a way to fix it? If not is there a possibiloty of a refund or store credit since the game is defective?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Surface Book Keyboard&#47;Base Randomly DIsconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacob1201  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Surface Book Keyboard&#47;Base Randomly DIsconnecting</h2>
                    So I have had this Surface Book (1 TB version) for about 2-3 weeks now and it has treated me well. However, today out of the blue it started randomly disconnecting from the keyboard/base for like a millisecond, and then said it was attached again. It happens
 at the weirdest times, like playing a game or being on the internet occasionally, and I have no clue what is wrong as it does not seem like many people have this issue and/or no issues like this are being asked. I did wipe down the connectors with a microfiber
 wipe and I blew into the holes on the actual Surface to get any dust out, which helped a little bit, but it still randomly disconnects and you never know when it is going to happen again.&nbsp;

            I ran the program and it found nothing wrong with the device at all. It kept doing it today too while I was on Google Slides making a presentation. Only once or twice, but it still happened.&nbsp;

<p>I had this same issue with my own Surface Book, I found cleaning the contacts on the keyboard base to fix it "for a time", eventually I had to just send it in to Microsoft to have them fix it.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Image thumbnail preview not showing on medium-sized icons. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomasbengtsson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Image thumbnail preview not showing on medium-sized icons.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>When I turned on my computer this morning I saw that the thumbnail preview on all my image files had been replaced with the flower icon(Gifs shows up as just white icons).</p>
<p>Now I have attempted the normal method of going to my settings and making sure that it is suppose to show the previews rather then the icons, infact I disabled previews and then turned them back on just to see if that resetted it, it did not.</p>
<p>Also went into sysdm(or whatever it was called) and checked the settings there and it checked out fine, same there I disabled previews and then turned them back on.</p>
<p>I tried restarting my computer but didn't work either.</p>
<p>But I tried changing the size of them and to my surprise, on large icons or small icons, the previews show up but not on medium-sized.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I can't use large icons since they are way too big and small icons are way too small so I would like to use medium-sized icons.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas why this is happening and how to fix it ?</p>

<p>See if clearing the thumbnail cache using Disk Cleanup helps.</p>
<p>Click Start, type Disk Cleanup, and click Disk Cleanup from search results.</p>
<p>In the Disk Cleanup window, deselect everything, except <strong>Thumbnails</strong>.</p>
<p>Click OK.</p>

            Sadly didn't work either, infact doing so removed the thumbnail previews even when looking at large or small icons.

            The caches are here (%LocaAppData%\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer), as you see for each icon size there is a separate .db file. May be we need to give it some time to regenerate after clearing the cache.

            Just go to Windows Live mail. then go to Junk Folder. Now right click on any mail and go to
<b>Properties</b>. You will see the location of that email in the Junk folder. Example this my&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>C:\Users\<b>User account</b>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\<b>It can be&nbsp;different&nbsp;name</b>\Junk email\</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, don't copy another text other than stop by Junk email.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now go to Run by using <b>Windows Key + R.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Paste the location of your Junk email location, then hit Enter. Now you are in that folder, just delete all of email you want.</div>
<div><br />
<div>after you finish, please go back to Windows Live mail again then go to <b>Home
</b>tab. Click on <b>Send/Receive </b>to update or sync your Windows live mail and Hotmail web server.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 AU BSoD error Critical_Process_Died  after Log-in</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 10 AU from Windows 10 v1511, I've been facing constant BSoD on my PC after log-in. At first, I thought this could be me being not installing the latest drivers/day one patches but after installing the latest update
<strong>KB3176929</strong>, the BSoD error &nbsp;became more frequent, so I uninstalled it to gain control of my PC again. I felt bit relived when I learned on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4vufpo/windows_10_fully_freezes_after_anniversary_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reddit</a> that they are many like me facing the issue. Please assist me.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
None of your methods worked for me. I tried everything, clean booted my PC, updated/uninstalled my display and other drivers, safe-booted but still I got the same error code and since Windows has this 10 day period for rolling back to old build, I cannot roll
 back to v1511. I have also installed the latest update&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=824016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB3176495</a>&nbsp;but
 still no win for me. &nbsp;Is there any fix coming in near time? I think the company says they'll make users to love Windows, but I'm not feeling this.&nbsp;

    <title>Screen Turned Red after Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rakeshsolankims  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Turned Red after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 on my VAIO Laptop. Every thing worked good for the same day even after 2 start up on laptop but Today to my surprise&nbsp;when I turned my Laptop&nbsp;ON in the morning my display&nbsp;turned Red right from the start up.
 All items&nbsp;which were Black turned in to Red including Texts also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I thought It may be display setting problem but as I started to apply all the FIXES one by one I found it very severe trouble. I had already checked the following "Supposed Solutions" but that all still could not have solved my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Display Setting ( Contrast, RGB Setting etc. )</p>
<p>2. Theme Setting</p>
<p>3. Device Manager&gt;Display Adapters&gt;Updating Driver/Uninstall Drivers/Scan for Hardware Change etc.</p>
<p>4. Device Manager&gt;Display Adapters&gt;Updating Driver/Uninstall Drivers/Scan for Hardware Change etc.</p>
<p>5. Safe Mode Start Up ( Still Display is Red in Safe Mode Also )</p>
<p>6. Hardware and Devices &gt; Troubleshooting etc.</p>
<p>7. Windows Update</p>
<p>8. Restart my Laptop 10 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this supposed solution have not worked out my problem.</p>
<p>The only solution remained now for me is to "Revert back to Windows 7" but I hope I can found solution before the last fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I request MS team to address my trouble and solve at the earliest please. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Method.1: Removed battery for 5 min and again restarted but it didn't solve</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method.2: Tried to Roll back drivers on Display adapter and Monitor in Device Manager&nbsp;but the Roll back Driver Option is not highlighted in my Properties Windows&nbsp;it get highlighted once&nbsp;we change driver installation.</p>

</strong>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security
<br />
products are&nbsp;just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to <br />
corrupt or go out of bounds.&nbsp;The video driver or something affecting it would <br />
be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by <br />
manually checking&nbsp;at the System maker and device makers' sites.<br />

</p><p>====================================================&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide&nbsp; Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Windows Virtual PC latest version &#63;</h2>
                    <p>How can I tell if I'm using the<strong> latest version</strong> of the Windows
<strong>Virtual PC</strong> ? How can I install the <strong>latest version ?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did download and run<strong> Windows6.1-KB958559-x64-RefreshPkg.msu</strong>, but I notice the my work PC (which just had Virtual PC installed) has features that my prior installation at home does not have (ie there is a drop down menu titled "tools" with
 a selection for "settings").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to be using the current version of Windows Virtual PC. Both computers host Windows 7 x64 (ultimate).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I expect that the Windows XP mode stays current, but if there is something I ought to check with XP mode, I would like to know.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks so much</strong> for any information&nbsp;!</p>

 nur die usk-version aktivieren o.O hat jemand die pegi version in deutschland schon aktiviert und wenn ja wie? wäre sehr hilfreich :D</span></p>

<p>[quote]have following problem: I live in deutschland and want to play with Austrian kumpel saints row 3 coop. cut (usk-) version is already lost, there this became play mutilated up to him goes no more! thus remains to me möglichkeit the uncut (pegi-) version
 from österreich to import. sounds nicely and well, however, with him play is present apparently an on-line-passport which one must activate to play multiplayer and coop. according to some rezensionen with amazon only the usk version can be activated in deutschland
 supra O somebody has already activated pegi version in deutschland and if so like? it would be very helpful[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are asking about the online pass, you can purchase it off the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft points (I tink that's the amount being asked for it) or it should already be included in brand new copies. If the game was bought second hand, they
 the only option is to buy the online pass via the marketplace (or the ingame download menu in the game itself (See the Downloadable Content section on the main menu)). I hope that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>German Translation (Deutsche Übersetzung) :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[quote]Wenn Sie nach dem On-Line-Pass fragen, können Sie es vom Xbox Lebender Marktplatz für 800 Punkte von Microsoft kaufen (ich tink es ist der Betrag, der darum gebeten wird), oder es sollte bereits in die Marke neue Kopien eingeschlossen werden. Wenn
 das Spiel die zweite Hand, sie gekauft wurde, ist die einzige Auswahl, den On-Line-Pass über den Marktplatz zu kaufen (oder das Ingame-Download-Menü im Spiel selbst (Sieh die Herunterladbare Zufriedene Abteilung auf dem Hauptmenü)). Ich hoffe, dass das hilft.[/quote]</p>

<p>Hmmm Deaths Head, i thought u get it wrong.</p>
<p>His problem was, that the german version of SR3 was cut. And he read (had read?) that german coop is not playable together with uncut coop so he wanted to to buy the german uncut version from austria.</p>
<p>Buuuut the online pass which is included must be activated first to play it in coop and at amazon.de reviews he read that an online pass from an uncut version of SR3 couldn't be activated in germany.</p>
<p>It's the same problem with...hmmm...for example Gears of War 2. banned in germany. So you can't activate a download code for Gears 2, play it in multiplayer or download a dlc from germany.</p>
<p>So his question is: is it possible to activate an online pass from an uncut version of SR3 in germany?</p>
<p>Sorry for my english ;)</p>

<p>Yeah, pretty dumb. Same with Quake 4. International uncut versions banned in germany and not compatible with german cut versionsSometimes it sucks to live in germany ;)</p>
<p>Well i'm having the same problem now. I thought about buying the uncut version of SR3 from Austria but wanted to play it in Coop with a friend. She needs the uncut version, too. So does anyone knows, if its possible to activate an uncut online pass in germany
 or would it be a great waste of money?</p>
<p>Couldn't find any clear answer in the internet. :(</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here&nbsp;are the Dell options for you.</p>
<p>"Computer Does Not Boot to Microsoft Windows Vista"</p>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?docid=DSN_343119&amp;isLegacy=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?docid=DSN_343119&amp;isLegacy=true</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the steps using F8 to reinstall.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;docid=DSN_336966&amp;isLegacy=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;docid=DSN_336966&amp;isLegacy=true</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a Startup Repair&nbsp;and / or a&nbsp;System Restore using a Microsoft Vista DVD</p>
<p>Manufacturers Recovery Disks do not normally have Repair Options; thay are normally&nbsp;a reinstall to Factory Settings option&nbsp;only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Overview of the Windows Vista Repair options </li><li>How to perform an automatic repair of Windows Vista using Startup Repair </li><li>Advanced Tools overview </li><li>Conclusion</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have or can not borrow a Microsoft DVD there is&nbsp;a download of a Vista&nbsp;Startup Repair ISO file available&nbsp;which you can make into a Bootable disk to do the above&nbsp;Startup Repair and&nbsp;that&nbsp;method&nbsp;is recommended by a lot of posters in these Forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to buy it.</p>
<p>Here is a link to it:</p>
<p><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2011/windows-recovery-discs-updated-reinstated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2011/windows-recovery-discs-updated-reinstated/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have problems after doing the above:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact&nbsp;Dell and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Do a Clean Install and Setup with a Full Version of Vista"</b></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Update and Edge Cannot Go Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krenshai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update and Edge Cannot Go Online</h2>
                    <p>Was upgraded to Win 10 Successfully from win7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After accidentally linking to my microsoft account (it was suggested) I can no longer do Windows Updates or Go Online using Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender can retrieve its updates.</p>
<p>Firefox, BitTorrent, Chrome all go online successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have unlinked and am on a local account. &nbsp;But still no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Windows 10 Update Troubleshooter (as admin) - it reported that service registration is missing and corrupted - and was fixed. &nbsp;However On Restart the machine -&nbsp;<strong><span>msiserver</span></strong><span> has to be started manually. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(I suspect that this may have been caused by a synching of policies over the internet? but I &nbsp;cannot be sure how that happened).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have spent an entire day hunting solutions -</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>the one offered&nbsp;</span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/windows-update-cannot-connect-to-internet-but/014efc7e-d375-483e-95da-3ae310d0f99b did not change anything - and the Solution to RESET by wipe all
 my apps and personal setting for a fix - is NOT not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I notice the Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center - shows that there are no current connections to the internet which is UNUSUAL - since &nbsp;I am able to connect to the internet using chrome etc. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm on a Verizon Router box ... so I don't see the need to setup a Connection. &nbsp;I am connected by Ethernet.</span></p>
<p>I cannot do any windows updates. &nbsp;As such I cannot Receive the latest update unless I can download it from the internet and then there's no way for me to run the update unless its packaged to run securely on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any Help ...&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1. What type of media are you using to&nbsp;play the file? Does it provide Dolby / DTS audio?</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Setup the speakers to use surround sound - if Windows is set to be in stereo, surround sound won’t be possible.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming that&nbsp;you are playing a DVD, within Media Center, I would suggest you to follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;go to Tasks,
</span></p>
<p><span>b.Settings, DVD, Audio,</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;Uncheck the Auto volume option.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Some third party codecs can cause problems with audio decoding resulting in this problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>After the update to Windows 10 creator, my computer was unstable. &nbsp;It would hang up and sometimes, clicking on links did nothing. &nbsp;The USB ports became erratic and it was very difficult to connect USB devices and have them work properly. &nbsp;Called Microsoft.
 &nbsp;They called my back first time and there was nothing on the line but silence. &nbsp;Tried and again and got put on hold for 15 minutes and then hung up on. &nbsp;Tried to go back to the prior windows update and the whole PC crashed and would reboot. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your response. Since you've already tried the troubleshooting steps above, what we suggest next is to reset your Windows Update components to resolve any errors you are facing while updating Windows. After resetting the Windows Update components,
 reinstall the Creators Update using an installation media (USB flash drive or DVD) and perform a clean installation. Kindly refer to the articles below for more information:</p>

    <title>Video Memory Management Internal BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aria siregar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Memory Management Internal BSOD</h2>
                    <p>I am using Asus X450JF Laptop with Windows 10 Home Single Language (Version 1703 build 15063.726) and activated with digital license linked with my account. Lately I've been experiencing repeatedly BSOD with "Video Memory Management Internal" error message.
 I've figured out from several questions similar to me that this might be caused by uncompatible video drivers. I want to know which version of drivers that compatible for my Laptop since it requires both Intel HD 4600 driver and nVidia GeForce 745M.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really appreciate any help.</p>

            First problem is that when you changed the motherboard you almost certainly eliminated the original Windows license. Sorry.
<br />
<br />The Windows license that came with the computer originally would have been an OEM licesne type.  That cannot be transferred to a new motherboard. 
<br />
<br />So now you have to do a clean install of Windows to the new SSD drive. You will need a new Windows license / product key to activate the installation.

<br />The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
<br />
<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

<p>Thank you for your fast reply!<br />
U're right,I most likeley do need a new license but.....I am afraid that this won't solve my problems.<br />
The "freezing" problems occurred as wel BEFORE the new mainboard,&nbsp; therefor I renewed my computer and so....might there be a hardware problem allthough I renewed almost everything?</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>

            Yes, there still is a (smaller) chance of hardware issues.  But if it is a hardware problem in the remaining "old" parts it will likely be hard to find. Most likely it will require very specific conditions to trigger. 
<br />
<br />I have heard of problems with power supplies that cannot provide enough power.  One very specific example was a multiple video card (monitor) setup. The power supply rating appeared to be large enough. But the user found on doing some in depth research that internally the PSU had a split design that was not able to provide enough power to the video cards.
