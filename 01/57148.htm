<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for being part of the Windows 10 family.</span></p>

<p><span>I understand that you are query about&nbsp;transferring music files from IPod to&nbsp;Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can try to connect the IPod to the Computer with ITunes installed on it. Then you will be able to transfer the files to the Computer through IPod. Or else you can
 try with other third party application which can help you transfer the music files from the IPod library folders.</span></p>

            <p>Hello dbailey41,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went over the dump and found that the stop code is 0x101.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This typically indicates some kind of hardware failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, there was one third party driver in the stack: RT64win7.SYS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This driver has the following properties:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0: kd&gt; lmvm rt64win7<br />
start&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; module name<br />
fffff880`04966000 fffff880`049eb000&nbsp;&nbsp; Rt64win7 T (no symbols)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loaded symbol image file: Rt64win7.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image path: \SystemRoot\system32\DRIVERS\Rt64win7.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image name: Rt64win7.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timestamp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fri Jun 10 01:33:15 2011 (4DF1BAAB)&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- driver is dated from June this year.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RT64Win7/sys is from the Real Tech sound card driver.&nbsp; If updating this driver does not help, then I would further recommend running the hardware diagnostics provided by the computer's manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>

            <p>If you haven't already, just restart your PC. Sometimes a service may not start for some reason and a restart can clear it. Other quick things to check, hover on your speaker icon ( bottom right, near the clock ) and make sure its not muted and the volume
 is turned up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have restarted and it hasn't helped, then look in &lt;control panel&gt; &lt;device manager&gt; to make sure you have a sound card configured and enabled ( probably under 'Sound, video and game controllers' ). If its listed but not enabled, try enabling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your speakers are set as the default sound playback device. Right-Click your speaker icon, click 'playback devices', on the [playback] tab make sure 'Speakers' are set for the default device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all the above seems OK, look in your update history, &lt;control panel&gt; &lt;windows update&gt; &lt;view update history&gt;. Are there any recent updates that claim to be audio drivers? If yes, use Device Manage and roll the driver back, or uninstall that particular
 update and Hide it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the above help, try running the audio troubleshooter. See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>ALL SSD&#39;s and HDD&#39;s not apearing in task manager. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1010790  say:</h3>
<h2>            ALL SSD&#39;s and HDD&#39;s not apearing in task manager.</h2>
                    <p>This is an issue i have had for a long while it comes and go on windows 10 but before i continue here are my computer specifications in case i am ever asked for them later: *No parts are overclocked or changed and everything is default.<br />
<br />
*Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>*AMD 8350 990fx CPU</p>
<p>*R9 290 sapphire Tri-x OC</p>
<p>*16GB(4 Sticks) Hyper-X Dual Channel RAM</p>
<p>*2x240GB SSDs - One of them is the main C drive.</p>
<p>*3 HDD's</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you tell me to yes i have done all the drive checks using CMD though i know I'll be asked to do it again because you should always do the simplest things first. Upon closing CMD when all the drives are still not visible inside of Task Manager task
 manager will crash as the same if im browsing and looking at the drives in the file browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i said i have done everything i could think of over the past months to fix this issue from all kinds of disk checking and restarting and the problem even persists after a full format of ALL of the drives. I have checked and 'legacy' support items in my
 operating system and switched things this way and that to no solving of the issue. Now that i've listed what i tried here is what happening in a list. Yes&nbsp; i have tried booting without the older HDD's. Really old mind you like 2 are 149GB and one is 250GB.
 I tried uninstalling drivers as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1: All drives not appearing in performance tab (or any tab) ofTask Manager.</p>
<p>2: Task manager crashing upon closing if the drives are not in the performance tab.</p>
<p>3: Window becomes unresponsive when closing it upon viewing all connected drives in the file browser.</p>
<p>4: When the issue is present any kind of opening of EXE's on either drives have issues such as opening something as simple as STEAM or Origin. They will either run in the background with almost minimal resources or not at all. (Never Opening)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help i can get as this issue has been present forever. (I thought the issue might have been one of my SSD's being bad but i have since formatted and flip flopped them from being the main and even being in a RAID 0 configuration and the issue
 persists.</p>

            After attempting a clean boot my PC still had the issues i explained in the above post. The next day after undoing the clean boot my computer was back to normal with the drives appearing as they should in task manager and all issues were gone. I am not
 sure what causes this issue at all, i made sure to undo all RAID 0 configurations and settings i changed upon going back to my normal drive storage. It is back to normal but i am sure it will be back again one day. I am sorry for the long time for a reply,
 i don't check my emails often enough. I will try to re-create the drive issue tonight and hopefully this can get narrowed down. If you have any ideas what could cause this issue let me know!

            Hi Sayantan,<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes! You can transfer Full version (Retail) license on another computer and would still be able to get support from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have more questions and we'll answer it for you.

<p><span>Full version (Retail):</span></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>OEM :</span></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What happens if I change my motherboard?</span></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span>OEM license&nbsp;</span>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase
 a full retail Windows 10 license.&nbsp;<span>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><span>b. Stand-alone software.</span>&nbsp;If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you.
 You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the
 software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want transfer rights and be able to make all sorts of hardware modifications, then the retail full license is recommended.</p>

            <p>You should use system images instead </p>
<p>Reflect will prompt you at first start to create the WinPE recovery cd or flash media which is only a 500mb download so a regular cd or small flash drive will work
</p>
<p>I usually create one of each just for good measure ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system image is another story depending on the size of the disk but Reflect does compress the image.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Compaq Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about<br />
known issues (this is the best source of information for a built-in camera).<br />

<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually included<br />
with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers.<br />

<br />
<span>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

                    <p>
</p><p>I'm using Skype for Business on a Mac.</p>
<p>Calling ANY number works only with the number pad.&nbsp; Clicking a link in a meeting description or in the call log does not work at all and always results in...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Obviously, the number is in service since I can call it by tapping the numbers in the dialling&nbsp;pad.</p>

<p>Hello Digitalman42,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the issue only happens when you click a meeting invitation via Outlook for Mac client right? If you are using
<a href="http://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App(OWA)</a>, please also let me know. If you are using Outlook for Mac client, try OWA to see if there is any difference. First please sign out Skype for Business for Mac and click
<strong>Delete sign-in info</strong> at the sign in page. Restart Skype for Business client to see whether it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn‚Äôt work, I want to collect some more information so that we can help you narrow down the issue:
</p>
<p>1. Please check whether any other users in the organization have the same issue?
</p>
<p>2. Please sign in your account on another Mac device to see if the same issue happens.
</p>
<p>3. Please let me know the version number of your Outlook for Mac and Skype for Business for Mac. Open the applications and click Outlook-&gt;About Outlook or Skype for Business-&gt;About Skype for Business.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            InstallShield stops running</h2>
                    Problem installing a new program from CD.&nbsp; Family Tree Maker 2010.&nbsp; <br />
Laptop #1 running Vista Home Premium Service Pk1 loads and runs the new Family Tree Maker 2010 just fine.<br />
Laptop #2 running Vista Home Premium Service Pk1 will not install the program from the CD, the InstallShield just stop running.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Adminstrator priviliges I can either let Autorun launch the Setup.exe program or I can navigate to the CD with windows explorer and manually launch Setup.exe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install shield wizard launches and tells me "Family Tree Maker 2010 setup is preparing the InstallShield wizard... (or something like that)&nbsp; Please wait."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about two passes of the progress bar, the InstallShield Wizard window closes, and the Family Tree Maker 2010 Installation Wizard appears very briefly on the task bar.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After only 2 seconds or so the Family Tree Maker 2010 Installation Wizard closes (disappears from the Task Bar) and nothing else happens.&nbsp; No errors, no nothing.<br />
<br />
I've copied the CD contents to a temp folder on the hard drive of Laptop #2, then executed setup.exe as Administrator from the temp folder on the hard drive.&nbsp; Same results.
<br />
I've compared running processes between the two laptops and stopped the processes that are running on bad laptop #2 that were not running on good laptop #1.<br />
<br />
Laptop #1:&nbsp; Dell Inspiron 1525, Intel Core 2 Duo CPU T8300 @ 2.40 GHz, 4.00 GB RAM, Mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset Family<br />
Laptop #2:&nbsp; Dell Studio 1535, Intel Core 2 Duo CPU T5750 @ 2.00 GHz, 4.00 GB RAM, 32-bit Operating System.<br />

<h2>            Windows keeps downloading KB2871997 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi. My Windows 7 PC has downloaded KB2871997 more than 50 times since mid August. 'Installed updates' says the installation was 'Successful' each time but the update does NOT appear in 'Update History' and, as soon as the update has finished 'installing',
 it is redownloaded as a new update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can 'hide' the update but I don't want to miss out on security updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse, there seem to other updates that are listed in 'installed updates' as 'Failed (KB2918614, KB2976897, KB2978668, KB2982791, KB2980245, KB2981580, KB2952664). And Internet Explorer 11 for 64 bit systems has failed to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an HP Pavilion, bought in 2011 (p6-2060uk) with Windows 7 64 bit (now SP1) installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Norton Internet Security (version 21.0.6.32), Advanced System Care (v 7.4 Free ) which is run every few days (includes a 'Registry Defrag' and 'Registry Fix')</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe Flash and Java up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone figure this out! Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your question is a bit difficult to interpet but I'm going to outline what I think is your scenario and then how to solve it. If my interpretation is incorrect then please correct me and I will try again.</p>
<p>I suspect that what you want to do is connect to a work PC using remote desktop from your home PC. Then you want to be able to print to the printer attached to your home PC from within the remote desktop connection, i.e. send a print job from your work PC
 to your home PC's printer.</p>
<p>To achieve this probably all you have to do is install the driver for your home PC's printer on your work PC. Go through the driver installation as if that printer is connected to the work PC (even though it isn't). If you get asked to attach the printer,
 ignore this and tell the driver installation "I will attach later" or possibly manually specify a printer port such as lpt3.</p>
<p>If the driver installation cannot be forced through to completion without attaching the printer then you will have to take your printer to the work PC to install the driver. Once the driver is installed you can take the printer home again.</p>
<p>The next time that you connect with remote desktop, the Work PC should show your home PCs printer in the Printers folder and it should be selectable for output anywhere that you can print.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to the internet using Broadcom Netlink&#40;TM&#41; Gigabit Ethernet Adapter Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I updated Broadcom Netlink(TM) Gigabit Ethernet Driver to 15.6.0.14 through an auto update from Windows Update on my Windows 10, I am unable to connect to the Internet through my Ethernet wired adapter.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Here are the specs of my PC:<br />
<br />
Lenovo&nbsp;<br />
Ideapad Y570<br />
8 GB RAM<br />
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.20GHz 2.2 GHz<br />
64 bit operating system<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried the following things before posting this query but its still not working:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually downloaded the latest driver from Broadcom.com (https://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet-nic-netlink-57xx) and update existing driver ( while installing, I get an error message in the end "Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software
 for your device. The operation timed out" . I disabled my digital device certificate, still I am getting this error. Not sure why?)</li><li>Downgrading the driver to an older version (While installing the older version, I am getting the same error as mentioned above)</li><li>Upgrade to a different version of Ethernet Driver (17.2.0.2) as it was mentioned in one of the community post</li><li>Uninstalling the driver and reinstalling the latest one manually (When I uninstall, the Ethernet Adapter in my network settings also gets uninstalled and I am unable to restore it back without a system restore option).</li><li>Manually changed the Receiver Side Scaling as Disabled</li><li>When I run diagnostics it tells me it says there might be a problem with the drivers but provides no fix.</li><li>Tried connecting through different Ethernet cables</li><li>Checked with a professional techie guy but no luck</li></ul>
<p>The funny thing is the Ethernet Adapter is always showing as disabled and whenever I click on Enable button on my Ethernet Adapter in Network Connections, it gives me a message "Enabled" but still shows it as disabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the device manager for the device shows that the "Device is working properly" and on clicking update the latest driver, it gives the message " The best driver software is already installed"<br />
<br />
WiFi is working fine.<br />
<br />
I have read a lot of issues faced by others since the recent update but even after trying all those fixes, I am unable to start internet through my wired ethernet port. Some of the post I have gone through include:<br />

<br />
I am guessing this is a Windows 10 issue as my Ethernet port was working perfectly fine before the update. I cannot revert back to Windows 7 as well as its been more than 2 months since I have upgraded to Windows 10.<br />
<br />
My broadcom ethernet driver device ID PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_16B1 and associated Broadcom part numbers is BCM57781<br />
<br />
Please help as I use wired ethernet adapter to access internet most of the times and its really annoying not able to use the same.<br />

            This has been widespread recently and is apparently related <br />
to McAfee. Editing causes photos to become hidden.<br />
<br />
The files are not missing...they are hidden.&nbsp; Try changing the <br />
following setting and the photos should re-appear.<br />
<br />
Windows XP - Show Hidden Files<br />
<br />
Go to...Control Panel / Folder Options / View tab.<br />
Tick..."Show Hidden Files and Folders" / Apply / OK.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista - Show hidden Files<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Show-hidden-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Show-hidden-files</a><br />
<br />
Windows 7 - Show hidden files<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files</a><br />
<br />
When the photo thumbs reappear...they may look washed out...<br />
to clear that up...right click one photo or a selected group or a <br />
folder and choose...Properties...uncheck the box....."Hidden" / <br />
Apply / OK.<br />
<br />
The following link may shed some light:<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Keyboard and Type cover is crashing regularly</h2>
                    <p>I am just over 1 week into my Surface Pro 4 and the type cover stops working randomly - either the keyboard or track pad or both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have googled it and it seems alot of people have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't work for me - I need to rely on this device which means the keyboard / track pad MUST work 100% of the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no excuse for a releasing a product that has a fundamental problem with it's core input. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>So please advice me on how to permanently fix this problem so it doesn't reoccur? &nbsp;I have read posts saying things like open/close it the reboot. But these are not good enough for a device that cost over ¬£1000.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>So before I take it back to the shop and get a refund, can anybody let me know whether there is a proper fix for this problem because for me as it stands it's a show stopper.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, DO return it to the shop and repurchase (or get a refund). DO NOT exchange online via Surface Support.

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to reinforce what&nbsp;Barb said, make sure your device is updated by checking your&nbsp;Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Start button </strong>-&gt;<strong> Settings </strong>-&gt;<strong> Update &amp; Security
</strong>-&gt;<strong> Windows Update.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively you can also download and run the "<span>SurfacePro4_Win10_160128_0.msi" file&nbsp;from our driver pack list
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here </a>to make sure the device is updated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device is fully updated, or if you now updated the device, i recommend you also attempt a two-button shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Press and hold the&nbsp;volume-button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> After you have released the buttons, wait an additional 10 seconds before you attempt to power on the device again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> It might also be worth to double-check for updates once more after you have performed&nbsp;the two-button shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Hawkie&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't believe this is a "fundamental problem" as your experience is not typical.&nbsp; You may just have a faulty unit.&nbsp; Are you using the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover or&nbsp;the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID?</p>

            <p>Well, don't feel too bad. &nbsp;My Surface Pro 3 has developed the exact same problem with the Type Keyboard with the latest update. &nbsp;SO frustrating!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a trick that works on my Pro 3 so hopefully it will also work on your Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off the device. &nbsp;Turn it back on holding the power and the volume UP buttons for about 10 seconds until it goes into the BIOS boot mode and Exit that mode and let it start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works but what a MAJOR pain that this is happening on such expensive devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft and fix this!!!</p>

            <p>I am a programmer myself and I am pretty clear that software is the problem.</p>
<p>for example, I have been introduced to the 'blue screen of sad face' - that only happened after I had installed updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The keyboard I have is the one without the fingerprint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have been using Apple kit professionally since 2010 after spending a decade as a programmer on the Microsoft platform. Since 2010 I have had no issues with the hardware and no significant issues with the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have had this surface less than a month and I have a keyboard that stops working sporadically- it has happened less often since applying updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now I have had blue screen of death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is is a very poor show on a brand new device that cost over ¬£1000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if this happened on an apple I would take it into the store and they would fix it for me and I would not have to be without my machine when it is so new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say I love the surface when it works but for the money I spent I do not expect to be facing the issues I have seen already. The quality control on this just does not match the price point. This product was not ready for release of it means a buyer
 has to deal with these issues within days and weeks of getting the product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can be forgiving of peripheral issues such as a loss of sound, or certain features in Windows buggy. But to have a buggy keyboard is terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If if there is not an update in the next week or so that fixes my problem then this is not fit for purpose and it is going back and I want a refund. And I will wait and buy a MacBook Pro 13 instead as a safer option. I need this as my work machine and I
 cannot rely on this at present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want this surface to be my workhorse so this is very disappointing because aside from the reliability issues, I am delighted with it. But I need to make the decision to get out while I still can still insist on a refund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
