    <title>Headset Mic Not Working in Windows 10 laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cosmobuggi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset Mic Not Working in Windows 10 laptop.</h2>
                    <p>My headset is a Turtle Beach headset with a removeable microphone, and it has one audio jack that triggers both the audio that comes out of it, and the microphone, but since last night, the mic has not worked for me, although the audio out of the headset
 itself works just fine. The internal mic of the laptop also works just fine, but when i try to use the headset mic, i just hear static. When looking around in the System Sounds, the "Microphone Array" seems to be working just fine, although when i ran a troubleshoot
 on sound problems, it has detected a problem with the Generic Audio Driver. At the same time, I noticed it is doing this thing where, when i first start playing sound, it has kind of a tinny feel to it, and this has happened before (it doesn't always happen),
 but this time it takes longer than normal before it adjusts itself into having a heavier sound (almost a minute and a half as opposed to somewhere less than a minutue) Not sure if this helps to give any idea on what i can do to fix it, but i figured i would
 give out every detail i know of just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I have tried pretty much all of these aside from the rollback. Everything I have tried doesn't seem to do anything. The most i get is the troubleshooter for Playing Audio finds a problem with "Generic Audio Driver". I have updated realtek, I have messed
 around with other things in the settings, No progress is made. I am also noticing along with this weird thing that happened that each time I play sounds somewhere for the first time turning the laptop on either after it has been off or after restarting, it
 has a tinny sound to it, and it lasts longer than normal before it adjusts itself to be less tinny and more full sounding, it started at the same time as the mic issues, if this is any help.

    <title>drive is not accessible after extend using partition wizard 9... any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnjackie  say:</h3>
<h2>            drive is not accessible after extend using partition wizard 9... any idea what&#39;s the proper resolution of this issue</h2>
                    Drive E 'main data partition which contains all my important files' becomes <strong>
RAW (not NTFS)</strong> after extending OS Drive C using partition wizard 9 software which finished successfully without errors! (all details available below):<br />
<br />
MY HARDDISK WAS RUNNING WITHOUT PROBLEMS BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE AND WAS CHECKED FOR ERRORS PERIODICALLY<br />
<br />
I installed <span style="color: rgba(57, 24, 144, 1)">partition wizard 9</span> and used it to extend drive C by taking 12 GB of space from my drive E which contain all my data and clicked apply it runs perfectly without problems and all finished successfully !! and it's
 done without asking me for restart then when I go to my computer found space applied successfully but I can't access drive E and it tells me drive is corrupt and can't be accessed so I checked it with check file system in this software and I found some sort
 of issue in stage 2 also checked it using chkdsk e: /x /r and gives me same issue and stop continuing check and fix process!!:<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(144, 24, 26, 1)"><strong>stage 2 examining file name linkage</strong><br />
<strong>correcting error in index $SDH for file 9</strong><br />
<strong>unspecified error occurred (766f6c756d652e63 461)</strong><br />
</span><br />
tried to restart.. windows automatically run into automatic repair for drive E and boot to windows and still drive E not accessible also tried disk management says healthy drive but I found it read drive E as<span style="color: rgba(24, 47, 144, 1)"> RAW not NTFS!!
</span>... tried to rerun extend again with small space (100MB) and finished successfully and gives me same result as mentioned above.. tried to seek technical support of partition wizard their answer was to try using
<span style="color: rgba(57, 24, 144, 1)">partition wizard bootable CD</span> and re apply the extend again which I did and extended it by 5 GB again which applied successfully without any problems and when I logged back to windows it gave me same result (space applied to
 C but E isn't accessible) ..<br />
as a note I am running windows 8.1 64bit on HDD with 2 partitions (C 'OS', E 'full data') and have USB stick always plugged in and was having in that partition couple of mklink folders and I am using ramdisk too. I also recovered some important files .. under
 support second advice using <span style="color: rgba(57, 24, 144, 1)">their recovery software </span>
thanks to them.. but it's large partition and can't recover all important files there and wasn't sure all the files will still run or not after the recovery takes place and if I formatted this drive now my chances to recover these files to its original place
 are little (as it will destroy itself) by rewriting itself on same partition if I intended to recover this large partition files to its original place after formatting as I don't have this space available on other partition or HDD also I can't understand what's
 wrong (as checking drive gives unspecified error and stop continuing and there is no undo process or restore point I can go back to and I can't get it how the extend completed successfully while I can't enter my drive !)... I tried to apply extend back to
 drive E but gives me message which says there is a known bug in the software which makes overlapping partition if extended back!!. also tried resize it which finished successfully but still drive E not accessible and gave me same result!.<br />
<br />
help me if there is a way to solve file name linkage issue or another way to check desk and fix errors without need to format partition and take the risk of losing all my data in it or make this partition read again as NTFS not RAW so I can log into it or..
 is it related to master boot record or some sort of error I can't figure out and give me some technical details if u require some logs or want me install any other program! to solve this issue completely<br />
<br />
these are the screenshots :<br />

<br />
finally I tried <span style="color: rgba(57, 24, 144, 1)">active partition recovery software </span>
with superscan and fix boot sector and recovery partition (which asked me to delete partition which has problem before recover it which I did using disk management) and applied recovery partition but gave me same result and same issue (and to make sure that
 it has no negative effect on files after this deletion I tested some files using recovery again and files looks okay) and I also tried some check disk in utilities (like tuneup utilities which not proceed on raw partition!)...<br />
<br />
couple of thoughts:<br />
<br />
I used minitool power data recovery from their support: and chose damaged partition recovery then opened biggest partition (without full scan just opening) and it processed with virtual file system and gave me recovered files (note: partition didn't have letter
 unlike others and its type was NTFS not RAW in that software) then I filtered to show only normal files and I recovered some important data and they works fine so is there a way to recover all partition in its place without take the risk of formatting it and
 try to recover data again in it after formatting (which may destroy all recovered files) as I don't have that space..
<span style="color: rgba(18, 47, 86, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(18, 52, 86, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(14, 120, 225, 1)">is there a way to get rid of some data in that inaccessible drive and make a new partition from it</span></span></span> to use it for safe recovery or

<br />
I know it's couple of thoughts but who knows.. may be geek around help

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to use Drive E after using partition wizard 9 software. As it is a third party software so it has caused some issue then Microsoft&nbsp;is not responsible. However, we will try our level best to fix your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you have already run CHKDSK, which didn't help you to fix the issue. As you have mentioned that you are unable to complete this command as it get stuck at stage 2. So it means there might be a chance that the issue is with hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before contacting the manufacturer of your computer, I would suggest you to check
<span><span>the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong><span>System File Checker (SFC)</span></strong> tool.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If SFC found corrupt files and could not repair them it means there is some corruption and it need to be repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you will reinstall Windows, nothing will be lost from E drive because Operating system will be installed on C drive not in the E drive. But make sure that you should not install Windows by formatting the drives.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I still have main issue of Drive E .. what you suggest to go on with troubleshooting with it. any tools can I use..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll leave re installation of windows as my last step but if I intended to reinstall, I will use bootable USB with windows 8.1 and will format drive C and system reserved partition before re installation&nbsp; to do clean install of windows.. is there any risk
 if I did that on files on drive E as it still not accessible and logging into windows become a little bit slower after repair..

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I still stick with my statement that nothing will be lost from E drive if you only install Operating System without affecting other drives. If Operating system is installed on C drive then reinstallation will affect all of the files saved in C drive
 and not affect files on other drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to be in safer side if you can have a backup of those files that will be great. Hope information provided is helpful. Do keep us updated about the issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>I know main issue is still exist but there&nbsp;are some updates.. first thank you very much for this informative help and follow up .. I backed up&nbsp;the most important files to USB flash memory that contains bootable windows just in&nbsp;case and used it to&nbsp;install
 new windows from scratch&nbsp;by formatting Drive C and system reserved partition only (also deleted them to combine unallocated space found during installation from tests I've done on Drive E before)
<strong>without</strong> making any changes to drive E .. after&nbsp;windows installation finished I installed minitool power data recovery to test files on drive E and see if they are still working fine after&nbsp;windows&nbsp;re installation or not and they look fine..
 Iam still trying to find a way to recover partition E without losing data there but at least now I reinstalled windows without affecting data on Drive E.. thank you.</p>

                    File Explorer in Windows 10 has been acting up, showing (Not Responding) more and more often. It is also hanging up while doing Copy/Move from external sources to one of the internal drives. Most recently, it has stopped showing all network computers and

            If your installation of Windows 10 is exhibiting strange behavior that doesn't seem to resolve through typical troubleshooting you may need to perform a "Repair Upgrade". This will reinstall windows over top of your existing installation and will preserve personal files and settings. Here is a detailed tutorial to follow<br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

    <title>xbox one kinect cable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dudeskis01  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox one kinect cable</h2>
                    
<p>what kind of cable is it going to be? will there be options for 40' to 60' lengths if it is a propriety cable? with in wall insulation?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>i keep my equipment in another room and the hdmi cable has a bit of slack with 50' after running through walls and under my house. im guessing the kinect will be above the tv so it will have to be a few feet longer.</p>

<p>this article makes it sound like it will be usb 3.0 with propriety connectors:

<p>i dont know much about usb 3.0. hopefully you can convert it to cat 6 for long lengths in walls and ms will make adapters available.</p>

<p>I think the big question would be how much power it draws. I would bet it will be lower than the current Kinect since it needs more that USB can supply. I know you can get one with a power supply for 360s before the slim so look at that spec and maybe cut
 the power use in half as a rough estimate. Shouldn't really need much power since the Kinect has a set of processors to offload a lot of work the console would otherwise have to do while the Xbox One version probably just dumps the data right to the console.</p>

<p>i would need two and im not sure those are cl2 rated so they could pick up a lot of distortion in wall, i dont know how usb signals work. there is also concern of how they are powered because id have to link 2 so powering the second one could be confusing.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>and ofcourse the cost is insane for 2. depending if they charge tax it could be $230 to $250. plus id need adapters on both ends.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure CL2 ratings have to do with time before combustion in fire and not about distortion in walls. The signal should work fine but the cost definitely is prohibitive. Maybe there is a chance at wireless USB 3 with 802.11ac coming out now.</p>

<p>you are correct it is a fire rating. but in my experience non cl2 rated wires pick up lots of distortion. i know if i use non cl2 hdmi cables in wall there is noticeable video and audio distortion.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>cat6 i have no way of testing, but it is so cheap that there is no point in testing it out.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>so this could be specific to hdmi cables, but i dont want to spend $250 to find out.</p>

<p>Hello - Thanks so much for your reply..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To let you know, i'm using my own home-private network and no chance of connecting to different source any just FYI: speed of my network is superb and no doubt in this. For sure, the problem is with microsoft skype and nothing do with network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since last 4 days this is the 2nd time I uninstalled and did installation and again last night&nbsp; i did reset the app n again uninstalled and installed. I may not using any skype credit for making calls, Just skype contacts video or without video calls. And
 very rarely, I can say once in a while I use video call. 99% its just skype contact call.&nbsp; The problem started very recently, yesterday when I sent messages the messages were never sent and in regard to calls, the call gets connected and I say hello and from
 other end they say hello and we both can hear voices and within 1 sec nothing audible and i later the call gets disconnected or I have to forcefully disconnect as I can't hear anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS : Windows 10 :Skype version :12.1807.264.0 (snapshot attached)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are working for Microsoft and belong Microsoft team, it would be great if you can connect to my system remotely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Request to resolve asap.Thank You..</p>

<p>Does anyone have any past experience with this retailer?</p>
<p>Their website is shopplay.co.uk and it seems to in some way be affiliated with eBay.</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that they currently have listed FIFA 14 (Download Code) for £27.99. Which is quite tempting.</p>
<p>The item listing is <a href="http://www.shopplay.co.uk/games/xbox-one/fifa-14-digital-download-xbox-one.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>Any input would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>All these kind of pop ups are fake alerts. Your PC is NOT infected.</p>
<p>Do NOT call the phone-number which is displayed in that fake alert.</p>
<p>It leads to scammers who try to trick you into giving them access to your computer, to steal your passwords etc and to sell you their unneeded services etc.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">I was on the web browser Window 10 as always for search something, I think that I was on one of those sites like : Amazon or ebay, so it was all the sudden pop up another smaller screen be just below down of the browser, that
 was how it said that&nbsp;</span> "RDN/Trojan.worm!055BCC9824064 infection", also, it was a toll free number to call for the solution for it too, so I made a call, but the answer was not available, so that was it, so then, I thought my PC could have infected, and
 I do not know how to find this type of folder to delete it, that's why I would like to have some one can tell me how to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not add any software or download at all for a real long time.</p>
<p>I do not have any external devices connected to this PC at the time when that was happened.</p>
<p>I do sometime had the error messages like the page has not responding then it closed.</p>
<p>I did not installed any software to this PC.</p>
<p>I did not taken any troubleshooting steps for it yet.</p>

            Well, in the sense, it may to helps me&nbsp;as you told not to open " phony emails"&nbsp; and not to call those numbers from the scammer, so I am really be cautious from now on, so since the last time I had the threaten messages pop up, and now I don't see it no
 more, it could be from the new updated after it, anyway, I am so very appreciated your info. to me, so I will know my PC is not really infected by the virus;&nbsp; but my PC is slower than before, so is it cause by it or not, that I don't really know for sure,
 my PC is slower now. Thanks for your helped me on my this issue.

<p>Did you turn off deep freeze before uninstalling ?</p>
<p>Might re-install deep freeze, and disable things its does, and then be sure to use its regular uninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've missed probably tons of updates and behind the scenes changes.&nbsp; Might need to just download the
<a href="http://aka.ms/DownloadW10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">windows 10 iso</a> for use on another computer and double click it and run its setup, to do a refresh/upgrade install.</p>

            Yes, DEEP FREEZE can not be uninstalled until we make it off, I have seen many people are facing this issue, Well I think now only option left is to install new window and Avoid using DEEP FREEZE.

            Hi, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br /> 
<br />How slow from power off? How slow from restart?
<br />
<br />I would do a Performance check for the entire system.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a  process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />Process Monitor - Free - an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more.

<br />=====
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

    <title>Computer boots to black screen after uninstalling the display drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sajibacharya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer boots to black screen after uninstalling the display drivers</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: &lt;A dark bluish film appears on my display screen&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6-7 days after i newly install Windows 7 Ultimate x64 on my notebook, a dark bluish film kind of something appears on my screen that makes things difficult to view on the screen. I have tried several times re-installing windows, but that did not help. At
 first, every thing seems fine, but after 6-7 days, this bluish film appears on my screen. I tried to increase my display brightness, but though I could see my display brightness increasing, still I can very well see this bluish film. Previously it never happened,
 but I noticed that after I dual booted my system with the Ubuntu OS (I installed the OS within windows), it happens. But I did this previously also, but that did not return me this problem.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to log in with Safe Mode, that worked perfectly fine, no bluish film appeared and the display was clear.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried plugging a secondary external display, and that worked fine too, both in Safe Mode and Normal Mode. though the notebook display showed a bluish film, the secondary display did not. I thought it maybe my notebook display screen problem (hardware
 problem), but what I noticed is that when I start my notebook, the&nbsp;Diagnostic Boot screen shows perfect brightness, even the Windows Boot Screen shows perfect brightness, but as the Welcome Screen appears, the bluish screen also appears, but that is not same
 for the secondary Display. It works fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even the notebook display for the Ubuntu OS works fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So i tried to uninstall the Display Driver, and re-install it. As soon as I uninstalled the display driver, my screen went complete black (it did no shut down, but became black) while the external display is working fine. When I re-installed the Display
 Driver, the display did not come back for my notebook, but is working fine for my secondary display.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Still now, after the Windows Boot Screen, the notebook screen goes complete black, but the welcome screen appears on the secondary Display. The notebook screen is working fine for the Ubuntu OS and even till the Windows Boot Screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not know what to do, please help.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My notebook has a ATI Mobility Raedon HD 4500/5100 512MB graphics card.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Driver version is</div>
<div>&nbsp;2009.0905.2131.36801</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried the updated driver version</div>
<div>2011.1205.2215.39827</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both returned the same problem.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall the drivers in safe mode with networking, re-install the latest drivers while in safe mode with networking and then check if you face the same issue.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Safe mode with networking.</strong></p>
<p>Boot your computer into safe mode with networking.</p>
<p><b>Start your computer in safe mode</b></p>

<p><b>Note</b>: While at the advanced boot options, select <strong>Safe mode with networking</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Uninstall the drivers.</strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <strong>start</strong>, in the search box type in
<b>devmgmt.msc</b> and hit <strong>enter</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Locate the <strong>display adapter</strong>, expand it, right click on your graphics card and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When you get an option, select the option to remove the drivers</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong>Restart</strong> the computer and boot back into
<strong>safe mode with networking</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Download and install the latest drivers.</strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>While in safe mode with networking, download the latest drivers from the following link.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista64.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista64.aspx</a></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Install the drivers.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restart the computer in normal mode and check for the issue.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Advanced Warfare Season Pass issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> this guy tom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Advanced Warfare Season Pass issue</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the AW Season Pass on the 360 because of the upgrade program so I would get the pass on the Xbox One free and when I start up AW it won't show in it's in-game store that I own it on Xbox One. However, my Xbox says that I already own it even when
 I hit buy in-game for the Pass and when I really want to play on ATLAS-Gorge, the Xbox Store says that map is unavailable. Idk what's going on and Idk if I can ever access dlc in this game anymore other than the Advanced Arsenal from Day Zero. Someone please
 help me out because I'll be kinda upset if I'm not going to be able to get anything for this game anymore.</p>

<li>From the Dashboard, navigate to My games &amp; apps.</li>
<li>Select Games and navigate to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.</li>
<li>Press the Menu button and select Manage game.</li>
<li>On the right side you should see the seasons pass.</li>
