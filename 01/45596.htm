<h2>            Restoring start menu after disabling STARTUP EVENT TRACE SESSIONS</h2>
                    I disabled all of&nbsp;<strong>Startup Event Trace Sessions</strong>, though some returned errors. Now start menu and Cortana are broken. Can you please give suggestions on how to restore them to a working state.

    <title>finding drivers for CanoScan LiDE 30&#47;N1240U scanner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e charleswright  say:</h3>
<h2>            finding drivers for CanoScan LiDE 30&#47;N1240U scanner</h2>
                    <p>I have a CanoScan LiDE 30/N1240U scanner, that worked fine under&nbsp;Windows Xp&nbsp;sp3 (32bit), Canon has drivers for that OS, but not for Windows 8 RT (64bit). I tried to use 'Windows driver update/find driver' tools, none found.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tool box software from Canon
 will run (I think I set it to run as Xp sp3), but needs to find a driver which for a 32bit system is packaged as lide20lide30n670un676un1240uvst7031a_xpen.exe and was found at Canon.&nbsp; Window 8 will not recognize that driver because it is a 32bit driver. Or
 I do not know how to set up a Xp sp3 environment that will accept the install of that driver as if it were running the &nbsp;thing as 32bit.
</p>
<p>I do not plan on throwing out the scanner, I do have an Xp machine that just has a fix using restore console&nbsp;that needs to be done to it, it would be nice to get Windows 8 to use the scanner too. Does Widows 8 support scanners, and what drivers will work?
 Do I have to wait for support to catch up to get plug and play back? Are drivers for scanners compatible with other scanners? I have to do more research, if someone can point the direction of research that would be helpful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It’s unfortunate that you are unable to find drivers for Canon Scanner LiDE 30/N1240U.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>64 bit drivers for any operating system are not available from the cannon website.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I checked the Canon site, and emailed their support people, they agreed the problem is no drivers, and put my request in the queue for making them, they also gave me a reduced price on a replacement scanner, of about the same size and portability as the
 Lide 30 scanner, a Lide 210, that has 64 bit drivers. Since the old scanner will work with 32 bit machines, and I have found it a good machine that should still work for a long time, I will save it for the new drivers when they come out. But for the now, I
 have a new scanner on the way that might be a little upgrade, and will get me back the archiving estate papers as well as making scans for e delivery.&nbsp; Which did save me a lot of gas, for my retraining paperwork, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will wait for the announcement of new drivers as a solution for this problem...I did check to see if the 64 bit drivers for the new machine would be accepted for the old one...nope.... but they are installed and waiting on Fed Ex.</p>

I did get a replacement LiDE scanner for a reduced price from the manufacturer, and the creation of drivers is on the to do list there, but I have not checked recently... I find the new scanner works well, but I will be keeping the old one to work with 32bit
 a 32bit machine that needs a software fix, and I will be waiting for the new 64bit drivers, so the place to look for the drivers when they come out would be the Canon website... the more people who show up and ask about the drivers, will help keep it on their
 to do list... If you hear something post it back here, and I will do the same.

<p>Hi I have the same problem with a windows 8.1 upgrade. why build a machine that outlasts the software spec? waste is obviously incorporated into the price. I was wondering if you have a solution to the problem?</p>

<p>I have not checked for some time, but the place to check is the Canon website... I have not done the fix on the Xp machine yet,&nbsp;that the old scanner was paired to for portable scanning... not a task that needs an internet connection... so updating from Xp
 on that machine is not really needed. My Lide 30 does not need new drivers as long as it is used with the Xp machine. I will still be watching for the drivers.... The Lide 210 has done well with the W8.1 machine.</p>

            <p>In checking the driver site at Canon the ease of checking on the problem was simpler.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/scanners/canoscan_series/canoscan_lide_30#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/scanners/canoscan_series/canoscan_lide_30#DriversAndSoftware</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The scanner is still listed
 there and those that have the compatible OS drivers can be found. Win 8.1 is not supported in checking the different OS options Vista seems to be the last supported version. The Win 7 up notices include discussion phone numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before I have an Xp machine that I might get around to fixing that will work fine... the new LiDE scanner is working fine with&nbsp;Win 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As before if someone sees a driver support change I would be interested in finding out. The link above would be the first place I would check.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a search for the German site from the global one... my German is a bit rusty... but I got partway by the product category name (CanoScan) and got to this point.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you follow the links to the product version you have, you might be able to check the status for your operating system... If it is not supported you can contact support and ask them about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible round about. could be to install a emulation version of windows/mac that supports the scanner, then install the driver into that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More of a dance them I want to do. Someone else might have some ideas in that line.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is not the cables all cables are CAT 5e. Note from 1st post that I took my MacBook Pro and hard wired it and it is receiving the 500 Mbps and this is with the same cords I am using with the laptop and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

            Hence my question on the hardware in play here.&nbsp; Some hardware may only have a network port which is 100Mpbs.&nbsp; Of you might have Gig connectivity.&nbsp; Hence dependent on the network port hardware you may never get above 100Mbps.

<p>I just discovered it july 30. Is there still a way to get the update to complete or is the only possibility to buy?</p>

            <p>There might still be a small window of opportunity, its worth a try.</p>
<p>If the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant becomes stuck or unresponsive at various percentages: 0%, 32%, 62%, 87%, 99%, please wait at least 4 to 7 hours. If you are updating through Windows Update, when the download reaches 99% disconnect from the Internet LAN
 (Ethernet) or Wi-Fi then proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>If setup does not progress, close the wizard then restart your computer. Follow the instructions to upgrade manually using the Media Creation Tool or the Windows 10 ISO file.

    <title>Recovery Email From Microsoft is not my own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexforseth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Email From Microsoft is not my own</h2>
                    <p>So I recently became reminded of an old Skype account that I stopped using for various reasons. I had forgotten the password so of course I had to go through the Microsoft password recovery process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While going through the account recovery process with microsoft I noticed that the recovery email that microsoft had listed was owned by an acquaintance's. This aquantince owned a computer that I use to log on to the Skype application years ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am worried that I remained logged in and that person then changed the recovery email address and did who knows what with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if it is possible to change a Skype accounts recovery email without email confirmation first? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to remain logged in to Skype and change your recovery email and password?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And how do I further rectify this situation with Microsoft? I called calling but they just referred me to the Skype forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi Mrlee2071,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Run video play troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Video playback &gt; Click and run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />2. Use VLC Media Player
<br />It is better to use VLC Media Player which has all the codecs required and will play all the audio and video files.
<br />
<br />To download VLC - <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html</a>
<br />
<br />3. For Browsers  i.e. online videos
<br />For Firefox
<br />Click 3 horizontal bars on top right &gt; Options &gt; Under Performance uncheck use recommended performance settings &gt; Uncheck Use hardware acceleration when available
<br />
<br />For Chrome
<br />Click 3 vertical dots on top left &gt; Settings &gt; Click Advanced at the end &gt; Go down and under System, switch OFF Use hardware acceleration where available
<br />
<br />For Edge
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type following and Enter
<br />inetcpl.cpl
<br />Advanced tab &gt; Check Use Software rendering instead GPU rendering (This is the first option appearing beneath Accelerated graphics)
<br />

<br />
<br />There are two other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I ran the Rootkit Scanner &amp; Remover as a routine ( wish I hadn't! ). I was using it as I did Ccleaner and didn't know it would remove files I needed.</p>
<p>I downloaded Windows 10 so do not have the installation disc,how do I proceed from here?</p>
<p>I have done a malware check and found a couple of PUP's which I have removed.</p>
<p>Have tried Ccleaner since and it still will not open.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>"didn't know it would remove files I needed" - it sounds like that rootkit cleaner thinks ccleaner is malware.&nbsp; If that was all that disappeared then I'd say you should just reinstall ccleaner if you want to use it for cleaning up temp files etc [not to
 clean the Registry].&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since you say that more than ccleaner has gone, I'd suggest a <em><span>Repair install</span></em><span>, also called an

<p>You can find the setting I think you are after in the Compatibility tab on your games shortcut or main .exe file.</p>
<p>- R/click on the shortcut and go to <em>Properties.</em> Click on<em> Compatibility.</em></p>
<p>- Click on the<em> Change High DPI Setting</em> button (the button is new with the 1803 update).</p>
<p>At the bottom, tic the box next to <em>'Override High DPI Scaling Behaviour' </em>
.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The fun thing about this setting is Windows has been enabling it automatically on a lot of games that don't need it since</p>
<p>1709 (maybe 1703 ? ), but fails to do so on a lot of games that <em>do</em> need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- However, this may not be what you want....</p>
<p>This setting normally only applies when a game does not fit on the screen. In most cases the image is pushed down, and to the right</p>
<p>with some of the image off the monitor, which can also make it difficult to close some games as the option buttons are off screen</p>
<p>and can't be reached.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"whenever i start the game it has black bars"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not quite clear if you are running the game at 1280x800 or the native resolution of your monitor is 1280x800...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A 16:10 wide screen resolution. </p>
<p>Whatever the case, if the resolution you are running in the game is not native to the aspect ratio of your monitor you will</p>
<p>likely get black bars.</p>
<p>- So if you are using a 1280x800 on a monitor with a 16:9 native resolution you are likely to see small black bars on the sides to
</p>
<p>compensate for the extra height, and keep the image proportions original.</p>
<p>Some games will automatically scale to full screen when using a 16:10 resolution on a 16:9 monitor, but many don't.</p>
<p>- If your monitor resolution is 1280x800 and the game is using 1024x768 = wide black bars,</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You can normally force a game that uses 4:3, 5:4, 16:10 resolutions to run on a 16:9 monitor in full screen in your graphics processors
</p>
<p>control panel by selecting <em>Full Screen </em>rather than <em>Aspect Ratio</em>, or similarly termed setting.</p>

<p>Is this a monitor or TV ? The industry normally uses 16:10 as the standard term, but maybe some mfg are using 8:5 these days.
</p>
<p>Is the image centred ? If the game is setup to use 1280x800 there should be no black bars on the sides of the image if it is
</p>
<p>centred on the screen. If not, then the Scaling Behaviour probably does need to be overridden.<br />

<p>first it is a laptop screen and i think 8:5 and 16:10 are the same thing at least that is what the interent says but i just cheked i website to find my apsect ratio and it said 16:10&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I thought laptop at first, but because TV mfg's like to do things different I thought maybe a TV advertised as 8:5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- That white box next to 'Override....'&nbsp; is what you want to click on.</p>

<p>Yes, I understood that. I was only elaborating on what is most common. But what about the rest ?

<p>Did disabling High DPI in both the <em>PES2017.exe</em> (may not be correct title)&nbsp; and the

<p>That's actually a good question. I don't believe so, plus, they could easily invite you to their game/private chat/party chat. It's a good thing you can't join people at will, else it would be more common.</p>

<p>Thanks. My profile is pretty much hidden to people that don't know me/who I play with. I only accept invites from people I pretty much know.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I noticed that if the potential predator/hacker invites you to a party THEY host, they can get your IP. Same goes with a game. If they're host, they can still retrieve it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If they're on a server that they didn't host. I don't think they could really get it. Unless they have access to the server's logs/are admins on the server, then I honestly don't think so.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Have you ever played PC Minecraft? You can join people's servers and only the owner has access to the list of connecting IPs.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Idk, thats just what I think :P.</p>

<p>Even in PC Minecraft, if it's only the Host who is presented with a list of IPs, other players trying to find them could easily do so. You're not presented with IPs playing Halo or Call of Duty but DDoS attacks and worse still happens here.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>They also don't have to invite you.... any real-time connection between them and you gives them your IP. Messaging doesn't, but if they join your Party or Game they've got it immediately. They'd just make sure they weren't searching (ie, weren't connected
 to other &nbsp;IPs) and then join your party. Most recent IPs are you/anyone else in the party, minus the IP for the game, XBL and perhaps a few others (but they'd be well familiar with these and ignore them)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Then all you'd have to do is discern where each IP comes from. If you're from the US, one of your mates is too and the other three in the Party are English, it's a 50/50 chance that they pick you out (because they can immediately disqualify anyone not from
 the US) and if we're talking about a DDoS to keep you offline, most programs could easily shut down two IPs at once.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As far as actually accessing someone's computer, I'd say it's fairly likely they wouldn't try it or wouldn't try it for very long if they weren't absolutely sure it was the correct IP. Lots of digging around and research to do and it's --probably-- not worth
 doing twice.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Through Xbox Live Parties/Chat. How would they get an IP when every player connects to a server? Only the server admin has access to the IP list/log, right?".</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You don't need Party Chat/Private Chat/an invite to the target's pre-game lobby to find their IP. As soon as you join a P2P game, all player IPs and the IP for the game and service (possibly your ISP provider/more) can be detected. It just helps to invite
 someone so that you're sure of the IP.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I don't know if you could still do that with a game that uses dedicated servers... it depends on whether the server relays the game's information without actually a player's IP to the other players, but I'd say it would... I'm pretty sure either that it
 would or that you could still find the IP with a slightly different technique.</p>

<h2>            windows &#39;picture resize&#39; option box has disappeared when wanting to resize pics for emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi and hope someone can help.&nbsp; When I click on a picture in 'my pictures' on my XP computer the 'windows can resize your picture' option box no longer comes up on the screen.&nbsp; I have always had this and use it all the time as I am a photographer.&nbsp; I really
 really miss it, so if someone can help me get it back or turn it on again, I would be really grateful...</p>
<p>So, this is the usual method I have of sending a smaller pic in an email - click on the pic or pics I want to send - right click - send to - mail recipient - then the box pops up to ask if I want to resize the pics (I have a choice of small, medium or full
 size) - after this a blank email opens with the pics already in the attachments section - then I just go ahead as normal to send.</p>
<p>So no box pops up now.&nbsp; Any help much appreciated with this.&nbsp; I feel like my arm has been cut off as my pic files are way too big to email as they are.....</p>
<p>Thanx, Suz&nbsp; PS. As you can tell I'm not really good at the technical stuff so if you could word any answers in 'baby talk' that would be great, ie click on&nbsp;this, select that, press OK etc etc.&nbsp; :)))</p>

<br />The purpose of Windows 10 messaging client can integrate multiple internet-based services, creating a single conversation for each person regardless of the apps they use. Think of it as a parallel to the unified chat feeds in Apple's Messages app or Google's Hangouts, except that you're not limited to a handful of online providers.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how you Getting started with Windows 10's Messaging app:

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />

Damn.. great minds think alike! I have to hand it to you. I was not expecting a reply for at least 6+ hours.&nbsp;And your post was pretty clear and concise.<br />
I saw on another post similar to my problem how skydrive was used, resolved to put up my dump files up there. Just had to give you props.&nbsp;<br />

            Thanks for the kind words!<br />
<br />
We have a few different bug checks here, but really only one of them is relevant as it takes priority over the rest:<br />
<br />
<u><b>WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR (124)</b></u><br />
<br />
<p><i>A fatal hardware error has occurred. This fatal error displays data from the Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA).</i></p>
<br />
<p>If we run an !errrec on the 2nd parameter of the bugcheck (address of the WER structure) we get the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>

&nbsp; Status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 0xb200004000000800<br />
<br />
BUSL0_SRC_ERR_M_NOTIMEOUT_ERR implies that the processor (in this case Processor 1) sent out a read request, and there was a delay in return (cache miss, invalid data, etc).<br />
<br />
There is only so much you can do with a bugcheck like this until it comes down to a faulty processor that will need to be replaced. Start from 1 and work downward. First off, I would run Memtest for no less than ~8 passes as well (several hours):<br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<u><b>--------------</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>1. </b>Ensure your temperatures are within standard and nothing's overheating. You can use a program such as Speccy if you'd like to monitor temps -
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy</a><br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Clear your CMOS (or load optimized BIOS defaults) to ensure there's no improper BIOS setting -

<br />
<b>3. </b>Ensure your BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
<b>4. </b>The <i><b>only</b></i> software conflict that can usually cause *124 bugchecks are OS to BIOS utilities from manufacturer's like Asus' AI Suite. If you have something like this software-wise, remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
<b>5. </b>If all of the above fail, the only left to do is replace your processor as it is faulty.<br />
