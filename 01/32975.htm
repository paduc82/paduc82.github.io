<h2>            Cannot Start Windows After Installing Driver&#59; Cannot Enter Safe Mode</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I just installed a new driver for my nVidia card in an attempt to get Modern Warfare 2 to stop slowing down. Now I can't even start Windows. Right after the logo comes up, I get a blue screen with this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>I can't even go into safe mode because when I select it, the computer just restarts and goes back to the blue screen. Nothing works. So now, because of a single bad driver (that probably didn't do a thing) my $1000 laptop is useless after less than a week.
 Someone help me out here because this is complete nonsense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember: I CAN'T GET PAST THE BLUE SCREEN NO MATTER WHAT I DO. So don't tell me to go to the start menu or anything, because I can't get past basic startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I cannot enter safe mode. When I try to, the list of drivers comes up and then it's back to the blue screen. This PC is useless. I spent $1000 on it and have had it for less than a week, and now I can't even reboot. Thanks, Microsoft. I've gone through
 two 360s and now I have to get a new laptop. Oh yeah, and I work for minimum wage, so the latter won't happen. I just wasted my money on a computer that lasted me six days. You people refuse to do a thing because you're not paid to run this forum. So thanks
 for that. I know that if I wait a week I still won't have an answer. I am so pissed right now. One little file screwed up the whole system. Wow. I was supposed to do a presentation at school tomorrow, too. So thanks, now I'm probably going to fail. And don't
 start with backups, because I don't have any storage media. You know, because I work for $7 an hour.</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to do a System Restore by booting from the Windows 7 disk.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer's system is severely damaged and you cannot access the System Recovery Options
 menu on your computer, you can access it using the <span>Windows&nbsp;7</span> installation disc or a system repair disc you created earlier.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer
 from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To use this method, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the disc.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Insert the disc.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer using the computer's power button.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If prompted, press any key to start
<span>Windows</span> from the installation disc. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>If your computer isn't configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change
 your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BIOS: frequently asked questions</a><span>.</span></span></p>

<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose your language settings, and then click
<span><strong>Next</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are using the
<span>Windows</span> installation disc, click <span><strong>Repair your computer</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the
<span>Windows</span> installation you want to repair, and then click <span><strong>Next</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<span><strong>System Recovery Options</strong></span> menu, click a tool to open it.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click System restore and restore the computer to an earlier point in time when the issue did not exist.</span></span></p>

    <title>Syncing errors with Fallout 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darkest shimi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing errors with Fallout 4</h2>
                    
<p>We've been having real problems with getting Fallout 4 up and running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're currently on c.9 days gametime. After having had some issues with being able to connect with Xbox Live, *I think* we spent some time playing Fallout 4 offline (but no more than a few hours, at most, I reckon). After resolving the Xbox Live connectivity
 issue, we're now experiencing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Fallout 4 </li><li>Select A </li><li>Next screen that loads is a 'Syncing data for Fallout 4' message, with a progress bar.&nbsp;
</li><li>Sync takes place for c.2-3 hours. Then, either an error message is shown or we get stuck on 99%.
</li></ol>
<p>I assume the console is trying to sync our offline play with whatever's stored in the cloud? But I have no idea what's going on, and it's proving increasingly frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've seen the sync message for a few other apps: Netflix, Game of Thrones Telltale game, but nothing like this. Those synced briefly, and are now running fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cheers all! We managed to resolve this through a combination of advice here and the help of Xbox support chat.</p>
<p>This is what ended up working, for anyone who's having the same issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put the Xbox into offline mode (Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network settings &gt; Offline)
</li><li>Launch Fallout </li><li>Delete the backlog of saved games, other than the last few </li><li>Play Fallout for a few hours in offline mode.&nbsp; </li><li>Exit Fallout </li><li>Go back online </li><li>Launch Fallout </li></ol>
<p>We still had some syncing, but it was relatively quick and we were able to get into the game afterwards. We've had no problems since.</p>
<p>Xbox Support had suggested we'd have to do this step after number 7 above, but it wasn't an option that came up for us:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Once launchd, you will be asked what data you are going to sync, cloud data or offline data. Please select Cloud Storage Data.</span>
</li></ul>

<p>The reason Fallout 4 takes so long to sync is that the save files are huge, especially 9 days of play. You're looking at somewhere between 1.5-2GB of save files.
</p>
<p>I've found that the best solution is to disconnect from Xbox Live and load up a game offline. then delete as many saves as possible, keeping only the very last and if you need to, some at major branching points in the game if you think you'll want to play
 from them again. Then connect back to Xbox Live and exit the game. Then hopefully, when you load up the game again, it will remove most of the saves from the cloud and syncing should only take a few minutes.
</p>
<p>When you do this, be sure to do it for all characters if you have different playthroughs with alternate characters.

    <title>How to get rid of the hint boxes on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameswalter  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get rid of the hint boxes on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to get rid of the hint boxes on Windows 8.1. They look like a black square sometimes with a orange arrow giving hints on how to use Windows 8.1. The hints are blocking part of the screen and sometimes won't go away. For example it
 says to swipe in from the edge, but I am not using a touch enabled device. Swiping with a mouse does not get rid of it.<br />
<br />
Possible answer:<br />
I solved my own problem by logging in to my own desktop from a tablet and using the swipe gesture on the tablet and that got rid of the hint box. I haven't seen the hint box since then. You can use a program like Splashtop Streamer ( maybe TeamViewer) to do
 this if you have or can borrow a tablet.<br />

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
1. Does the hint boxes appear while using applications or features for the first time?<br />
2. Do the hint boxes repeat once an application or setting has been used?<br />
<br />
Hint boxes cannot be removed. this hint boxes comes when you use applications or features for the first time.

            <p>I believe you should be able to create/set:</p>
<p>* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EdgeUI</p>
<p>registry value name DisableHelpSticker type REG_DWORD to value "1".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that each sticker should be dismissed once you do that action once.&nbsp; If your system is incapable of doing the action suggested then your drivers are probably misreporting their capabilities.</p>

            the hint box is soooooo dumb. How could MS have on a basic install something that you have to search how to get rid of instead of just right clicking and deleting it. dumb dumb dum.&nbsp;

            <p>They should go away once you do the action specified.&nbsp; If you are unable to perform that action, then there is quite likely something wrong with your system.&nbsp; If for example you are getting a touch hint then that indicates that the system is being told that
 you have a touch device.&nbsp; The system is quite possibly in that case a victim of a bad driver on your system.</p>

            My problem was that it didn't go away when I did something. However, I rebooted and now it's gone. It should have had an X on the box like every other app does

            <p>I got rid of it on a girls touch screen HP laptop remotely by opening the Tiles screen and starting an app and dragging&nbsp;the top down and&nbsp;to the left side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting a second app and doing&nbsp;same...&nbsp; so I had two apps on left margin in suspend mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
 switching them back on one at a time ... fixed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>She was thinking she somehow screwed up the install.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never ever had even used apps at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to show her some basics on team viewer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said uninstall the HP supplied IObit Start8 I think it was called and gave her a little live demo for the
 tiles.... Here, watch me....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She likely will never use any tiles.&nbsp; Facebook and Yahoo &amp; Skype &amp; desktop games and free toolbars is about all she messes with ... all on the desktop.</p>

Zach,</p>
<p>We bought two new surface pro 2 and I have the same issues, it just sticks there regardless of the action, it especially annoying when you want to modify or change a setting and the area you want to click.</p>
<p>After an updated today I was able to swipe down from the upper left to the center to close it, other wise I was restarting every time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you find any device with yellow mark right on the device, click on properties to get the error message
 details and post back here. As a workaround you may try to uninstall the drivers for such devices and restart the computer. Restarting the computer might install the proper drivers for it.</span></p>
<p><span>To uninstall drivers from the device manager follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on
<b>Start</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “<b>Device Manager</b>” without quotes in the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on
<b>Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Select the device you wish to uninstall in the Device Manager window and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>e. You can also uninstall by right clicking on the device and selecting
<b>Uninstall</b> from the context menu. A dialog box will open asking if you really wish to uninstall the driver. Click
<b>Yes</b>, then <b>OK</b> in the next window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></b></p>

 and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

    <title>Congratulations on your new Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danqalicious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Congratulations on your new Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Today I got an e-mail congratulating me on my Xbox One. Cool, huh? Well I actually haven't bought one. I asked my wife if she had a surprise for me and she said no. Now, I checked out the e-mail headers and it looks like a legitimate e-mail from MS (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).
 But why would I get an e-mail like that?</p>
<p>I got excited thinking that MS was still giving out free consoles to loyal gamers, but I'm not sure that's what it is. Can anyone confirm for me why I got this e-mail and what I should do about it? I can provide an MS representative the e-mail, e-mail headers,
 and whatever else is necessary. I tried asking Xbox Support about this earlier on Twitter but they seem to have bailed on me.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this situation to our attention here on the forums. Can you provide us with a&nbsp; bit more information about this situation. Are there any error messages or codes that you get when trying to sign in. What do you mean you don't have a
 button to sign in to another account? Do you see an option that says "Sign Out"? Perhaps try fully powering down your device and then unplugging it from the power for a minute or two before trying again.
</p>
<p>Let us know with a reply how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get into windows 10 on my desktop, doesn&#39;t recognize my microsoft password</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is the worst program microsoft has ever rolled out. Had so many problems yesterday getting it installed then found out that my printer was messed up. Must have had to turn this piece of **** on and off 15 times in the last two days.
</p>
<p>Thought is was all finally stable. No the sign is showing up which i never had to do yesterday and it doesn't recognize my ms password which I just used to sign into this post on another computer. Anyone out here a lawyer, can't we start a class action suit
 against ms for loss of productivity caused by their incompetence?</p>

<h2>            How to fix corrupted RTF document&#63;</h2>
                    I woke up this morning to find out that two of my RTF files are corrupt. They open up perfectly fine but absolutely no text shows up and I'm unable to open then in any other word program, including Google Documents, to try and salvage my work. I was able
 to restore the files back to an earlier point, but in the process, I'm losing days worth of work.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a way to recover the text from the file?

            Hi,
<div><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>I can understand how frustrating it could be when things go unusual. I will certainly help you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please follow the methods mentioned below:<br />
Method 1: <br />
I suggest that you reset the Windows Store cache as per the below mentioned steps and check:
<br />
•&nbsp;Press Windows key and R key together to open the Run Window.<br />
•&nbsp;Type wsreset.exe and press Enter key for the command to execute.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:<br />
•&nbsp;You may try to run the in-built Windows Store app troubleshooter and check. Follow the steps:<br />
•&nbsp;Press Windows Key + X..<br />
•&nbsp;Click on Control Panel.<br />
•&nbsp;Select Troubleshooting.<br />
•&nbsp;On the left pane, click on View All.<br />
•&nbsp;Click on Windows Store apps to run the troubleshooter. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>1. Open Date and time settings -&gt; Switch off automatic date time.</p>
<div>2. Open Windows Store. If the problem still exists.</div>
<div>3. Go back to date time settings and switch on automatic date time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Delete the Store cache and re-launch again. Go to:</p>
<div>&nbsp;C:&gt;users -&gt; &lt;user_name&gt; -&gt; AppData -&gt; Local -&gt; Packages -&gt; Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\Local cache. and delete all the files and folders in there</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Let us know if the issue is resolved or if you require further assistance.</p>
        </p>

            HI SharonPettigrew ... what is the make and model of your PC.
<br />To get to keyboard settings go to search and type control panel and open it.
<br />Then search for Keyboard.
<br />Not much settings in windows for keyboards but your PC vendor might have a driver that has more keyboard settings.
<br />But when it comes to spacebar normally there isn't any settings... you just have to get used to it, i know not a great answer sorry.

 on my computer (is that normal for windows 10? &nbsp;Also, is "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege" &nbsp;is that normal?</span>

<h2>            Dual Monitor Problem in Windows 7&#58; 2nd monitor detected but black</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so I have a Dell that was running&nbsp;Vista and two monitors. When I upgraded to Windows 7 Pro I ran into the infamous black screen problem and fixed it. However, I only fixed my main monitor. When I open the display window, both of my monitors are detected
 but my secondary monitor shows a black screen and&nbsp;the monitor itself&nbsp;says there is no signal detected from my PC. The strange thing is&nbsp;my pc thinks its working (I can drag a window from my working monitor towards the black one and it moves out of my working
 monitor into the black screen).&nbsp;I currently have both of them plugged in using a DVI to VGA splitter and I have also updated the drivers by clicking the "Update Driver" button in the monitor properties window. Please help if you can!</p>

<p>It can only share with "app store apps" (also known as Universal Windows Apps). &nbsp;The old "Office" version of the apps don't have the programming to receive incoming shares (they were created before such sharing existed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As one workaround, you can share it to the stock OneNote and let it sync, then it will still show up inside the Office 2016 version too.</p>

<h2>            &#8220;Unable to connect to the Internet after installing Encore ENLWI-G2 NIC card&#8221;</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <span>Encore ENLWI-G2 and Windows 7</span></p>
<p>I used to have a small Belkin USB wireless adapter for me computer that's running Windows 7. Long story short, someone sat on the Belkin adapter and it died. So I bought an Encore ENLWI-G2 NIC. I installed the software, installed the hardware and what do
 I get? I'm detecting the network fine, I can begin connecting just fine. However, it's amazing to get it to connect to the network at all, let alone to the internet. Long story short, I can sometimes connect to the network, but I can never connect to the internet.
 I'm currently on a computer using the same router (obviously it works like a charm). I've tried manually configuring the IP address, Default Gateway, Subnet Mask, and DNS Servers, which helped for all of 30 seconds. I tried going back to auto configuring all
 these, and it came up with an IP that didn't even belong to my router. I called Encore (Poor customer support, even if it is 24/7. I have nothing against Indians, but it's impossible to understand them over a phone call, and the guy I was talking to didn't
 even know that you could access the Device Manager by right clicking My Computer from the start menu. I felt like I was teaching rather than being helped.)</p>
<p>In short... Help me get this hardware connected?</p>

<p><span>Hi TheKyngArthur,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens if you bypass the router to connect to the Internet directly? Will you be able to connect just fine?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try to connect to the Internet? Do you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 anti-virus software is currently installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run Internet Connection troubleshooter in Windows 7</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span><strong>Provide network troubleshooter
 event logs</strong></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Disable your anti-virus software and then try to connect to the internet</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span><em>Running the computer without firewall
 or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance</span></p>

<br />You can not use the button. Is this correct?
