            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I&nbsp;understand that your Dell backup and recovery manager is not working. The above application was provided&nbsp;by the computer's manufacturer, that is, Dell OEM. If you are referring to the backup and recovery drive that was created by
 the OEM, then, I suggest that you provide the exact error code and message that you have received. Also, send a screenshot for the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so as the recovery drive will play an important role if you wish to revert back to the OS that was installed during the purchase of the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you contact their support forum as they will be better equipped to help you with your issue.
</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is called Aero Snap. &nbsp;When you select a Window how are you "snapping" it into position? &nbsp;Do you use the Window Key and the Left/Right arrow or are you dragging and dropping the window? &nbsp;If you are dragging and dropping, does using the keyboard shortcuts
 help resolve the issue?</p>

    <title>Windows 7 taskbar tasks not working at all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tenshikasai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 taskbar tasks not working at all</h2>
                    <p>When I got my computer for my birthday, it only took&nbsp;about&nbsp;6&nbsp;days and my Windows 7 taskbar stopped working the way I want it to. Here's how to replicate what I am doing;</p>
<p>1. Right click any program you want in the taskbar.</p>
<p>2. Under the "tasks" list hit any command.</p>
<p>3. Nothing else happens, but a command is supposed to happen, like how in IE9, Start InPrivate Browsing would open on a working computer, but it doesn't on mine.</p>
<p>My computer&nbsp;specs:</p>
<p>Satellite P775-S7320</p>
<p>(OS) MS Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1 (I used anytime upgrade)</p>
<p>(CPU) Intel Core i7 2720QM&nbsp; @ 2.20GHz</p>
<p>(RAM) 8.00 GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 665MHz (9-9-9-24)</p>
<p>(Graphics) Generic PnP Monitor</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Live Display Driver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel(R) HD Graphics Family</p>
<p>(HDD) 488GB Seagate ST95005620AS (SATA) (SeaGate Monentus XT 500GB)</p>
<p>(Disc Drive) MATSHITA BD-CMB UJ141EF (BD-ROM)</p>
<p>(Audio) Realtek High Definition Audio</p>
<p>P.S. I copied these specs from Speccy from Piriform and added some simplified names in case&nbsp;the original ones are&nbsp;too hard to understand</p>
<p>DO NOT RECOMMEND sfc /scannow, clearing the jump lists from taskbar properties, or anything else you can see in the first 5 pages when searching for "Windows 7 taskbar tasks problem", "Windows 7 taskbar not working", or "Windows 7 taskbar jumplist not working"
 on Google, Yahoo, Ask, or Bing. I tried for weeks to find it out on those search engines, please don't repeat those "solutions", they all do not work on my computer.</p>
<p>I use mostly microsoft software and all my defaults are set to microsoft only, if that helps you in any way.</p>
<p>On the first day I installed HP Imaging Device Functions 14.0, HP Smart Web Printing 4.60, HP Solution Center 14.0, Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile, Microsoft IntelliPoint 8.2, Microsoft IntelliType 8.2, Shop for HP Supplies, HP Photosmart C4700
 All-in-One Driver Software 14.0 Rel. 6, Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010, Windows XP Mode, Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x86 Redistributable - 10.0.30319, Bing Bar, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x64 9.0.30729.6161, Microsoft Visual C++ 2005
 Redistributable, MSXML 4.0 SP2 (KB954430), Microsfot Silverlight, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x86 9.0.30729.6161, WIDCOMM Bluetooth Software, Microsoft Xbox 360 Accessories 1.2, MSXML 4.0 SP2 (KB973688).</p>
<p>On the second day I installed Adobe Reader X (10.1.1) MUI</p>
<p>On the third day I installed Memeo LifeAgent Explorer Extension, Memeo Premium Backup</p>
<p>On the fifth day I installed Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1, Bing Maps 3D</p>
<p>I started to get accustomed to my new computer on the 6th day and that's when I realized that the taskbar is not working correctly, and of course it is the first time I did that action, so I have no exact idea when the taskbar stopped working.</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

            I know exactly why my problem started now. When I installed Memeo Premium Backup, it changed something in the windows powershell, which corrupted the taskbar's task commands. I could tell because when I decided I no longer needed Memeo Premium Backup anymore,
 I&nbsp;went to uninstall it. As I watched the uninstall, it said "undoing changes to powershell". Once it finished, I tried to use the task commands in my taskbar, and it worked. So anything that changes the powershell will corrupt the taskbar's task commands.
 I am sorry for taking up so much of your time, but thanks for all the tips you gave me, they could&nbsp;come in handy&nbsp;later on if I have a similar problem.

            <p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will allow you reinstall Windows 7 while keeping genuine.</p>
<p>Make sure you backup your data before reinstalling:</p>

<p>Ok,&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here is the rub, supposedly Xbox One has a gigabit ethernet card in it according to the specs right? Well, Yes I am one of the lucky ones for has access to Google's brand new gigabit fiber service, here I am all excited to play
 games and download new games at blazing fast speeds! Well everyone in the community that is a load of BS! I have run the network speed test on the Xbox One and I only get nowhere near gigabit speeds. In fact I get between 130 and 180 Mbps download and between
 100-200 Mbps Upload speeds! This is absolute BS! I pay good money and have been a loyal Xbox fan since the very beginning of the console starting with Gen 1. &nbsp;After this disappointment I honestly can say that I am thinking of saying goodbye to Microsoft FOREVER!
 I had a friend bring over his PS4 and I did the same speed test and I was getting 900 Mbps DL and 945 Mbps UL! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless Microsoft can give me a really good answer to this question, I will be telling every single one of my friends in my area to take your Xbox One back to a gamestop and pick up a PS4!!</p>
<p>Thought the community ought to know this for sure!</p>

<p>Google Fiber is a relatively new technology so that's why Xbox still doesn't have support for it. That's still blazing fast! In any game that requires a host, you would be one so don't worry. The only problem you could have is maybe a 20 minute download
 here and there. If there is any other way I could help you stay with Microsoft, I'd be honored. If you'd like to talk to Xbox Live support directly refer to

<p>VenomousSIRE,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Truly I do appreciate the response, but that is not why I am really upset, getting right to the point, Microsoft has advertised in its specifications that it is a gigabit ethernet card in the Xbox One system. &nbsp;Why on earth does a company
 advertise such a fact and then you can not get the results? That is insanity! or at the very least false advertising. I know that Xbox Live does not limit download speeds so either they are not telling the community the truth that is ethernet controller is
 not really a gigabit capable ethernet card or something else is slowing down the connection. &nbsp;As for being host in games, your absolutely right for the most part I will be hosting any game that uses a peer to peer connection and thats fine with me. &nbsp;Honestly
 I never cared about host anyway, I just wanted to see Xbox One and Microsoft live up to what they are advertising to myself and the rest of the loyal Xbox Consumers out in the community who have supported this and every other Xbox console since Gen 1.</p>

<p>I feel you man but I feel like every single company over-exaggerates their product may it be the Xbox One, the Wii-U, the PS4, your always going to find that they over hype their products and that they always have problems. You have to weigh the positives
 and the negatives.</p>

<p>So I ran some network tests on mine and had no issues. Throughput is all in normal ranges for a gigabit connection. There are many factors that affect throughput. Even your router could work well with one card and not as well with another for many reasons.
 On average 300 to 400 mbit/sec is normal. Which my PC gigabit is averaging. My Xbox one average 680 mbit/sec. &nbsp;With spikes up to 880. so the actual network card speed is perfectly normal when transferring data. That said I do find alot of ms downloads are
 slow, and almost feel like they are being throttled back. Yet other downloads are lightning quick and use the full bandwidth available. I would try a few other things, or possibly a defective card, hard to say.

<p>Exodus,</p>
<p>Yeah man I am thinking that the speeds are being throttled and I do feel that the console that I have might seriously have a defective network card in it. &nbsp;I brought that to the attention of Xbox Support and they told me that they would bump up the issue
 to global support and that I would hear something back within 48 hours of course that is business hours. &nbsp;So far it has been 72 hours with no email from the MS Global Support team. &nbsp;Why am I not surprised!

<p>VaudeVillan,</p>
<p>I have every single one of those ports open. Double checked all of them and still having the network speed tests give me slow speeds for having google fiber. &nbsp;So, Yes I am really thinking that it is a defective network card. &nbsp;Xbox support if you are monitoring
 this thread, have the global support team ACTUALLY send me an email and get me a new Xbox One if you really want to keep a loyal customer. &nbsp;Otherwise, the slighted feeling that I have been experiencing for the last week just keeps getting worse.</p>

<p>If you think there is something wrong with it then set up a repair or exchange, it's all the global support team is really going to do anyway. &nbsp;If your network card was defective then I doubt you'd be getting the speeds you're getting now. &nbsp;I know with most
 connections you're going to see a lot of degradation from the wall to your machine, depending on the quality of your equipment. &nbsp;For instance I have Comcast and pay for 75Mbps but by the time it makes it through that cheapo modem they give you and my bargain
 bin wireless adaptor I have, even sitting right next to the router, I'm averaging about 30Mbps. &nbsp;There are things that the networking team can do that can help open your ports and set you behind a cone NAT and what not that may show an improvement, but at
 the end of the day, once you pass that couple hundred mark and your lat is low, you really start seeing diminishing returns on you speed. &nbsp;Not that that info helps your situation, but it's something to bear in mind.</p>
<p>Short version, if you think something is wrong then log into your account at myservice.xbox.com and set yourself up with a repair or exchange after registering your system, or give them a call at 800-4-MY-XBOX and have support set it up for you.</p>

<p>Guessing you are connecting your Xbox One to the modem directly and via cable and that cable is Cat6 and not Cat5 or Cat5e as the later two are more common but don't support gigabit connections. You will need Cat6 cable for that.</p>
<p>If you aren't plugged directly into the modem and are going through a router you will need a Cat6 between the console and the router and then another Cat6 from router to modem.
</p>
<p>As with anything on the Internet, all speeds are hypothetical and may not be the speed you actually get.</p>

<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m a Xbox preview user and game share isn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t working </h2>
                    I recently installed over watch and subnautica expecting it to automatically download on my little brothers' so Xbox . Keep in mind I'm game sharing with him. He ended up not getting the games, I checked on "ready to install" and "game queue" and it still
 wasn't there. I then went on to my brothers xbox( my home Xbox) and signed in on my account, I then went to the Xbox store to check the digitally downloaded games (overwatch and subnautica) they were not purchased for some reason. I think it's the preview
 program and if so, if I leave it will things go back to normal Ps I signed my brother up for the preview program to see if it would work, I think I'm going to delete it

            <p>It is my personal opinion only .......</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;It is generally accepted&nbsp;that there are 10% of world population left-handed.
<br />
How many business enterprises will make an effort to tailor-made for minority sector ?</p>
<p>2. Unless there is a huge public demand , and there isn't any out-cry of such,&nbsp;a patch is unlikely.</p>
<p>So much for my 2 cents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a " tweak " for Firefox browser which&nbsp; can put scroll bar to the left.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Office Word and Excel have an option to move scroll bar to the left by enabling " right to left language setting ", such as Arabic. Once right to left language setting is enable, an option to move scroll bar to the left is available.</p>

    <title>Devices Connecting and Disconnecting- Nothing in Event Logs to Show - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Devices Connecting and Disconnecting- Nothing in Event Logs to Show Error</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Like many, many, many other people, my USB devices disconnect and reconnect- in particular my mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>It seems to be an error related to USB 3.0, but it occurs both on my USB expansion card, on my front USB ports, and on my back USB ports.<br />
Unfortunately, I can't switch to Linux because some software I need to use runs only on Windows and doesn't work well in a VM.</p>
<p>So here we are, trying to fix it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running EventGhost, I can track what is happening with the disconnect and reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>22:24:45&nbsp;&nbsp; System.DeviceRemoved [u'\\\\?\\HID#VID_1BCF&amp;PID_0005#9&amp;2e0f0b30&amp;0&amp;0000#{4d1e55b2-f16f-11cf-88cb-001111000030}']<br />
22:24:45&nbsp;&nbsp; System.DeviceRemoved [u'\\\\?\\USB#VID_1BCF&amp;PID_0005#8&amp;78ed0ff&amp;0&amp;4#{a5dcbf10-6530-11d2-901f-00c04fb951ed}']<br />
22:24:46&nbsp;&nbsp; System.DeviceAttached [u'\\\\?\\USB#VID_1BCF&amp;PID_0005#8&amp;78ed0ff&amp;0&amp;4#{a5dcbf10-6530-11d2-901f-00c04fb951ed}']<br />
22:24:46&nbsp;&nbsp; System.DeviceAttached [u'\\\\?\\HID#VID_1BCF&amp;PID_0005#9&amp;2e0f0b30&amp;0&amp;0000#{4d1e55b2-f16f-11cf-88cb-001111000030}']</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this doesn't actually help me fix the error.</p>
<p>I can't figure out what is causing the disconnect and reconnect, and I can't find anything in the Windows logs about it.</p>
<p>Nothing unusual happens before or after.<br />
It happens both in intensive applications and out.<br />
But it only happens to my mouse and keyboard- which is a shame because if it happened only to any *other* device I'd be ok.<br />
<br />
How do I track down the error that is causing this?<br />
Where would this end up in the event logs?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            Hi Adm,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1 - Check your power management settings 
<br />Windows Key + X &gt; Click on Device Manager &gt; Expand the Universal Serial Bus controllers &gt; Double-click the first USB Root Hub device in the list, and click the Power Management tab &gt; Un-check the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power checkbox &amp; OK &gt; Do this for other USB Root Hub devices if listed
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />2 - Disable and enable USB controllers
<br />Windows Key + X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Universal Serial Bus controllers &gt; Right click on each entry beneath this one by one and Uninstall &gt; Reboot your computer to automatically install these
<br />
<br />3 - Reset BIOS to Default Settings (Do it if you little bit tech savy)
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />Depending upon your computer, you have to press a particular Function Key. When your computer restarts, it will display which key
<br />Once you are into BIOS, you set it to default
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />(A good helpful guide for resetting BIOS - <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>)
<br />
<br />4. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hey Vijay,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response!<br />
I've already tried all of those and the problem persists.<br />
This is why I'm trying to figure out the underlying cause.<br />
<br />
I have:</p>
<p>1. Fixed all power management</p>
<p>2. Updated and uninstalled and reinstalled all drivers</p>
<p>3. Reset BIOS</p>
<p>4. Reinstalled a fresh copy of Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I actually debug the problem rather than the shotgun approach which is getting me nowhere?</p>
<p>

    <title>How do you hide a user account in Windows 8 and add an &#34;Other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saxlover98  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you hide a user account in Windows 8 and add an &#34;Other User&#34; icon to the Windows 8 user account list&#63;</h2>
                    I'm running <i>Windows 8 Pro</i> on my laptop, and I wanted to set up a hidden account and add a "Other User" box to the
<i>Windows</i> login selection. I have seen this done before, but I can't seem to get it worked out. I ended up not being able to hide the account after trying a couple of things from online. I saw the "Interactive logon: Do not display last user name" policy
 in Local Security Policy panel, but it hides every user account on the computer behind a classic logon prompt. I don't want all of them hidden, because I have two other users who can't remember their username. I just want it to have a button to click for it
 on the user list. Can someone please help me out with this problem. Thanks.

<h2>            Offline Files Network Shares Stays Offline</h2>
                    <p>I use offline files to keep my files on a network drive and sync selected files onto my laptop. I was able to setup the offline files and select the files that I want to sync. &nbsp;Everything worked for about a week and then I noticed that the network drive
 shows offline even though I have connectivity to it. &nbsp;This prevents me from synching the files I have changed to the network drive as windows thinks the network drive is offline, so now my laptop is out of synch with the network drive. &nbsp;I cannot even get to
 the network drive through Windows Explorer even though I know that I have connectivity and permissions. &nbsp;I only get connected to the offline version of the drive on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to do this twice and got it to work twice only to find the same behavior after about a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on what I can do to fix this?</p>

 supposed to be the one with the questions. I'm very frustrated.</p>

<p>Yeah I understand that y'all are very upset but I have the answer to solve this! It's basically a glitch! What u need to do is hold the X on the Xbox for 5 secs to make it shut off! Unplug it for about 1 min and let it reboot! Then that should fix the problem!
