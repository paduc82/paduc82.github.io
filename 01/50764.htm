<h2>            Birthday Rewards</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering why I never received an email on my birthday December 18th about any Myvip perks/gems that I was under the assumption came with the "new" MyVip. My gamertag is LibLabNeoCon if you need that information.</p>

    <title>Win 10 File Explorer search for file names that include special - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xian555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 File Explorer search for file names that include special characters</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the programs I use create temporary file or files.&nbsp; Of course, typically, most programs create a working copy of a file with a temporary name, to preserve the original in case of crash.&nbsp; But more programs now create more types of temporary files,
 some hidden, some not hidden.&nbsp; For example, in a multi-user environment many programs now create a ...?????lock.????.... file as a signal or indicator that the file is presently being edited by another user.&nbsp; This for programs and files that do not have the
 ability to allow multiple users to work on the same file at the same time, like in the case of certain spreadsheet or database programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now usually, after a file is saved, and/or closed, temporary and permanent files are updated, and the temporary files erased.&nbsp; In my present case I have a long list of "lock" files, some of which I want to erase that I recognize which program produced them
 and for some reason did not erase these files on exit.&nbsp; Other "lock" files are produced by an archival program and I do not want to erase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are several examples of typical names of "lock" files I wish to erase : &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>.~lock.243-402-VM Strategie Automatisation - PdC xm H12-256c914f65d0748afbcd0110d03a4924.docx#</li><li>.~lock.243-602-VM - Reconnaissance des situations à risques pour la S&amp;ST - CAM&nbsp; 2012-mai-8b.pdf#</li><li>.~lock.Liste des cours.xls#</li><li>lock</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are two examples of "lock" files I do not wish to erase :</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase Locked Loop (a directory name)</li><li>lock_icon.gif</li><li>LOCKVL.LCK</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Results for a search on "lock" (i.e. <em>lock</em> with no quotes), with restriction on search only file name, produces a list of all files with those letters, and the search results are not case sensitive.&nbsp; The following questions ensue :</p>
<p>1) how to make a search case sensitive</p>
<p>2) searching for ~<em>lock</em>&nbsp; or with quotes <em>"~lock</em>" produces the same results as a search for&nbsp;<em>lock</em>
</p>
<p>3) searching for "lock."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is there a decent online manual one can consult?&nbsp; So that use of blogs, with the unavoidable delay for a response, or worse, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy 2018 !!</p>

    <title>Supernatural Season 3 incomplete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelmire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Supernatural Season 3 incomplete</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, my gamertag is Kelmire - I recently purchased Season 3 of Supernatural at full price(Over 3,000 points) and half the season is missing. There's only 8/16 episodes available and not in chronological order.<br />
<br />
I have encountered a similar problem with the movie 'The Island' with half of the content missing.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I'm very tired of paying over the full retail price on Xboxs' ridiculously overpriced products, merely to be given half the product. I demand either a refund or that you fix this issue immediately - you've essentially stolen money from me and I would
 regard this as nothing less than fraud.</p>

    <title>Logging into Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgemccord-craven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logging into Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I get the initial login screen, shows my two accounts correctly, so I am trying to log in with my password for the account shown and it does not happen. I get a response of "Your device is offline, Please sign in with the last password used on this device."
 So I click "OK" and I have used every password in my knowledge base and none of them activate this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 took 2 days to do the initial load, maybe I got a faulty copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there is no reason for the device to be offline. I am sitting right next to the router and it is working perfectly.</p>
<p>I click on the internet icon the right bottom corner and it tells me "Networks&nbsp; No connections are available."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what happened and how can I resolve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaiting your reply on pins and needles. </p>
<p>I need this laptop back up, I am using my desktop in another part of the house to post this&nbsp;and it has a very good internet connection.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Sara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice, it seemed to resolve the issue of the internet connection. Sitting right next to the router and&nbsp;used the wired connection&nbsp;and the connection worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplugged from the wired connection and tried it again. The software could not find the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So plugged back in, waited for the connection to show connected and tried to log in. I did not get any error message number but I got the response of</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The "User Profile Service" service failed the Sign-in."</p>
<p>"User Profile cannot be loaded."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, HELP, I definitely do not want to lose all my data because I tried backing up my files to three different areas and they all failed. 1 was to iCloud, next was to external HDD and the third was to another computer over the network connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and God Bless&nbsp;to you and all the members of the forum for the help you are providing to all us.</p>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to any missing or corrupted System files that are related to the user account. I would like to know some information about this issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Are you facing this issue with a Microsoft Account?</p>
<p>2. What type of Windows 10 installation did you perform? (Is it an Upgrade or Clean Installation?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an Installation or Recovery Media, then try booting to Safe Mode with Command Prompt using the media and then try enabling Built-in Administrator account using the following command:</p>
<p><strong>net user administrator /<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcvgsharepoint%2f_layouts%2fimages%2fblank.gif" />active:yes</strong> (To disable Built –in Administrator account give the command Active: No).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Built-in Administrator account create a new user account and copy the data files from&nbsp;old user account (Account that has sign in issues) and delete the corrupted user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> If the new user profile works properly, then copy and paste the data files to the new user profile.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to copy the files from the old Microsoft account to the new Microsoft account:

            Hi Lax,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hello Lax, I recommend you to perform a hard shut down twice. For this, start your PC and when you see spinning dots, press and hold the power button for 5-10 sec. When you start up your PC for the third time, Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment where you will get an access to such functions as System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt etc.
<br />Try these options one at a time to see if Windows will boot
<br />-Go to Troubleshoot, try Advanced Option, then Startup Repair. Window must repair itself.
<br />-Then Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore. (you can go back to restore point).
<br />-If there is no restore point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />-After, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />-In the Safe Mode, you can back up your data
<br />Then open Device Manager to make sure that you are using current Drivers.
<br />Restart to see if Windows will start properly. If not, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - reset this PC. Select to keep your files and apps or to keep nothing and then press Reset

            Try simply forcing your machine to shut down by holding the power button and rebooting to see if you can get in.
<br />
<br />If that does not work then you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.

            Hi Lax 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your frozen Windows 10 system.
<br />
<br />If your computer does not start up, start your computer/laptop in Windows Recovery Mode.  
<br />
<br />1.)	Turn on your computer/laptop, as soon as you see Windows starting to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button until it shuts down.  (Do this two times)
<br />2.)	On the third time to power up, Windows should start up in Recovery Mode
<br />3.)	You will see several options System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt… select Safe Mode
<br />4.)	If are able to go in Safe Mode, go to Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced Option-&gt; Startup Repair
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t work, keep going through the same process selecting a different option each time. . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same problem, Cortana responds "Shuffling your music, and a few seconds later says, "Something went wrong, try again in a little bit".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked that the Cortana.cpl file is in my Music\Playlist folder and it will play if I click on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has worked ever since Cortana became available in the Insider Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's a network problem, my settings are all correct and I don't have any problems with my connection even through Cortana, if I ask her to search for something she finds it with quickly.</p>

            I have this same problem. My music is all on OneDrive but there is no Cortana.cpl file in my Playlist folder. I can play music just fine by directly launching Groove or WMP. I just can't get Cortana to do it for me. Maybe that's not in her contract?

            Cortana just says "Something went wrong. Please try again later." However today I said "Hey Cortana, play some Led Zeppelin" and she started Xbox Music and queued up my Zeppelin songs with no problem. I'm not sure what changed but it's working now.

            <p>Saw the update to this thread and thought I'd check out Cortana's music ability again. The first time I said "Hey Cortana, play some music." she replied, "OK queuing up your music" and launched Groove with my music randomized into the "Now playing" play
 list. Ok, so far, so good. I then said "Hey Cortana, play some Led Zeppelin" and Cortana switched to Groove (which was still playing the initial selections) but nothing happened. So I closed Groove and tried again, still nothing. Tried "Hey Cortana, play some
 Pink Floyd" -- she opened Groove and queued up my Pink Floyd music. Tried Led Zeppelin again but still nothing. I tried a couple of other commands and Cortana eventually started confusing "Play some Led Zeppelin" with weather related queries, at one point
 telling me the current temperature. Now the Zeppelin imperative simply makes Cortana freeze for&nbsp;a bit. I tried Al Stewart (played OK), Gerry Rafferty (played ok and even stopped the Al Stewart track and switched to Rafferty), Asia (switched OK from Rafferty).
 Tried Zeppelin again, nothing. Tried Jimmy Page, she queued up Page's albums. So I guess she just doesn't like Zeppelin.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All jest aside, I suspect there is corruption with the Groove database. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>It's too bad you can't use System Restore - that would be the quickest and easist way to fix this problem.&nbsp; I recommend you turn System Restore back on and immediately make a restore point.</p>
<p>In which of the Desktop folders are your desktop items (or are they in each folder)?&nbsp; I would find a folder with all your desktop icons in it and copy&nbsp;it to a new folder called "Old Desktop) and put it in your Documents folder just to be on the safe side
 - so you have a copy to go bacck to if something goes wrong while you're trying to fix the problem. &nbsp;You can then &nbsp;try deleting the three extras (or the ones with no entries starting at the bottom one in the file path) one at a time (checking the others each
 time to make sure they still contain your desktop icons).&nbsp; Once you get to the last one check again to be sure it contains all your desktop items and then reboot.&nbsp; Hopefully that will repair the multiple instances of Desktop icons.&nbsp; If it doesn't, read on.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work or if you prefer, you can treat the situation like a corrupted user profile.&nbsp;
<span>To fix this use
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can't remember the password, try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Make sure you have at least two Administrator profiles with strong passwords (that you will remember) along with your standard user profile
 for daily use.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since people often try to hack into systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose
 the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>Since Microsoft stopped making the Wireless Racing Wheel I don't know if they are still able to supply the clamp as a replacement part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can still try to ask by contacting the official support at <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> and ask them if they still have the clamp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, your only sources would be eBay or stores that specialize in used hardware.
</p>
<p>However, chances of getting the clamp only are pretty slim, as usually the hardware is sold with the clamp.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HEVC&#47;10bit Error</h2>
                    Every time I have a folder with HEVC x265 videos I get a error message, I attached a image showing the error I get. I'm not sure what the issue is, it only happens when I open a folder with that kind of video format. Any insight would be appreciated.

<div>Hi Moleburt,</div>
<div><br />
There could be a number of factors as to why you are experiencing with opening the video file. This could be caused by corrupted system file or an issue with the app you are using to open the file.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know more about your concern. Kindly tell us which application you are using to open the video file. Is this the first time that you will open the said video file? Have you tried opening the file using another video player app? Are you experiencing
 this issue with all the file with the HEVC x265 format?</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you run the System File Checker and DISM tool. The <strong>
Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM)</strong> is a utility&nbsp; that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from a cached version that’s on your PC. If DISM can’t replace
 the files, the System File Checker (SFC) can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em>. Right-click the result, and then select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Copy or type each command followed by hitting <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</strong></em></li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You can also perform a clean boot. A <strong>clean boot</strong> will help eliminates software conflicts that occur when you install a program, update, or when you run a program in Windows 10. For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the provided link to return your computer to normal startup mode.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed.</p>

<p>I ran both of the Command Prompt commands and it didn't change anything. But I think you misunderstood slightly, the error doesn't occur when I try to play a video file of this type, it occurs when I open a folder containing video files of this format, no
 playing of the video is involved, the files play fine when I try to use them, but the error pops up anytime I open a folder containing this format of video. I will also try a clean boot and if that changes anything I will reply to the thread again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nick</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update - ran the Clean boot, no change to the error occurring when opening folders containing video files in this format.</p>

<p>An issue with the&nbsp; COM Surrogate process could also trigger the error that you are getting. You can close the COM Surrogate using Task Manager. To do this, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> key to open <strong>Task Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under the <strong>Processes</strong> tab, right-click the <strong>COM Surrogate
</strong>process and then select <strong>End task</strong>. If you can't find the COM Surrogate process in the Processes tab, then you can go to
<strong>Details</strong> tab and look for <strong>dllhost.exe</strong>. Right-click
<strong>dllhost.exe</strong>&nbsp; and then choose <strong>End Task</strong>.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if iPod gets detected in Device Manager,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>Device Manager</b> and hit Enter.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the plus (+) icon (or disclosure triangle ( ) for Windows 7) next to
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers </b>to expand this selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Locate the iPod in this list. In some cases one of the entries will have "iPod" in its name. If no such entries are present, the iPod is most likely represented by "USB Mass Storage
 Device."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer the following articles for more information:</p>

                    <p>Most of the time for the past three to five times (over a long time, not sure how much or if it even matters) that I've signed out of my account (computer), the computer restarted instead of signed out. Luckily, no one else's account was open or had any

            Troubleshooting startup problems can be difficult because every PC is set up differently. Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems. Startup repair can detect and fix problems that prevent your PC from starting.
<br />
Try this <br />
<br />
Startup repair should automatically start on its own and try to fix the problem. If Startup Repair doesn’t start on its own, here’s how to open the System Recovery Options menu:
<ol>
<li>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer; swipe from the right or press the Windows + C keys to open the Charms bar. Next, tap or click
<b>Settings</b>, and then tap or click <b>Change PC Settings</b>, and then select
<b>General. </b>Under Advanced startup, tap or click the <b>Restart now </b>button.</li><li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>If your computer has a songle operating system</b>, Chose an opiton will appear.</li><li><b>If your computer has more than one operation system</b>, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then Chose an opiton will appear.
</li></ul>
</li><li>On Choose an option screen, tap or click on <b>Troubleshoot</b>, <b>Advanced options</b>, and then
<b>Automatic Repair.</b></li></ol>

            check the HDD first with chkdsk . Also delete the old transaction data from the folder: C:\Windows\System32\config\TxR.

    <title>Why has my computer stopped being able to connect to the internet via - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> perpetual office newbie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why has my computer stopped being able to connect to the internet via my home wifi &#40;only&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 7 machine, which has been wirelessly connecting to the internet via my home network without trouble for a long time, has suddenly become unable to reach the internet in this way. I can still connect to my wireless network, but Windows identifies
 it as an "Unidentified network" with "No Internet access".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can connect to the internet using my home network using a wired (ethernet cable) connection.</li><li>I can connect to the internet using public wifi spots at restaurants and cafes (including those requiring passwords).</li><li>Other devices in my house (e.g., smart phones, tablets, Roku box) continue to reach the internet via my wireless home network.</li><li>Guests who come over have no trouble accessing the internet via my wifi network.</li></ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>There have been no configuration changes or software updates made to my router (D-Link DIR-655).</li><li>None of the Windows Network Diagnostics troubleshooter, the Windows Internet Connections troubleshooter and the Windows Network Adapter troubleshooter are able to resolve the problem.</li><li>Rebooting the machine and the router doesn't solve the problem.</li></ul>
<p>Any suggestions on how I can fix this issue?</p>

<h2>            Potentially harmful files blocked</h2>
                    
<p>Windows XP Pro with SP3 and outlook express.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I can no longer access any attachments.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if they're .pdf's or .doc or whatever.&nbsp; I get the dialog "Windows found that this file is potentially harmful.&nbsp; To help protect your computer, Windows has blocked access to the file."</p>
<p>There is no "unblock" option when right clicking, nor is there the option to "copy" and "paste".</p>
<p>I've searched this extensively over the last few days, tried many of the solutions recommended (most were very old and pre-SP3) but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>I've tried forwarding the email to myself, but it's still blocked.&nbsp; I can forward to another machine and open it, but that's too inconvenient.</p>
<p>And yes, tools/options/security - "do not allow ..." is unchecked.</p>
<p>I've also tried disabling windows firewall, but that didn't work either, nor did adding OE to firewall exceptions.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Edit:&nbsp; Just deleted AVG to see if it makes a difference and no change.&nbsp; The dialog that pops up clearly says "Windows found a problem".&nbsp; I've seen a lot of references to this in searches, but it was usually with older versions around 2006.&nbsp; And as I said,
 I'm on XP Pro SP3.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would recommend you to do these:<br />
1. Reboot the computer in Safe Mode with Networking. If you have a Wireless Internet Connection Type, have a hardwire internet connection. To reboot in Safe Mode with networking:<br />
&nbsp;a. Press the restart button.<br />
&nbsp;b. The moment you press the restart button, keep on &nbsp;tapping F8 until the Advanced Boot Options appear.<br />
&nbsp;C. Select Safe Mode with Networking<br />
2. Open Internet Explorer browser and go to <a href="http://safety.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://safety.live.com</a>.<br />
3. Run a Full Service Scan of the OneCare Safety Scanner.<br />
4. Take note of the items that are detected but cannot be removed, if any. Get back to me with the names of infections that cannot be removed, if any.<br />
5. After removing the infections (if any), boot back in the Normal Mode by simply restarting the computer the normal way you do it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I first got my laptop, I could use Aero and my Taskbar would change colors whenever I wanted to change it. I got a virus somehow from a thing I downloaded online, and now I can't make my laptop Aero and I can't change my Taskbars colors anymore.</p>

<p>I have troubleshooted it a few times, and here's what comes up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current theme doesn't support Aero</p>

<p><span>Hi Hammyobob,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seems like virus infection has taken its toll. The following suggestion may help you get back Aero on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>This section, method, or task
 contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify
 it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the windows help article below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Back up the registry</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Steps to follow:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start and type regedit.exe.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Navigate
 to the following registry key:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 the DWM registry key is not found, right click on Windows and then select&nbsp; <strong>
New</strong> -&gt; <strong>Key</strong> to create new branch and name it as&nbsp;<strong>DWM</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the right details pane, create a new DWORD (32-bit value) named&nbsp; <strong>UseMachineCheck</strong>, and set its value to 0.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In
 the right details pane, create a new&nbsp; <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong> named<strong>Blur</strong>, and set its value to 0.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In
 the right details pane, create a new&nbsp; <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong> named<strong>Animations</strong>, and set its value to 0.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Restart
 the&nbsp; <strong>Desktop Window Manager Session Manager</strong> in Services in Control Panel (type Services.msc in Start Search), or run the following commands in a&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Command-Prompt-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>command
 prompt with administrator privileges</span></a>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>net stop uxsms</span></strong><span><br />
<strong>net start uxsms</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Attempt
 to enable and apply Windows Aero in Windows 7. Restart the computer if required.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>That should be it.</span></p>

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<p>
</p></ol>
</ol>
<p>1) What is the make and model of the printer?</p>
<p>2) Are you getting any error message when you try to print?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to make printer as a default printer you can follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows key+ X</strong> and select <strong>
device manager</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select <strong>devices and printers</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the <strong>printer</strong> you want to use, and then click
<strong>set as default printer</strong> (You'll see a check mark on the printer's icon signifying that it's now your default printer).</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>I also recommend you to run the print troubleshooter to check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1) Type
<strong>troubleshooter</strong> in the search box and then press enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) In the left pane click on View all.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3) Select the printer option and follow the on screen instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps. Please reply to us with the status of the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
