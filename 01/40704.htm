<p>
</p><p>each day I regularly get a windows security pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it asks me to connect to various email addresses that I have used on &nbsp;the computer. but every time I try to enter the password it is rejected&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>see this link for a pic of the pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://tinypic.com/r/33xg18j/9</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone know how to stop this from appearing or what it relates to?</p>

            <p>I was getting this prompt and what fixed it for me was to remove the account from the mail accounts in Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel, User accounts, and choose Mail (Microsoft Outlook XXX) (32-bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click "Show profiles..." and remove all profiles that you don't need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, the password was being asked for one of those profiles. The account had been deleted on the server, so it would not stop asking me for that password. Not sure if that is your case, but I'm pretty certain that this would fix your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to the root cause of the problem, it seems that the Search Indexer is trying to index everything that your Outlook client has access to, which would include all those accounts that you ever accessed. If that's the case, then you get yet another reason
 to do a profile cleanup, especially if you aren't going to access those accounts anymore. It's just wasting resources on your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<p>How is the disk formatted?&nbsp; FAT-16 (2GB limit), FAT32 (4 GT limite), or NTFS (no real limit though there may be one depending on the amount of RAM and virtual spac e you hvave as well as any device- specific size limitations (which either come with the documentation

 the same computer (and is it the same partition and/or drive) or between difgferent computers or devices?&nbsp; What version of Vista are you using (e.g., 32-bit Vista Business SP2)?&nbsp; How much RAM do you have and have you checked to make sure it is all working.&nbsp;
 Has this been an ongoing problem or did it just start?&nbsp; Did you add any new software or hardware of any kind (including updates) since&nbsp; just before the problem began or if it has beeen there from the start then in the last few weeks?&nbsp; What folders are you
 copying the files from and what folders (if any) are you copying them to?&nbsp; Do you receive any error mesages (if so, what do they say EXACTLY including any codes) or does it simply not work?&nbsp; What is the manufacturer, make, model, and serial number or Product

<p><strong>I desperately need your help to help you</strong>.&nbsp; I know I've asked a lot of questions but I need this information to try to find the cause of the problem and come up with a recommendation.&nbsp; If I were sitting in front of the computer it would take
 me only a few minutes to find out this infomation but I don't have that luxury.&nbsp; I may in fact have already provided the answer to the problem with the format limitation sizes - but I don't know - and if that's the problem there may be a way to fix the problem
 without losing any data in the process (formatting isn't the only option to choice the format of a partition - you can also use the convert command).</p>
<p>I await your reply with the above information and then we can move on from there.&nbsp; It may take me a while to research the system and situation depending on what information you provide - but I'll do so as quickly as i can and get back to you.</p>
<p>TI look forward to working with you to lresolve this problem (if it isn't already resolved).</p>

                    I've had an Intel Pentium G4560 for a couple years now and I would like to replace it. I generally use it to run games like Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield. My GPU is a NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1050 Ti.

            Hi Porpoise, I'm Bill.
<br />
<br />Your CPU uses the LGA1151 socket, so depending on your motherboard compatibility, you'd be able to upgrade to a Core i5 or i7 of the same socket. A couple of examples would be the i5 6600 or the i7 6700. Either of those would be a good upgrade for you.
<br />
<br />If you want to upgrade any higher than those, you'd need to purchase a newer motherboard and RAM setup. But for now, those two options are good if you're looking to upgrade just your CPU.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need further information!

<br />Are you using a PC or a laptop, it depends, sometimes the processor is soldered onto the motherboard?
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your system - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing of your system . . .

<h2>            Windows 8.1 not responding</h2>
                    Every time I boot up my pc running windows 8.1, none of my apps show up for about a minute or two. Then, every time I try to click on something, nothing happens. I get error messages popping up saying 'the remote procedure call failed.' I don't have a
 clue what that means as I'm not really a computer guy. So basically, my pc has become completely unresponsive, even in safe mode. When booted up in safe mode, I get error messages saying something about the 'exe.exlporer failing to launch' or something like
 that. I don't know how to fix it. I think I know which program is causing the issue but I cant get into the control panel to uninstall it. What do I do?&nbsp;

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

<p>If you purchased this console new and it is still within three years of the original purchase date, you can either call customer support to begin filing a repair order, or you can process a repair order online. Both the 3-Red Light and E74 issues are still

<p>First you need to register your console with Microsoft on the Xbox website. Go to support.xbox.com you can register it there. If it is under warranty, it will be repaired at no cost. If not under warranty, and it has not been modded in any way, Microsoft
 will repair it for a fee, check the website for call support for details.</p>

<p>After trying everything the first time, I just reinstalled the whole computer (Win 10 and all software).</p>

<p>- connection to the Internet is there, but not accessible with ANY software except Tor Browser from which I am sending this post now.</p>
<p>I run some diagnostic through my firewall software and also couldn't fix it.</p>

<p>Dear Kem Mon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to do a custom installation of windows as you proposed but couldn't due to the lack of internet connection...</p>
<p>So, in the end I did a PC Reset through the Recovery option in Update &amp; Security part of Settings.</p>
<p>Everything works just fine and hope this time the same glitch wouldn't happen again.</p>
<p>If it does happen, I will definitely come here again and ask if you have come to the conclusion what happened to my system and how to overcome the problem.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your effort and support.</p>

<br />You will need to backup all your files onto another drive, then download and create a bootable Linux Installation onto a flash drive and install that , while wiping your drive at the same time . ..

<p>
</p><p><span>Does the same apply to SFB client? ie in China do users use a modified version which is not secure?</span><span>ie if they download the web
 client is it a modified version which is not secure to be compliant with legislation?</span></p>

            Hi Alistair,<br />
<br />
Here is the answer to your question:<br />
<br />
Ans1. The Skype Meetings App are the same <em>(No "doctored" version).</em><br />
<br />
Ans2. However, 21Vianet operates local Office 365 datacenters to provide the ability to use Office 365 services while keeping data within China. &nbsp;For your reference:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt651782.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396#Skype for Business Online features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 operated by 21Vianet</a><br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes. 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem

            Hi Ravi, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Try updating your printer drivers, or uninstalling your printers one by one, restarting the spooler, and then trying to standby/hibernate. &nbsp;If it works, the last printer you uninstalled may have drivers that don't work well when going into standby/hibernate.

<h2>            Folder is hidden by default in a USB drive</h2>
                    Hi, I don't have any experience to the problem I am currently having here. I recently inserted a USB drive that contains pictures and for some reason the folder is hidden and I wasn't able to view the folder until I changed the options to view hidden folders.
 What I would like to know is WHY this is the case meaning how did the folder became hidden in the first place? Is this a risk in my PC?&nbsp; Is there a way to make this folder normal?<br />

            <p>Hi Tsubasa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, to know that you are facing this issue. I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Did you used your pen drive on any other computer to transfer the files?</li><li>Is the name of the hidden folder different from previous picture folder? </li><li>Which antivirus program are you using?</li><li>Do you get any error message?</li></ol>
<p>From the issue description it seems that the pen drive might be infected with virus or you might have copied the hidden folder which is visible from another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pen drive is an external data storage device and commonly used to move or copy files among the computers, so connecting to different computers make them more vulnerable to get infected by viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The virus can change the attributes of your pen drive files and make the data inaccessible to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run the Microsoft Safety Scanner and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disclaimer:</span></strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</p>

                    I have bought Asus G53Sx-A1 Laptop, it came with Windows 7 Home Premium 64Bit OEM installed.. i wish to do a clean install or restore the system to the original state due to virus risk, but i am unable to create recovery disc in the initial time. i am
 just thinking to install a fresh windows 7 home premium 64 bit RTM version and activate the os by entering the product key given at the back of my laptop. i would like to know whether RTM version can be activated with the OEM Key for the same OS version. I
 have this only option as i am unable to get the recovery disc from the manufacturer at this point. kindly advice..

Also, you should have a restore partition that will automatically reinstall Windows 7.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Reinstall Windows Preinstalled On Computer</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>You can contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.
</span><span>Contact information for the manufacturer of your computer can be found here:

            <p>Yes, you can use a OEM Windows 7 Home Premium product key with either a Windows 7 Home Premium RTM or SP1 installation disc. In fact, you can download a Windows 7 Home Premium with SP1 .ISO image, burn to a blank DVD disc and do the install. This will save
 you a lot of trouble to install SP1 separately:</p>

            Print preview is available in nearly any program you are trying to print from, including IE. Its nothing to do with win7 but is specific to the program you are using

            No the answer is not helpful at all.&nbsp; It is with the new Windows 7 that I am unable to find the place to set it so that it always shows the preprint automatically before printing.&nbsp; I need the steps to get to the area that I can set that.&nbsp; Thank you for
 your reply anyway.&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The freezing issue you're experiencing when launching <strong>Visual Studio Community 2017</strong> might be due to a corrupted installation file. This kind of issue is more complex than what is handled in the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Answers</strong> forums. It would be better to post your concern on
<strong>MSDN Visual Studio</strong> forums. You can expect better assistance from the audience of the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Developer</strong> <strong>Network</strong> (<strong>MSDN</strong>) forums regarding this issue. You can access the forum from this

Windows Search does not display any results, even though the folder is included in the indexed locations.<br />

            Hi Naman,<br />
<br />
I am already running Windows Search 4.0, and my version of XP SP3 is up to date with all patches and updates.<br />
<br />
The first support page you link to indicates that I should not be experiencing this issue for standard file types which are registered with XP (e.g. Microsoft Office files such as Excel, and PDF files):<br />
<br />
</span>
<ul>
<li>Mimefilt.dll: Filters Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) files</li><li>Nlhtml.dll: Filters HTML 3.0 or earlier files</li><li>Offfilt.dll: Filters Microsoft Office files (Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint)</li><li>Query.dll: Filters plain text files (default filter) and binary files (null filter)"</li></ul>
<br />
Also,&nbsp; Resolution Method 1 doesn't list either .xls or .pdf in the list of file types for which it may resolve the issue.&nbsp; Method 2 applies to the standard search indexing service (Search Companion), and does not address the Windows Search service.<br />
<br />
Please also note that the Search Companion service currently displays the PDF results, so presumably the correct filter component for PDF files is already in place.&nbsp; For some reason, Search Companion can find the text, however Windows Search cannot.&nbsp; And neither
 is able to find the text within Excel files, which should have the proper filter components already built in to XP.<br />
<br />
I have already done a fair amount of searching online for potential explanations of this behavior, so unfortunately boilerplate links to MS support pages will probably not help.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>so the trailer for the new game is out and well, it just looks like very little went into improving the game graphics (they claim new engine)&nbsp;and it is very cut and paste looking in the visual department.

 why folks aren't seeing many graphical changes. This doesn't bode well. The old engine has proven problematic at every step.<br />

<p>Dated graphics!?!?!? Totally disagree. Go play Homefront then come back and talk about just how dated you think CoD graphics are. CoD graphics may not seem upgraded, but they don't really need to be. The CoD graphics have always been one of the better ones
 out there. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The report will be sent to the PET for them to investigate.</p>
<p>After that, you can Avoid and Block them to prevent them from playing with or contacting you in the future.</p>

            <p>I strongly suggest that you reach out to your ISP (Internet Service Provider), to have them know about your situation and to issue you a new unique public IP address (WAN address).</p>
<p>As long as they know your public IP address (being the same address assigned by your ISP), they can still carry out DoS, or DDoS attacks and overwhelm your gateway with bitstream of data, to prevent legitamate traffic to pass through, regardless if you're connected to the Xbox Live services, or not.</p>

                    <p><span><span>I am unable to update any Microsoft software on my PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The update process never completes the "Checking for updates" process.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>The PC is an HP XW6200 Workstation which originally used Windows XP.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It was purchased second hand after being professionally refurbished and upgraded (Graphics card, Ram, Hard disc, Windows 7).</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>Currently running Windows 7 Professional SP1 64-Bit and as far as I know Windows 7 was clean installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This PC is not compatible with Windows 10.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Over the last three days several attempts have been made to install update, all achieved nothing.</span></p>

<p><span>Windows Update has been running for approximately 10 hours and for the whole of that time has been showing "Checking for updates...".</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>A post on the update forum suggested setting "Never check for updates", restarting and then reinstating "Install updates automatically".<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>This software among other options has a vulnerability scanner.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This reported yesterday that there were 15 updates to Windows and other programs that had not been implemented.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I allowed the software to initiate updating in the hope it would clear the problem.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It did not, I left it running for about 6 hours, supposedly downloading a "Skype" update (sorry I can't remember and can't find more details of this update now ).</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I eventually aborted the attempt.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and trouble.&nbsp; While preparing my last reply I saw something and followed up on it once I'd replied and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set Windows Update to "Never install update"</p>
<p>I downloaded and installed KB3172605</p>
<p>This forced a restart</p>
<p>Checking for updates then found 17 updates which have successfully installed.</p>
<p>I've now reinstated automatic updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again Thank you for your help</p>

<p>
</p><p>The following is from memory, so I hope I haven't left anything out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, go to Network Connections, right-click on the icon for your wireless adapter, and select Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the "Wireless Networks" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your network name (SSID) is listed under "Preferred networks," select it and click the "Properties" button.&nbsp; Configure password and encryption information here.&nbsp; The "Connection" tab is where you should find the box to connect automatically.</p>

            <p>I have seen this link yes but it is in vista and that option is not there in XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can't set the password in the properties. When you connect, a bubble pops that asks for credentials. The screenshot shows that credentials screen.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If so, what happens if you attempt to set the password here?&nbsp; In this screenshot, the boxes for password are dimmed because "Data encryption" is set to "Disabled."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you mentioned that this machine is in "the shop."&nbsp; Do you have a separate authentication server for your network or do you just have a home-style workgroup with WPA or WPA2 encryption?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select the "Authentication" tab, is the box to Enable IEEE 802.1x authentication checked or not checked?</p>

            <p>Yes we have EAP authentication.</p>
<p>In later Windows versions we can enter the password but doesn't seem to exist in XP</p>

            <p>Sorry, I don't have much experience with EAP/PEAP authentication.&nbsp; See if the directions on either of these sites help any --&gt;

</p><p>In either case, the methods shown will probably only work if you have configured a password for the user to log on to the computer in the first place.</p>

            <p>The controller is from an outside vendor and it is not on our domain. It is connecting with the "use the current user" unchecked, so it asks for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping me tho... :)</p>
