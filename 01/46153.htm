    <title>Surface Pro 2017 battery down to 8Wh &#8211; normal or factory - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 battery down to 8Wh &#8211; normal or factory defect&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Just to start, I’ve had a few Surfaces Pro and always thought the devices were almost perfect for business, especially when travelling a lot, especially with i7. But somehow, all of them had flaws (and I don’t mean design flaws like the weird
 SP3 thermal throttling), I mean... defects. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My first one was a pre-order i7 SP3 back in 2014 (?) and I loved it until its wifi/bluetooth module died in a few months. Had it replaced under warranty with another, that one lasted much longer and its wifi/bluetooth died only 2 years ago.
 I got an i7 SP 2017 for work in December 2017, and continued using the SP3 at home with an external USB wifi module, until I went to the US (yes, I’m a loyal fan from where they don’t sell them officially) and replaced the SP3 (naturally, it was out of warranty,
 so I had to pay) with an SP4 with screen defects that I only found when I had no time to go back to the store. Thankfully, MS agreed to mark it as eligible for a free exchange (but then failed to communicate the exact exchange procedure, but that’s a different
 story), so I’m hoping I’ll get it replaced one day. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now back to the SP 2017. I was quite happy with all aspects of it, including the battery life (especially after the SP3) but running battery reports out of curiosity after a few months was showing the capacity was a bit lower than designed.
 The device was working well, I mostly used it in the office with a genuine doc station, so I didn’t pay much attention. Until this spring when I had it switch off a few times a lot earlier than I expected (around 30%). And most of the times it wouldn’t start
 even with the dock plugged in, only a separate charger could help it start. Naturally, things got worse, Windows started saying “plugged in, not charging” at various levels (sometimes at 40-45%), the device would shut off at 40%, then at 50+%. One of the battery
 reports I ran last week showed 28,540 mWh. </span><span>I did try uninstalling the battery drivers. Didn’t help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here’s what I tried today:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>After the device had been hibernated and plugged into the dock for a full weekend, I unplugged the doc and run the battery report at 10:51 am. Got a surprisingly good number: 35,240 mWh. The battery level was 100%.</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/29c1e43e-53ab-481a-aece-b33a194cf049?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/29c1e43e-53ab-481a-aece-b33a194cf049?upload=true" /></a></li><li><span>Let it run at the “max performance” power mode (but very light load like Edge and Outlook, no videos or gaming).</span></li><li><span>The screen went black in under 20 minutes (but the keyboard was lit, so I realized it was hibernating, not just switched off – a rare gift these days).</span></li><li><span>It wouldn’t start without charging, so I tried the dock and surprisingly it did start. The first thing I did was a battery report (at 11:09 am) that showed 8,000 mWh. And the
<p>
</p><p><span>A few questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Is the battery dead? Today was the first time it shut down that soon, usually it does live for at least an hour. And I’ve never seen a 8Wh capacity before, the lowest was 19 or something.</span></li><li><span>The device is out of warranty (of course). Is there any chance MS will admit it’s a factory defect? Since I’m not in the US, it’s much easier to pay for an aftermarket replacement here than to wait for a trip to the US or Europe (and then
 they’ll say it’ll take them a week at the very least). </span></li><li><span>This one’s not serious: just to make fun of myself, should I get an SP6?&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your opinion, Barb!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not just a sudden drop to 8Wh. After charging and rebooting, the battery report is now showing&nbsp;32,760 mWh but it won't last for more than an hour. And yes, I did try the calibration method.</p>

            <p>It sure looks to me like your battery is failing. You can certainly try a wipe<br />and reimage from a downloadable recovery image which would rule out software<br />issues. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; -- If this<br />bad behavior continues after a wipe and reimage and before you install any apps,<br />then you'd know for sure..</p>

    <title>Screen Clipping and Cropping on Windows 8 Metro Interface and One Note - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tony r5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Clipping and Cropping  on Windows 8 Metro Interface and One Note</h2>
                    <p>I recently acquired an Asus T100 Tablet/Netbook Hybrid and had a few issues I was hoping for help with. These questions refer specifically to the metro/touch functionality of Windows 8.1, not the desktop view.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is there any cropping, snipping, partial screen capture tool that works in the metro mode of Windows 8.1?</strong></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>I have found a few desktop options to use:&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;snipping tool</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;Onetastic add on for onenote 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;Onenote's CTRL + N Screen capture</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;Opening Snipping Tool in desktop mode then CTRL + PRT SC in metro.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But was hoping for a more intuitive feature that works without using the desktop functionality and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is more tablet/touch friendly. Something akin to the snipping onenote tool, but for the metro &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; layout( I mean do i really have
 to juggle the the desktop, crop and save snippets to files when all i &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; want is to have them copied to the clipboard?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. <strong>&nbsp;Does the Onenote metro app not support picture cropping or ink note search?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A continuation of the issue above, I notice I can add window cropping capabilities to the desktop Onenote 2013 program with the Onetastic add on, but not to its free metro app counterpart.</li><li>I have had to use a third program to crop pictures manually, one at a time thusfar, and it gets too cumbersome for notes since i have to toggle back and forth between split screen pdf reader/onenote metro apps and desktop.</li><li>Additionally I can't seem to find a feature to search hand written notes that desktop outlook has.Is this available?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Im essentially trying to make my tablet as note-friendly and intuitive as possible, any further tips are appreciated.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the prompt response Shawn. I had noticed this. However, is that my best/only option?</p>
<p>My problem is that every time i cut something I have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Snipping tool, which forces me to the desktop.</li><li>Go back to metro app I want to snip.</li><li>A successful snip (CTRL + PRT SC) forces me to the desktop again to verify the snip and ask if i want to write on it or edit it.</li><li>I have to go back to the metro app in which I want to paste it.</li><li>A successful snip closes the tool and I have to manually open it again if I want to repeat the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>What i was trying to do, for example, is have the pdf reader on one side of the screen, and my onenote app on the other, and simply cut and paste pictures from it or Internet Explorer 11 onto my notes without having to juggle the desktop and snipping tool
 as well.</p>

            <p>I don't think it's the only option, and probably not the best.&nbsp; But I think it probably comes down to the screen clipper app's behavior.&nbsp; Ideally it sounds like what you need is a screenclipper that does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Immediately begins a new snip when launched, without taking you to the desktop to show any other UI.&nbsp; Ironically the Windows Screen Snip tool used to immediately begin a new snip in Windows 7, but doesn't anymore.&nbsp; I tried copying the exe file (which is
 a different version and size) over to my Windows 8 machine, but it wouldn't launch at all.<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
</li><li>Copies your selection to the clipboard immediately, also without taking you to the desktop to show any UI.</li></ol>
<p>I see no reason both of these couldn't be fulfilled, but I'm not familiar with any apps that behave this way.&nbsp; I am only tangentially aware of a few other screenclippers.&nbsp; I have a license for TechSmith's
<a href="http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SnagIt</a> program, but I've never used it.&nbsp; Typically for my blog or this site I go through the (admittedly terrible) 5-step process you outlined above.</p>

            <p>Have you tried using "Scan To OneNote," this little app that comes with the desktop Onenote 2013?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following steps work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open&nbsp;"Scan to OneNote"&nbsp;on your desktop (also opens automatically when I open OneNote2013)</p>
<p>2) Go to your metro app</p>
<p>3) Hit Shift, Windows and S all at once</p>
<p>This should trigger the "Scan to OneNote" app to function like snipping tool</p>
<p>4) Snip as you wish</p>
<p>* It helps if you set your "Scan to OneNote" Screen Clippings to "To Clip board only," (Access it by opening OneNote2013, go to file-&gt; Options, Under&nbsp;Send to OneNote tab)&nbsp;otherwise it would have a desktop popup that would ask you where you want to send it
 to- which is annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can now paste it anywhere you like,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>

I have install two further 2GB sticks of memory (8GB in total) the bios recognises the new memory but windows doesn't boot. It gets to the loading windows stage but the "swirling" windows icon doesn't apear.<br />
<br />
Each piece of memory has been tested and does work so I know it's not faulty memory. The memory is all exactly the same it just seems to be an issue if I add more than 4 GB.<br />
<br />
My machine is a Dell Dimension 5150 and has the latest Bios version. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.
                </div>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Please check voltage settings on Ram (.ie 1.8v or 2.1v ) make sure all&nbsp;are the same voltage.<br />
<br />
Also&nbsp;check in bios&nbsp;and set system voltage&nbsp;control to Auto.<br />
<br />
If all the Ram is the same voltage try adding the other 4GB instead of the installed 4GB. to rule out bad ram.<br />
<br />
Also try with 6GB.<br />
<br />
Slan go foill, Paul<br />

            Hi Friend,
<div><br />
<div>No need to search further. A Dell dimension 5150 with 945/950 chipset can only address a maximum of 4gb of ram period. This is due to limitation imposed by the Intel chipset. This is true even if you installed 64 bit os visat or 7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So dont waste your time looking for any other answers.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>It would be better if you can assist me with a certain information regarding the query:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Are you referring to charging of a laptop’s battery when the selective suspended mode is disabled for USB devices?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I would like to inform you that the USB selective suspend feature allows the hub driver to suspend an individual port without affecting the operation of the other ports on the hub. Selective suspension of USB devices is
 especially useful in portable computers, since it helps conserve battery power. This mode for the USB devices also helps in reducing the overall power consumption. Disabling this setting will cause additional battery power consumption when your computer is
 in Sleep or Hibernation mode and unplugged. Again, if the devices are connected and the laptop is running on a battery, it would take a few more moments to completely charged up as compared the time period which it would normally take if the laptop is in off
 state or there are no external USB devices connected to it.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Hope it answer the query.</font></font></font></p>

<h2>            Romance Scam</h2>
                    <p>I talk almost nigthly with skype user "live:********" a man I met online.&nbsp; &nbsp; My&nbsp; skype id is live:********&nbsp; I am aware that it is ok to be signed into more than 1 device and i am sometimes signed in on my apple iphone and my laptop.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not concerned
 that he may be signed in on more than one device but that he may not be the user of the second or third device.&nbsp; It has come to my attention over the past 3 months of daily phone calls, video calls, and text messages that at times it seems almost like my boyfriend
 is somewhat different in appearance, voice , or at the least the person I text may not know all what was said fully on the last skype call.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;A&nbsp; couple of weeks ago in a fight we broke up on a rare phone call and then later it seemed when he texted me he did not know we were broken up, until i reminded him and then he he said.&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; and stopped texting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition sometimes the "last seen online"&nbsp; indicator will be hours or days off"&nbsp; I have a strong fear that i am being manipulated, by two brothers or a girlfriend and the man i know as "live:&lt;Removed&gt;".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I do not want to know where he is or any identifying information</strong></em>, but would it e possible<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>for you to check if i am being spoken from one city and texted from another within a few
 minutes or hours.&nbsp; </strong></em></span>&nbsp; It would help me to know to end the relationship or contact law enforcement, as i have given this person lots of personal information and now worry about what his or their intentions are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            High Cpu and Disk usage at idle and beyond.</h2>
                    Hi everyone, not the best with this type of thing so hoping someone will help me out.&nbsp; My PC has off and on ran a choppy fps right from the go.&nbsp; I've had the computer for about a year and never really cared but now I would really like to get to the bottom
 of it.&nbsp; My search has led me to notice that if i check my task manager while idle, my cpu usage is often 30-40% and my disk usage shoots up to 100% every so often.&nbsp; I've seen that 100% disk every now again is not necessarily awful so I've focused my attention
 on the cpu usage.&nbsp; I can post a screenshot of when its idle so you can check it out but the processes that seem to be doing the most damage are; Antimalware Service Executable, Service host: Superfetch, Cortana, and Radeon Settings: Host Application.&nbsp; Any
 help at all would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

<br />Click Start, scroll down to Cortana
<br />Right click Cortana 
<br />Click More
<br />Click App settings

            DOS version 5.2.3790?&nbsp; That sounds like the version number for Windows Server 2003, not a version of DOS.&nbsp; I'm not a computer historian, but as far as I can determine, there was no version 5.2 of DOS.<br />
<br />
Are you using Windows of some sort?&nbsp; If so, what?<br />
<br />
Try using the following in a Command Prompt window (assuming you are using Windows) or at your DOS prompt<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren /?<br />
<br />
REN is a short name for the RENAME command, so you can also see if that works on whatever system you're using.<br />
<br />
The command I gave you works in a Windows 7 Command Prompt window. <br />
<br />
I haven't used any of the following, but if you can't get that command to work on your system, see this --&gt;

<h2>            windows 10 preparing automatic repair black screen &#40;Stuck&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
Hello,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I Have Dell G3 laptop&nbsp;<span>"Preparing Automatic Repair" - black screen.&nbsp;</span>I don't see the Windows loading. I just have a black screen with logo DELL in the centre. Nothing is moving, nothing else appears, until the "Preparing Automatic Repair"
 appears at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I've tried doing the hard restarts many times, but the laptop will never&nbsp;<span>boot into the Recovery Environment.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I tried hard restarts but it keeps repeating this cycle over and over again - "Preparing Automatic Repair" - black screen "STUCK" . I even left my laptop on the black screen for a couple of hours, hoping it might fix itself but it does nothing.</span></p>

<p>Hi Bachtiar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the following methods and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong><strong>Refresh the screen.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use this keyboard shortcut first for the easiest and quickest potential resolution "<em>control+shift+win+B</em>". This will refresh the screen and will collect some telemetry for investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot black screen or blank screen errors.</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14106/windows-10-troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking Yes or No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            call of duty ghosts</h2>
                    
<p>microsoft</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I wish it were much easier to post a comment and give consumer feedback.&nbsp; I don't even know if I am in the right area.&nbsp; trying to reach Microsoft Xbox Management.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; call of duty ghosts was offered at the Microsoft store for $4.99 yet the game was sold out.&nbsp; it lists for $59.99 on gold on xbox live.&nbsp; very confusing to the consumer why the price is not the same.&nbsp; disappointed I was not able to get a code to download
 the game for $4.99 since the disks were sold out.&nbsp; I called that day the offer was active</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; on another note I purchased cod advance warfare and seen on gamespot that Microsoft is offering $15 back on a purchase of $100.&nbsp; unsure if I will get the credit posted to my rewards account.&nbsp; ps4 does a much better job of offering discounts on games
 listed on ps4 store and crediting back to your account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I like my xbox but I find it to be more difficult to do business.&nbsp; Huge xbox one fan
</p>
<p>just wanted to give my feedback</p>

<p>You should specify that you're using the PC version of <em>Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection</em>.&nbsp; There is no cross-platform play between it and the Xbox 360 version, I'm afraid.</p>

<br />Thank you for reaching out to us.

<br />A call would includes audio, and a chat is just text :).

<br />What do you mean by "my calls and chats are the same"?

<br />I wish you a great day/night :)!

    <title>Skype not picking up camera Logitech HDPro C920 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drdeb&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype not picking up camera Logitech HDPro C920</h2>
                    <p>I tried to use Skype on my desktop today for the first time. I'm on Windows 10. I updated the Skype app, so I have the most recent version. I have a&nbsp;Logitech HDPro Webcam C920, and I know it works bc I use it all the time with Zoom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype recognizes it for audio (it picks up the built-in microphone) so I can be heard, but it doesn't recognize it for video. On the "test" screen, there's just black. I've checked my video camera settings, and that's not the problem (permission is granted).
 What should I do next?</p>

            Hi drdeb(2),
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />If you are using the Skype for Windows 10 App, please try the Desktop Version here:-
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />Select the drop-down arrow and 'Get Skype for Windows' instead of 'Get Skype for Windows 10'.       
        </p>

            Apparently that's the version I have installed. (Skype for Windows 10, and when I click it, it takes me to the MSFT store which says I have that app installed).

            I did that. There isn't a choice that says "desktop version." There's Skype for Windows 10 (which I have) and Skype for Windows. Am I supposed to be choosing the latte? (and if so, why?)

<p>Since a crash is logged, I suggest you update your video drivers to a newer release:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/DS501927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel Gfx Driver for Windows 10 (64-bit) - Desktops and Workstation [lenovo.com]</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>An issue with the video drivers can cause a camera not to initialize properly in some applications.</span></p>
<p>If you continue experiencing detection/compatibility issues with the camera, using the drivers that come with the OS, you have the option of installing and using the latest Logitech drivers. Some builds of Windows 10 work better with one driver over the
 other. I personally can toggle between either in the latest build of Windows 10 using my c920 and it appears to function fine in my everyday use.</p>

            You should choose the latter because it is the desktop version. As you are currently using the App version, they are two seperate versions of Skype, and what may not work on one, may very likely work on the other.

<h2>            Skype says my video is disabled.</h2>
                    I run a MS tablet surface pro with 5i 7th generation chip. I can see the skype caller but they can't see me. The icon says that the video is disabled. How can I correct this?

<br />Open the Settings App

<br />Go to Privacy - Camera
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your Camera' is turned on and make sure that Skype is also set to On

<p>I have updated to the newest cumulative update as requested above and File Explorer is still crashing with the same error in the Application Log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a note I have also rebuilt the index (again) cleared the File Explorer History, Reinstalled my graphics card driver checked to see if I have IDT Audio removed one third party application from the Context Menu, reset the winsock in an elevated command
 prompt (netsh winsock reset) and have ran sfc /scannow a few times just for giggles since a lot of forums have recommended that :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>File Explorer keeps crashing.&nbsp; I'm thinking of installing the 1803 Spring insider update but i'm afraid that won't fix the issue.&nbsp; Remember I am also searching on the network, is there a way to index network drives?&nbsp; I'm also trying to figure out if there
 may be an issue with a nested folder that may exceed the 255 character limit but our storage devices are Isilon, I'll see if our network team can reach out to verify any files that may exceed 255.</p>

            You could perform a repair upgrade to see if that works.

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think a repair upgrade would do much good since this is happening on a clean install.&nbsp; The media was from the VLK library and I have also tried the ISO from the microsoft website that takes over an hour to download.&nbsp; I've used clean installs of 1607,
 1703 and 1709.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier I am tempted to try to install the 1803 Insider build to see if I get the same result...&nbsp; I'm still thinking this could be caused by a 256 character limit...</p>
