<p>You can download and utilize <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong><u>Do some house cleaning and dust off that hard drive:</u></strong></p>
<p>You may wish to free up some disk space (will also aid in getting rid of things you do not utilize) by going through these steps:</p>
<p>Windows XP should take between 4.5 and 9GB *with* an Office suite, Photo Editing software, alternative Internet browser(s), various Internet plugins and a host of other things installed.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the stability of your system, you can delete the uninstall files for the patches that Windows XP has installed...<br />

<p>You can run Disk Cleanup - built into Windows XP - to erase all but your latest restore point and cleanup even more "loose files"..</p>

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />

<p><strong><u>Cleanup the Update Components on your Windows XP machine</u></strong></p>
<p>While likely not 100% necessary - it is probably a good idea at this time to make sure you continue getting the updates you need. This will help you make sure your update system is ready to do this for you.</p>

.... and save it to the<strong> root of your C:\ drive</strong>. After saving it to the<em>root of the C:\ drive</em>, do the following:</p>
<p>Close all Internet Explorer windows and other applications.</p>
<p>Start button --&gt; RUN and type in:<br />

<p>(If asked, select "Run".) --&gt; Click on NEXT --&gt; Select "I agree" and click on NEXT --&gt; When it finishes installing, click on "Finish"...</p>

<p>Now reset your Windows Update Components with this FixIt (you will <strong><em>*NOT*</em></strong> use the aggressive version):<br />

<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Now that your system is generally free of malware (assuming you have an AntiVirus application), you have cleaned up the 'extra applications' that might be running and taking up your valuable memory and processor, you have cleared out some valuable drive
 space and made sure there are no issues with the drive itself and your Windows Update components are updated and should be working in top shape - there is only one other thing you<em>may</em> wish to do:</p>
<p>Obtain and install the latest hardware device drivers for your system from the system/hardware manufacturers' support and/or download web site.</p>
<p>If you wish, come back and let us know a little more information about your system - in particular the Make/Model of the system you have - and perhaps someone here can point you to the right place(s) to go to accomplish this. This is not 100% necessary -
 but I would bet that you would gain some performance and features by doing this part.</p>

<div>&nbsp;I'm currently trying to follow the steps about re-installing it, however when I get to the part of where to go turn off the windows features, the box is totally empty, nothing listed....</div>

            What maintenance did you do?&nbsp; I would start by undoing any changes that made by using System Restore.&nbsp; This won't touch any of your personal files, pictures, or documents: it only restores system files back to backup versions.&nbsp; The restore process can&nbsp;only
 takes about 3 minutes to do, and it's by far the safest first step.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Start System Restore<br />
Press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwinLogo.jpg" />-R to open the Run box, and run the program
<strong>rstrui.exe<br />
</strong>(that's short for <em>restore user interface</em>).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Choose your Restore Point<br />
You'll be guided through a few questions. You'll pick the date/time you know your system was last working correctly, then the system will restore the files from that date and reboot.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lost Files in Media Player</h2>
                    Can't find any of my prior playlists from Media Player - looks like they are in my files somewhere hidden since they show up for a second and "poof" they were gone.&nbsp; This must be a result of Windows 10 updates.&nbsp; I have looked for help in forums but nothing
 helped me locate the lost files.&nbsp; I am not a "geek" so I don't want to go where I might mess up my system - is there any way I can find my files?

 continue to update the Windows 10 Groove Music apps for PC, Xbox, and Windows Phone so you can play your purchased music, including the tracks you’ve uploaded to OneDrive.</strong> On December 31, 2017, the option to stream, purchase, and download music from
 Groove Music was discontinued. If your purchased music was downloaded, you’ll still be able to listen to it.

<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Groove App on IOS and Android, then yes this has been discontinued. However, the quote from the help article states that the Groove Music App on Windows 10, Xbox One and Windows Phone&nbsp;<strong>will still be supported at this moment in
 time</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that the content should still work providing you download it onto your device and then use the Groove Music App to play the content. The Groove Music app is now a Music Player rather then a streaming service it once was. For streaming service,
 please use Spotify or another service provider of your choice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unsure, please feel free to ask and we will always try our best to help and dig for information that is public and can be publicly shared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When, and if, Groove Music App is discontinued, there will be some sort of announcement made :)</p>

<h2>            Duplicate folder in the same directory-- and it won&#39;t stay deleted</h2>
                    
<p>In one of my directories, I have duplicate folders:</p>
<p>C:\Users\Public&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; There are TWO "Public Music" folders.</p>
<p>One has music + desktop.ini&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other has nothing but a desktop.ini</p>
<p>I'm serious. Two folders in the same directory with the exact same name. And different content in each. And it's not the library I'm talking about.</p>
<p>I believe I created the duplicate when I changed the name of my Music folder to "Public Music". I do not believe there was another Public Music folder in there. I believe I was also sharing the file. (Even though I think this might not have happened if I
 "unshared" the folder before I changed anything. Problem is, I STILL haven't figured out how to do that, despite going online and trying numerous suggestions in various forums and such.</p>
<p>However, my biggest problem is that I cannot delete either of the duplicate folders. It's aggravating having two totally different Public Music folders in the same directory. Well, technically I CAN delete them. They just come right back when I restart Windows.
 (Or maybe Windows Explorer. I'm not sure.) I've successfully moved the folders to my desktop before, and then deleted them. When I restart the comp, they come right back. So moving them didn't fix anything either.</p>
<p>I KNOW that there are other people with this problem, so I want people to please take note of this. Any suggestions at all (literally) would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<div>Explorer shows display names so the folder appears with the correct name for</div>

<p>I never got to change the permissions. Access is denied. I right-click, go to Properties, and go to the Security Tab. In Security, it says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continue, you must be an administrative user with permission<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I click Continue, and it says that I "do not have permission to view this object's security properties".</p>
<p>If instead, I had clicked on Advanced, I would have seen four tabs: Permissions, Auditing, Owner, and Effective Permissions. On ALL of these, I have attempted to change the owner to myself, the admin of the comp. I get this message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unable to set new owner on Music.</p>
<p>Access is denied.</p>

<p>I tried a popular registry hack called "Take Ownership" that allows me to right click a file or folder and select Take Ownership from the context menu to take ownership of the file or folder. No joy. Somebody, please help me.</p>

<p>I fixed it. After I tried everything you said, then used the rd command in cmd prompt, I restarted the comp this morning to find that the unwanted folder, now named "Music" rather than its fake name, "Public Music", gave me a chance to edit permissions.
 I left it alone for several hours, and I lost the ability to change the permissions again, getting the same error I used to get. However, I restarted my computer and once again got the chance to edit permissions. I deleted the folder and restarted, and it
 finally stayed deleted. I might have been able to fix the problem yesterday by following David's instructions, but I think I didn't reboot out of fear that I would lose my hard work again. Rebooting MIGHT have fixed it this time.</p>
<p>Talk about strange. Does anybody know why the folder was acting like that, not allowing me to change permissions, and not staying deleted?</p>

            Actually, I didn't fix it. It came back again at a restart. The only way I am half-satisfied with my solution was by replacing the deletable "Users &gt;&gt; Default &gt;&gt; Music" folder with the undeletable one, since I can move the folder around. Therefore, I don't
 have a loose undeletable folder anywhere.

 up the unit to 100% during the day, after leaving it overnight turned off it is down below 15% in the morning. What is going on?

<h2>            Desktop Bug - Moving icons moves other icons</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think may have been caused by the Anniversary update (which caused A LOT of bugs and problems), but moving icons on my desktop shuffles everything around. Mostly to do with the most bottom row on my desktop. Moving anything there will pop icons all around
 without even moving anything close to them. No idea what causes this.</p>

<p>Hi Neora,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving desktop icons may arise due to a recent update. Incompatible or outdated display drivers can also trigger this kind of behavior. For us to properly isolate the case, supply more information by answering these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How and when did the issue start?</li><li>Did it immediately occur after you installed the Anniversary update?</li><li>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes to your device prior to this happening?</li><li>What steps have you taken so far to resolve the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your reply so we can arrive with the appropriate resolution for your query.</p>

<p>1)I think it did start after the anniversary update. It hadn't occurred before. I noticed it when trying to move icons to the most bottom right side of the my screen. They glitched and messed up my whole desktop icon positioning.</p>
<p>2) I'm not sure, but maybe I just didn't notice it right away.</p>
<p>3) I only own a laptop, so no hardware changes and nothing really serious software wise.</p>
<p>4) I tried changing desktop icon sizes, seeing if it helped anything, but it didn't. Don't remember if I tried anything else, but I also noticed that moving files on my desktop is really laggy.</p>

            I did update my Intel HD drivers, but I don't know if they caused it. I did update them after anniversary update. As the update caused major issues with many games (have to use vsync on almost all my games now, otherwise they're unplayable).

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might be facing the above issue due to the compatibility of the hardware or due to the non-updated USB ports on your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> I suggest you to update the USB port drivers from
<strong>Device manager</strong> manually by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Device manager</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus Controller</strong> option and check if the device is detected without showing any yellow exclamation on the device driver icon.</span></li><li><span>If there is a yellow exclamation shown on the device driver, right click and select
<strong>Update</strong>. <strong>Update</strong> the drivers without exclamation anyways.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li><li><span>Close the window after the update is complete and check if the issue is resolved.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue persists, I suggest you to run the USB driver in
<strong>compatibility mode</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1: Compatibility mode</strong> runs the program in the current version of Windows using the settings from previous version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Download the latest driver setup file from the manufacturer’s website or locate the downloaded driver setup file of the previous operating system in your PC.</span></li><li><span><span><strong>Right-click</strong> on the driver setup file and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab, check the box
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode</strong> for, select <strong>Windows&nbsp;10</strong> operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></li><li><span>Once the driver is installed in compatibility mode,
<strong>restart</strong> the PC for the effective changes to take place.</span></li><li><span>Check if the issue is resolved.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can also follow the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard and type
<strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the top most search result and follow from step 2 from the article

            Hi Everett.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1903 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello&nbsp;xbobbydazzlerx,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how important it is for you to use our services. However, if you're using Mac operating system Snow Leopard (10.6) version, I regret to inform you, Skype will no longer work there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest version of Skype can be downloaded on <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?ps=System+re?q=system+upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mac operating system version 10.9 or higher</a>. In this case, I highly suggest to upgrade your operating system to continue using Skype. But if you can't upgrade your operating system yet, do not worry, you can still use Skype on other
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12041/what-platforms-is-skype-available-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
supported platforms</a>.</p>

<h2>            xbootmgr incomplete boot traces &#34;Couldn&#39;t find user-mode logger in active logger list.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.<br />
Hope someone in this forum can help me with this issue I'm facing...</p>
<p>I'm trying to capture boot traces using Windows Performance Toolkit xbootmgr, and I always end up getting "premerged" traces instead of a nice single "merged" trace.</p>
<p>My basic system info is as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core2 Duo P8700 @ 2.53GHz </li><li>4GB RAM </li><li>Windows 7 Ultimate x64 </li><li>Windows SDK 7.1 (only installed Windows Performance Toolkit portion) </li></ul>
<p>At the end of boot, I always end up getting an error message "Couldn't find user-mode logger in active logger list." and am left with *_km_premerge.etl and *_um_premerge.etl files.</p>
<p>Also on a side note, I noticed that when I try to view *_um_premerge.etl file, it displays a warning message that "2 buffers were lost".&nbsp; Since i couldn't find any command line switch to increase buffer numbers or size, I tried running "xbootmgr -trace boot
 -traceflags BASE" in an attempt to minimize(?) data being processed, I still end up getting the same deal.</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Ultimately, I'd like to be able to capture more detailed trace with "-traceflags BASE+CSWITCH+DRIVERS+POWER".</p>

<p>Hi, Andre.</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I did try capturing traces with minimum trace flags.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it turns out that my root cause was something else entirely...&nbsp; I noticed from my premerged trace that Windows Search service took a LOT of time, so I disabled the service and voila!&nbsp; I was able to capture the whole trace and got no errors during
 xperf processing.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention though.</p>

                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi. Few days back i upgraded to windows 10. It worked perfectly for 10-15 days....One day it started showing &nbsp;bsod(blue screen of death) errors. These included kernel security check failure , (unexpected) kernel mode trap, (unexpected)
 kmode trap , System thread extension not handled,System service exception, ERROR CODE:0xc0000001 and sometimes it says some drivers are missing etc...<br />
These stopped me from booting windows 10 or <strong>recovery CD</strong> ...i somehow managed to install windows 8.1 which didn't solve anything&nbsp;<br />
I tried everything on internet like removing graphic card driver etc but nothing seemed to work. PLEASE HELP</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing lots of issue after downgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 8.1. There might be a chance that some system files get corrupted. So, try to repair them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have Windows installation media? </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you do not have Windows 8 installation DVD, you may have to create one, boot the computer from it and then perform an Automatic Repair. To create installation media, you may refer to the article given below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Create installation media for Windows 8</span></a></span></strong></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After creating the disc, boot the computer from the disc and then try the following method to perform an Automatic Repair.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Contact the computer&nbsp;manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows 8.1 installation disk.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the “<em><strong><span>Windows Setup</span></strong></em>” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “<em><strong><span>Next</span></strong></em>”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on “<em><strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong></em>” from the lower left corner.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From the “<em><strong><span>Choose an option screen</span></strong></em>”, click on “<em><strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong></em>”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click “<em><strong><span>Advanced&nbsp;Options</span></strong></em>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If automatic repair doesn’t help to repair the startup files, you may try to repair them using these commands through Command Prompt under Advance Options.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Refer to the steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><span><span><strong>a)</strong> After you boot your computer using <strong>Windows 8 DVD
</strong>or <strong>System Repair </strong>Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.<br />
<strong>b</strong>) Select the correct time and Keyboard type. <br />
<strong>c)</strong> Click <strong>Repair your computer </strong>in the lower left corner.<br />
<strong>d</strong>) Select <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>from <strong>Choose an option
</strong>screen.<br />
<strong>e</strong>) Click <strong>Advanced options </strong>in T<strong>roubleshoot</strong> screen.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><strong>f)</strong> Click on <strong>command Prompt</strong>.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><strong>g</strong>) Type these following commands and hit enter after each line of command:
</span></span></div>
<p>
</p><div><span><span><strong>Bootrec /fixmbr</strong></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><strong>Bootrec /fixboot</strong></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><strong>Bootrec /scanos</strong></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><strong>Bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong></span></span></div>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            You should look for your old files in following folders 
<br />
<br />1. Go to C\Users and see if you are some other User who matches your user name. Get into this folder and see whether your files are there. 
<br />
<br />2. Go to C:\Windows.Old folder and look for your files here. 
<br />
<br />These folders will be hidden, so you need to make it visible by opening File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Check Hidden Items &gt; Restart your File Explorer.
<br />Now, you should traverse the folders appropriately to find your files.

<p>The transformer has air slots in both ends to allow the through flow of air, so just blow the aerosol into one end and you will be surprised at how much dust comes out of the other end.</p>
<p>Just make sure that the supply is disconnected from the mains first though!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Or if you really need a new power supply then they are available on Amazon.</p>
<p>Don`t know about Walmart as I am in the UK, but the aerosol air-duster cans should be available at any major pc &nbsp;and electronics suppliers.</p>

            Office 2007 is no longer officially supported by MS, MS no longer provides updates for it. But I have not heard that it cannot run on Win 10 FCU (Fall Creators Update).
<br />
<br />When an Office application starts, it does a check to confirm it's version is currently set to default, it Office 2007 applications are set to default. This normally is not a problem with only one installed version. But if you have applications from more than one version of Office installed, this check triggers the configuration process to set the defaults. 
<br />
<br />If the reapir does not help (I don't think it will in this case) you have 2 other "traditional" options to deal with this problem.
<br />
<br />First is "run as admin":
<br />.  *  close all other applications
<br />.  *  start one of the Office applications using "Run as Admin"
<br />.  *  allow the configuration process to complete
<br />.  *  close the application normall
<br />.  *  restart windows normally
<br />.  *  check to see if the problem is fixed
<br />
<br />The other is a registry hack. It is designed to allow you 2 run 2 versions of Office at the same time. You have to add "NoReReg" keys to the registry to defeat this feature.  If you want to do this, let us know. I can provide detailed instructions.

<h2>            Blue Screen Watchdog Error And Windows Update Errors After Clean Windows 10 Install</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC was working just fine. But for some reason I wanted a fresh Windows install. After first try it froze while updating and I had to restart it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I never managed to install Windows Update. Windows Update Assistant is downloading and installing so slow. Took over 6 hours!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I had to clean install at least 10 times today. After each install first I got Blue Screen Error than Windows Update fails downloading some updates. Then Windows Update Assistant starts. I have 50 Mbps speed but it can't download files in 1 hour.
 Moreover if pc won't freeze, it will take hours to install update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't fresh Windows 10 Install supposed to solve the existing problems? On the contrary I got this problem after re installing windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is persistent and it won't solve no matter how many times I install Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't have sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1950x Threadripper</p>
<p>
</p><p>960 GB SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>GTX1070 Ti</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asus X399 Zenith</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can force start damage hardware while installing windows? Either my hardware is damaged or there is something wrong with my router!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, otherwise I m afraid I will kill myself. It's been 14 hours!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I had Corsair Link before all of this mess. And set the RGB color of rams to white. After installing windows shouldn't it go back to factory default? This may be a cause? Also had Afterburner and GPU was overclocked and set to start as overclocked with
 restart? Can these settings be trouble from the first Windows install?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was an original windows USB I bought a couple years ago. I have installed Windows 10 multiple times without any issues. But it was old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason Windows Update decided to download and moreover install one of the updates which was preventing me. Without that update windows wouldn't recognize even the GPU. (It must be Creators Update) After that everything went as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future installations if I create a bootable USB with&nbsp;Windows Media Creation Tool, can I be safe? So there would be less updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, Windows Update succesfully downloaded and installed the files while I was creating new bootable Windows USB, which included that specific troublesome update in it. So if I did re install with this new USB, do you think it would work without any
 issues? Since the update is already in the file? I was so afraid to try it myself. To be honest, I don't think I will ever try to install windows to this computer. I hope I won't need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<p>If you will create an installation media or a bootable USB using the latest ISO of Windows 10, your copy of Windows will be upgraded to the latest version. You will still receive updates but those updates will be for the latest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used the installation media of Windows 10 to upgrade your copy of Windows 10 to the latest version, it should work without any issues. Not only it will upgrade the version of Windows 10, it will also address the blue screen error that you're encountering
 because it will replace all of the system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, are you able to update your Windows 10? Also, do you still encounter the Watchdog blue screen error? Have you created a bootable USB using the latest ISO of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>After installing that problematic update, other updates are installed as well and it's up to date now without any issues. No blue screens so far. I tried sfc /scannow and DISM commands. Other than these are they any ways to check everything is working as
 supposed to? Windows operates just fine but would love to check any broken system file etc. which will cause problems maybe in future?</p>

<p>The Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, and the System File Checker tool are the tools you can use to check for corrupted system files and image of Windows 10. These tools are enough to scan your copy of Windows 10. If these tools can't detect
 any system corruptions and you're still encountering an error, you can use the installation media that you've created to perform an in-place upgrade to fully replace the system files of Windows 10.</p>

            Hi Milan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This was a known issue in Version 1803 which I believe was subsequently resolved by a Windows Update.  So, are you presently running Version 1803 - check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About - and are you fully Updated?  Type Check for Updates in Start search and check to install and expedite all Updates to see if this resolves it.  
<br />
<br />If not go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you recently upgraded to Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:
