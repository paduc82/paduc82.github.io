<h2>            Event Log&#58; Hardware has changed from previous boot.</h2>
                    <p>Computer: HP Envy K204TX.</p>
<p>Config: Core i7 5500U/Nvidia GTX850M/8GB/1TB</p>
<p>OS:Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue description: Every time i reboot the computer, event viewer has an entry saying:-</p>
<p>"Hardware has changed from previous boot. AppId=55c92734-d682-4d71-983e-d6ec3f16059f, SkuId=e2ca509a-a2f4-498b-ba09-297685d369ac."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a laptop. Of course I have not changed a single component ever since I purchased it 3 months back from an HP Store.</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 was pre-installed in the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WINDOWS ACTIVATION doesn't fail, it still says "Windows is activated".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what is causing this strange message to show up?</p>
<p>Each restart is triggering an instance of this message in the event log. Does this mean i will eventually cross the threshold of allowed number of hardware changes and Windows will deactivate itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I AM NOT CHANGING/ HAVE NEVER CHANGED any internal component of the laptop. It's just as it was when I purchased it, didn't even upgrade RAM. Every Restart triggers this message.&nbsp; :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>I just turned the computer on, and there's another instance of "hardware has changed" message in the application log.</p>
<p>Windows is still activated. Weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I also got a BSOD last night. Here's the minidump file in case this is related to the above error.</p>
<p>It's weird, I'm getting BSODs on a brand new computer. On my second laptop which is like 5 years old now, i've never had a BSOD either with Windows 7, or with Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>I will not clear the event viewer any more, did this before i read your post.</p>
<p>And I will post another event viewer log after 2 days..</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea why the msinfo32 did not contain the information you needed, do i need to run it as administrator? This user account is NOT an administrator, i don't use administrator for regular tasks..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BSOD (system bugchecked..) was caused by a bad memory reference (null address), by an avira antivirus component (Got this from an expert in "Tom's Hardware" who analyzed my dump file, screen name: Johnbl,
<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2830473/analyze-minidump.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Tom's Hardware">
Tom's link</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Antivirus part of Comodo is NOT installed, I only use Comodo as a firewall (Windows Firewall doesn't give popup warnings when a new application is trying to connect to the internet, it either allows the connection without any notification, or shows
 a "Blocked" warning, which is not very good imo). </p>
<p>Will this still cause conflicts? Avira is only the antivirus/antispyware, and comodo is only the firewall.. All of Avira is allowed full internet access in Comodo settings, and all of comodo is defined as "Exception" in Avira settings.</p>
<p>If I remove Comodo, which Firewall shall I use? I need something like comodo, which will show a popup warning when a new application tries to connect, and allow me to configure it as outgoing only, incoming only, blocked, full access, access to specific
 ports, etc..</p>

            The interpretation of the dumpfile is not conclusive. I would like to see more dump files. Please provide the Driver View report. I do not share your view regarding the value of &nbsp;Comodo.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience that you are experiencing while dragging&nbsp;music files from iTunes to a folder. I would certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down
 the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the issue reproduced when you drag and drop from one folder to another or from a different music player/other&nbsp;application to a folder?</li><li>What exactly happens when you say, "OS stopped allowing me to drag and drop"?</li><li>Do you get any error message while 'drag and drop'? If so, what is the exact error message that you get?</li><li>Did you make any significant changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>The issue may arise due to various reasons including third party software&nbsp;intervening the movement of the media files or due to malware infection etc. In order to diagnose the issue, I would have you answer the above questions to provide you with targeted
 assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, I would suggest you to clean boot the system to rule out the possibility of a third party software conflict.</p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Issue is produced when i select multiple songs from the itunes app itself and try to drag and drop into another folder created on my desktop.</p>
<p>2. Simply doesnt load files into the folder, no error messages or secondary screens come up, just does nothing.</p>
<p>3. ^</p>
<p>4.No huge changes to my computer at all. Possibly some infected files from bad links i could have clicked on in the past month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will try clean boot, did run quick scan on avast and got rid of a few malicious files, but did not solve the problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to update the Sound card Drivers from the manufacturer’s website or you can refer to the link provided below to update the drivers for devices which are not working properly
 in Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Disable Enhancement</b></p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Sound by clicking the
<b>Start</b> button, and then clicking <b>Control Panel</b>. In the search box, type
<b>sound</b>, and then click <b>Sound</b>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the <b>
Playback</b> tab, click <b>Speakers</b>, and then click <b>Properties</b>. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the
<b>Enhancements</b> tab, and then select the <b>Disable all enhancements</b> check box.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't see an
<b>Enhancements</b> tab in the <b>Speakers Properties</b> dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you're experiencing, this typically indicates that your audio driver needs to be updated.</p>

<h2>            Keep getting disconnected from Xbox Live every few minutes HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>for the past few months (ever since we got a new internet provider) I've been getting disconnected from Xbox live every 10 minutes or so (even shorter if I am running on my xbox wireless adapter) I'm allowed to sign back in no problem but can't stay connected
 plus for some reason I can't connect to any party chats, and nobody can connect to mine</p>
<p>I talked to Xbox Live support the other day and they had me run some speed tests on my internet connection</p>
<p><strong>ping - 45ms </strong></p>
<p><strong>Download speed - 3.17mbps</strong></p>
<p><strong>Upload speed - 0.84mbps</strong></p>
<p>They told me that my upload speed is below the minimum requirements for Xbox Live and to check with my internet provider</p>
<p>So I called my tech support for my provider (Westphalia Broadband, which is a local Michigan company) and the guy said he has no idea what the problem could be its nothing on their end. I even asked if it could be my router that they supplied us with its
 a <strong>Netgear WNR1000V3 </strong>and he gave me a brilliant response "It could be the router or it might not."</p>
<p>If anyone can offer any sort of help it would be grateful, but just to let you know I don't know that much about routers or wireless networking problems</p>
<p>Also some other things to be aware of is my <strong>NAT </strong>setting is open I've tried Port forwarding and changing some
<strong>LAN settings<br />
</strong></p>

<p>PLEASE HELP ITS DRIVING ME INSANE!!!! <strong><br />
</strong></p>

            <p>This has nothing to do with RIP (Routing Information Protocol). And RIP_2B uses subnet broadcasting which is the wrong routing scheme to start with.<br /><br />Since the Netgear WNR1000V3 is only a router it means you also have a modem somewhere in your household. Could you post up the make and model of your modem as well. This is the device which i suggested you to make a direct connection to.<br /><br />Could you clear you Xbox system cache. This will remove temporary files and game updates. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here's how!</a><br /><br />Try download your gamer profile. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here's how!</a>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Appreciate if you could look up your modem down in the storage room and post up the make and model.<br /><br />When you run the speedtest, was this from a wireless or a wired (Ethernet cable)&nbsp;connection? Could you run a <a href="http://www.pingtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pingtest</a> and post up the outcome.<br /><br />Since you have manually forward netowork ports used by Xbox LIVE, ensure that you have UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) turned off.<br /><br />Keep us posted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ok well I checked and it turns out that the things in the storage room are routers they are comtrend adsl2+ ct-5621 and there are 2 of them and I think those are for the cable and not the internet. I've looked everywhere and I cannot find a modem anywhere
 the only things I have is the micro switch that has some cables running into the back of my router</p>
<p>heres the micro switch www.unicomlink.com/product-details.php?id=168</p>
<p>Its a wired (Ethernet cable) connection</p>
<p>PING: 77ms</p>
<p>JITTER: 47ms</p>

<p>The price difference comes down to the Xbox One edition requiring a "Legacy Game Controller Adapter." This adapter allows players use their existing Xbox 360 guitars and drum sets; it supports up to four controllers simultaneously, and also works with a

<p>"For PS4, no adapter is required."</p>
<p>I think this is why most point it out. &nbsp;Sure, you get the "Legacy Game Controller Adapter" for the extra $20. &nbsp;But with the PS4 these legacy game controllers just work and no adapter is required. &nbsp;Of course I do understand the extra $20 and if I still had
 some 360 instruments I planned on using I would go that route. </p>
<p>Basically they are making a deal out of the fact you can use your PS3 stuff on the 4 without the extra cost. &nbsp;If I still had my old instruments I would buy new instruments anyway. &nbsp;They had wore pretty good with all of my family playing on them. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Skype numbers exist to provide a landline number that a user can call using their phone (rather than Skype). There is no additional cost involved to receive phone calls. If you require those two things, you would purchase a Skype number. If the Skype number
 is long distance for the person calling the number, they will incur charges on their end from their phone provider. The only time anything would be free is if the person calling uses Skype to call your Skype name/Microsoft account. Skype to Skype audio/video
 calls are free. </p>

<div><span>Thanks Techfreak,</span></div>
<div><span>Since the calls I would receive are international calls those calling me would have to pay their international rate to connect to my Skype no. There would
 be no advantage.&nbsp; If they had the Skype app it would be free, but then they could call my landline no. and since I have Skype it would be detected and that call would also be free.&nbsp; Am I correct?&nbsp; Therefore why would I need a Skype no?&nbsp; If I don't how can
 I cancel it?</span></div>

    <title>Moved WinSxS to alt&#39; drive then delete it from main then moved - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Moved WinSxS to alt&#39; drive then delete it from main then moved back and now everything&#39;s gone to .... &#40;solved&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. So, I had little space on my SSD so I removed WinSxS by first stripping TrustedInstaller of access then making me the owner. Then copied it to my D: drive (just incase) then deleted it from my C: drive. Then things started to glitch and the PC had
 to be restarted properly. Then certain things like watching .movs or starting certain applications no longer worked so I moved WinSxS back to C: Drive ... it did not fix anything. I also gave Trusted Installer properly back full control and it's currently
 running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Order of functional&nbsp;fix attempts:</p>
<p>Sfc /scannow - multiple times, in safe mode and not. There are corrupted files that could not be fixed.</p>
<p>I ran DISM from admin' mode from CMD with the command DISM /Online /cleanup-image /restorehealth which said that the Windows Protection something was unable to be run.</p>
<p>Then after a few restarts while trying random solutions, I retriet /scannow and it finds no integrity violations now. And DISM no longer recognizes ''Restorehealth'' and says error 87.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non functional fix attempts:</p>
<p>The PC, since long before, has been&nbsp;unable to use the systems restore points.</p>
<p>It can not use the Windows startup repair.</p>
<p>It can not use “Refresh your PC without affecting your files.'' </p>
<p>
</p><p>Other:</p>
<p>Starting a .mov returns with a message saying that the servers failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifications:</p>
<p>Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the PC fully is not an option nor is using a USB or a disc to repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit1:</p>
<p>Applications now function. Windows Media Player do not, using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions</a> finds that the medialibrary has been damaged but, despite claiming to have done modifications, do not fix the problem.</p>
<p>Edit2:</p>
<p>After a few dozen random tutorials, Windows Media Player once again functions. Ultimately, Windows Update needed to be Windowsupdate.diagcab.</p>

            Since I already managed to fix the inability to use applications and to use the CMD, your solution is bare. My restrictions was not hindering, as there was an solution ready to be voiced--you merely avoided this: Solution is to restart Microsoft Module
 Installer then to start in safe-mode to use CMD to scan the PC. This solved one part of the equation, your solution was to avoid solving by reverting.

<h2>            Windows 10&#59; Cortana not working properly in the UK</h2>
                    <p>Hi, when I first upgraded to Windows 10 a two or three months ago, Cortana was working perfectly and answered 99% of my questions; However, for technical reasons, I've just reinstalled Windows 10 using the same DVD that I first created with the M$ media
 tool that I first used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i could ask questions like, sing me a song, what's my name, sing happy birthday to me and, Cortana would answer my questions correctly and sing my requests but now, that does not happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After setting up Cortana, including mic, which was successful, I can ask Cortana question after question but more often that not, I get the response, "sorry, I didn't get that" or, I am directed to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's a gimmick but I kind of like it so, why is it no longer working for me?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Cortana is still not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As already stated in my first post, when I first upgraded to Windows 10, after setting up the 'mic', Cortana worked flawlessly and answered every question I asked her, though occasionally, she launched a webpage with the info if she was unsure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could ask her such questions as, 'sing me a song', 'sing happy birthday to me' or 'what's my name' and she would do as I had asked but now I'm getting, 'sorry I didn't get that'&nbsp;or 'try again later'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise it's a gimmick but I do enjoy using it but because of a technical issue, I had to re-install Windows 10 again and, despite the fact that my country, locale, language and 'mic' are setup properly (UK), it's not really working properly so I've turned
 it off.</p>
<p>

I don't want to double up on troubleshooting steps so could you please tell us specifically what steps you've taken so far?&nbsp;I&nbsp;see you mention "every possible troubleshooting method"&nbsp;and even "obscure troubleshooting methods"&nbsp;but we'd like to know for sure what you have tried so we're not asking you to repeat steps.</p><p><br /></p><p>Additionally, can you provide us with your networking information? Including your networking hardware information (make and model), ISP, and if you're using a wired or wireless connection. </p><p><br /></p><p>Having all that will help us see what we can try next so do keep us posted! :)</p><p>

            <p>Thanks for that extra information! Definitely sounds like you've run the gamut with troubleshooting which is both good and bad. Good that you've tried a lot, bad that it doesn't seem much is working. </p><p><br /></p><p>One thing I don't see mentioned is potentially trying your console on a different network (preferably not Rogers and not one with a Hitron box). Do you have any friends that are using a different network that would let you test your console on their network? If that's not an option, you can try using a smartphone as a hot-spot temporarily to test the download speeds. It won't be an exact match, obviously, but you can run speed tests to see what you should be getting on that connection and compare it. </p><p><br /></p><p>Still trying to rule out everything we possibly can here; your patience is very much appreciated. :)</p><p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">--------------------------------------</p><p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0">&nbsp;

            <p>Hmmmm okay, that's interesting. Are you near a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a> by any chance? If you are, I'd recommend bringing your console in and explaining that you're having network issues on multiple different networks. You can ask them to test it there in store to see if they're able to replicate the issue as well. If so, I'd suggest asking if they can replace the console for you in-store so you don't have to wait for an exchange through the mail. Do note that if you're outside of the warranty period, you may have to pay a fee for the exchange.</p><p><br /></p><p>Good luck and keep us posted. :)</p><p>

    <title>How to utilize the second hard drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jk tangpuz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to utilize the second hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    I have a MSI GT72S Dominator Pro G Dragon Edition. This particular computer has three hard drives and a Windows 10 Home 64 bit OS. Two of which are 128 GB M.2&nbsp;NVMe PCIe&nbsp;SSD in RAID-0 format (which becomes one 256 GB M.2 SSD) and where the OS software drivers
 are installed. The last one is a 1 TB SATA Drive III for extra storage. My question is since the OS and other essential software drivers are installed in the first two SSD drives (in RAID-0 format), how do I set my computer so that my downloads (music, videos,
 pictures, etc.) and my games (Steam and Origin) are installed and saved to my 1 TB SATA Drive III?

            <p>Hi JK Tangpuz. You can move the content of your personal libraries, such as Videos, Music, Documents, etc. by right clicking on the libraries and going to properties. In the location tab you will find a box where you can enter the location for the library.
 Simply point all the libraries to the new location. So if your 1TB is called D:\ in windows, simply change the C:\ to D:\ and click the move button. This will become the new default save location for your personal data. As for steam, during the installation
 of the program change the install path to the 1TB drive. After steam is installed right click on the steam icon in your System Tray and go to "Settings". In the Settings click on 'Downloads', c;lick on the 'Steam Library Folders' button. Make sure your steam
 library folder is pointing to the 1TB drive.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>By default the Edge and other browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox downloads to the 'Downloads' personal library. If you move the library to another drive you won't have to make any changes in the browser settings. If you are unsure how to
 install software, it would be best to ask someone who knows how install software. Each piece of software is different and there is no way of anyone on here telling how to do it. Generally during the installation procedure for a piece of software the installer
 will give an option to install into a different volume or path, but that's not always the case.</p>

 limited data quota. I find that in win 10 that I am not able to turn on the metered connection setting for that tethered connection until I am actually connected to that connection. I do this a quickly as possible but I found that win 10 immediately resumed
 the big update download on a LTE (4G) connection and consumed most of my data quota before I had managed to get the metered connection setting enabled. Even after turning the metered setting to on, the download did not instantly stop but I needed to shut down
 and restart win 10 it seems to make it recognize the change in the status of the connection. Is this just because the download had already started on the home wifi and the shut down and restart was needed to make win update ch

 metered connection? I know that I can do things like turn off the data on the mobile phone while I sort out the metered connection but failing that it seems that by default Win 10 will suck up most of your mobile data before you have a chance to turn on the
 metered setting. Can't this setting be made to be on for ALL new wifi connections and then you selectively turn it off?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By default, metered connection for Windows 10 is turned off. Whenever you connect to a wired/wireless connection, you have to enable it manually. What happened to this situation, is that the update is already running before we have turned the metered connection
 on. It may take you moments before it will recognize the command. That’s the reason why it only took effect after you restarted your computer. Moving forward, we can set the metered connection to every wired/wireless connection that we need to limit.</p>

            <p>Thanks Sherry for your response. Can I confirm that turning the metered connection on when there is already and active MS Update Service download happening should stop that download within 'some moments' and that there is no need to drop and then reconnect
 to the now metered wifi connection or reboot the computer? It did not appear to be the case as a hundred MB continued to be downloaded after&nbsp;I changed the setting and it did only stop because I dropped the connection (and restarted just to be safe). You mention
 that we can set the metered connection option for every wired/wireless connection. Do you mean we can make a global setting for this or do you mean that we have to manually do it and only after connecting to each network for each and every connection we make?
 I am pretty sure that you can make this setting for each wifi only connection (not wired)&nbsp;using the command line without having to have the connection active but I did not think it was possible using the Settings program where you seem to have to be connected
 to that wifi network to be able to make the change and of course if that wifi is a hotspot on a fast mobile connection at LTE speed you run the risk of consuming a lot of data (whether that is MS update data or some other user process data). It is a real nuisance
 and three times&nbsp;now I have consumed my entire month's allowance of mobile data because I have changed handset or router without thinking about the new wifi and Windows has invariably started a sizable update. I think that area of the update service could be
 improved to make that less frustrating, I am sure I am not the only one frustrated at disappearing mobile data.</p>

<p>Sherry about wired and metered connections as it isn't setup to use on Windows 10 without a registry change please advise, as people will be asking why can't I set up on a wired connection.</p>

Windows 10 is an operating system designed to take full advantage of an internet connection without any restrictions on how much bandwidth it uses to perform tasks, such as download drivers and updates, sync settings, connect with cloud services, let you get
 access to the World Wide Web, and everything else.</p>

            Thanks Joe, that clears up the issue with the wired connections. Although I have a few old mobile broadband modem/ routers, I rarely use these with a wired Ethernet connection and was not too concerned about not having that metered option in the Settings
 app for the wired connections. As luck would have it tho, the lack of this option just cost me another full month's quota. It went like this: Apple is serving up a major update to the iOS on the iPhone. Thankfully the iPhone only gets this big (1GB or so I
 think) when connected to a network other than over its own mobile phone network. So I turn off the hotspot&nbsp;wifi tethering and I plug this iPhone into the Win 10 laptop to back the phone up to the iTunes app and in doing so,&nbsp;Win 10 configures the drivers for
 a USB connected modem using the iPhone, which as far as Win 10 is concerned, is just another wired Ethernet connection and in seeing this new 'wired' connection, it happily starts up the Win 10 update yet again and there goes the

<h2>            Keyboard Typing Random Letters</h2>
                    <p>Help! I don't know what happened but my keyboard will type seemingly random letters/number every time&nbsp;you push any key (even same key multiple times). I have gone into the computer's keyboard settings and switched languages from and back to the original
 English settings and nothing has changed. The odd thing is that it works on some programs and not others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works on:</p>
<p>Chrome, File Explorer, Internet Passwords, Steam, Spotify, iTunes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't work on:</p>
<p>Microsoft Settings, Cortana, Microsoft Store, OneNote, Sticky Notes, Calendar, Audible, Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The trend is that it doesn't work on <em>most </em>Microsoft Applications but it does on the other Apps</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typical bank debit cards are VISA cards.&nbsp; VISA also do Credit Cards as well.&nbsp; Perhaps your bank card is just a cash-point&nbsp; card?&nbsp; What Indian bank is your account with?<br />

            We appreciate you providing us the results of the troubleshooting methods Melchizedek gave you.<br />
<br />
Have you tried creating another administrator account to see if the error message in installing the update will still appear? If not, here's
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how to create another administrator account</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If the same issue persists, you may <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download the media creation tool</a></strong> and use it to repair your Windows 10.<br />

<h2>            Windows maps voice</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have problem with Windows Maps (Mapy in Czech) on my home buildt&nbsp;computer. It is not speaking to me. No voice directions at all. I tried to reinstall it, nut no help. Weird thing is that i have them also in my Lumia 930 and there is working with no problems.
 Desired language of voice direction is Czech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HW is:</p>
<p>Gigabyte MB with integrated CPU, GA-D525TUD with 4GB of RAM and SSD disk.</p>
<p>SW:</p>
<p>Last Windows 10 version, not Insider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is really appreciated. Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Divya</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply!</p>
<p>I run the tool, only thing it founds was that UAC was turned off, i turn it back on to see if it will help. Unfortunately situation is still the same. I can run maps, donwlonad offline maps, have maps direction. But no voice. Also i can not find nothing
 about voice directions in maps settings. I remember that in here and all other navigations i need to download voice directions at first.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for answer!</p>
<p>I tried this, still nothing changed. I can play music like system sound or my music collection w/o problems, even before this. Driver has instaleed the same as before after removing and readding&nbsp;device.</p>
<p>My guess is that this is related directly to Maps universal app.</p>

            The Maps app will only provide voice instructions on devices with GPS signal so it is expected that you're not getting voice instructions on your PC.

<p>Hi there </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have struggled with this problem on two W10 tablets (Lenovo Thinkpad 8 and Toshiba Encore 8) both with a GPS- sensor enabled - according to settings.</p>
<p>Both tablets are upgraded&nbsp;from windows 8.1 (and Here-drive app)</p>
<p>I suspect that a later Windows 10 update is preventing the MAPS-app to find the GPS signal somehow. I have tried other apps which use the GPS-signal, and they don't work neither.</p>
<p>Symptoms are: No voice directions at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regard Henrik</p>

            <p>The GPS device needs to integrate properly into Windows Location Services otherwise the Maps app won't be able to see it's location.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say that navigation works, do you actually see the location moving on the map as you move and the instructions changing as you move through the route automatically?</p>

            If you tap/click on the instruction bar at the top, do you hear anything? Make sure you don't have the instructions muted by opening the ... menu.

<h2>            Microsoft support for Argentina Countrie</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span><span>I bought a Surface Pro 256gb in England, but I came back to Argentina (were I live) and then I realized that my Surface Pro has the grounding electrical issue. I saw that Microsoft
 is replacing the Surface Pro with this issue, but my question is if I have the same support here in Argentina, because I can not return to England just to replace the Surface.
<br />
<br />
PD: Can the Surface Pro be damaged for this grounding issue? <br />
<br />
Thank you. <br />
<br />
Kevin Young <br />
