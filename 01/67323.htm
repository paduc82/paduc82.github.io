<h2>            Trouble with two Xbox Wireless Adapters on one Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>At home, I have the following setup:</p>
<p>One PC with windows 10 in my office. On this PC I've plugged a Xbox Wireless adapter in order to play with an Xbox One controller. This works fine.</p>
<p>In my living room I have a NVIDIA Shield TV on which I've plugged a second Xbox Wireless adapter. I use the virtualhere software (https://virtualhere.com/) between the PC and the Shield to enable the controllers in the living room to be "virtually" connected
 to the office. When I activate virtualhere, the adapter of the Shield appears as being plugged into the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot use my controllers because windows cannot start the second adapter. In device manager I see the two Xbox Wireless adapters being plugged but one has an error code 10 (cannot start this device) and thus attached controllers cannot be
 used.<br />
</p>
<p>You can reproduce the issue by simply plugging two xbox wireless adapter on the same PC.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>If someone has a clue to solve this issue, I will be grateful !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me explain the error code and proceed with the troubleshooting steps accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The error ‘Code 10’ occurs for a device, when there is a need to update the drivers for that particular device. Typically, the device’s hardware key contains a “FailReasonString” value and the value string displays an error message defined by the hardware
 manufacturer. If the hardware key does not contain a “FailReasonString” value, the error ‘Code 10’ is displayed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to follow this article to ‘<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Update drivers in Windows 10</span></a>’, kindly follow
 the steps to update the Xbox Wireless Adapter drivers and check if it works for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update the driver there is no change.</p>
<p>I think there is a bug in windows 10 when you plug 2 Xbox wireless adapter on the same machine.</p>
<p>I can plug one adapter at a time without any issue</p>

    <title>Mail - account management and missing emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oceansidemommy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail - account management and missing emails</h2>
                    <p>Last night my wife (this is her husband explaining her issues) got her link for Windows 10 on her Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>The Surface is her primary computer and she used the Windows 8.1 mail client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the upgrade:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Once the email client connected and accepted her credentials, all of her past messages (stored on her surface) were gone.&nbsp; How do we get to her past email file, does this require a rollback?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. She uses a 3rd party email that we would like to discuss on the phone not on a public forum.&nbsp; Apparently the mail client had trouble being configured, and there are now 4 copies of this account (two not working) and there doesn't appear to be a way to
 clean up the duplicates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're currently on hold to attempt to get someone to assist with these issues on the phone...</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>

            <p>Making progress.</p>
<p>2. Regarding deleting duplicate or old email accounts from the email client.&nbsp; Go to the bottom left corner and select the Settings icon.&nbsp; This will open a tab on the right showing all of the email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the duplicate/unwanted email account and go to 'Change settings'.</p>
<p>This will open a dialog and one of the options for the account selected is to delete the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1A - I have to split problem 1 into two.&nbsp; For the missing inbox messages we just needed to adjust the account settings, increasing the frequency of polling but more importantly increasing the time frame from which messages should be pulled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1B - sent items.&nbsp; This is a pop account and while sent items were saved on the client, they weren't saved on the server.&nbsp; Thus all of the sent items are still missing.&nbsp; I suspect this may require a roll back and export to resolve - but I'm back on hold with
 Tech Support.</p>

            <div>It's too bad there isn't a 'NOT helpful' mark it would be great for that previous reply on this thread.</div>
<div>
<p>1. This machine and Oceanside Mommy were not in the early adoption program and weren't looking to be.&nbsp; The upgrade was done after the launch with the release version only.&nbsp; I'll assume you have a canned response for email issues.</p>
<p>2. The issue had nothing to do with the inbox, we resolved that this issue was with Sent items, the ones generated on this device.&nbsp; I'll assume you didn't fully read the message which has shown what worked and what didn't work in diagnosing the original
 issue.</p>
<div>3. The software used and which had a problem was "Microsoft Mail", what 3rd party software are we talking about.&nbsp; Is your response meant to imply that people using email servers other than Exchange or Office 365 should expect Microsoft to be unable to
 support them with Microsoft products?&nbsp; I'll go with you just don't have a good answer since you don't appear to have paid attention before responding.</div>
<div>-----<br />
However I'd like to offer everyone else who may read this an updated status.<br />
The rollback occured last night.&nbsp; While it didn't take long after rolling back the Mail, Calendar and People applications all failed to work correctly.&nbsp; Each would open and immediately shut down.</div>
<div>So I would say the rollback was a Fail.&nbsp; Because of another issue related to inconsistent network (probably not rollback related but we need to move onward) we have returned to Windows 10.&nbsp; All good except of course that only the primary account on the
 machine can log out - everyone else can't select that item off the start menu as it closes as soon as their account is selected.&nbsp; We use the Windows Key + "L" to allow for switching accounts.</div>

<h2>            System Error on installation of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Window 10 64 bit Home on 29 July 2015. Since then on starting the Note book the following message is displayed:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>ColorUService.exe-System Error</p>
<p>The program can't start because MSVCP100.dll is missing from your computer. Try to reinstalling the program to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to Windows 10 my Notebook was operating on Windows 8.1 without any issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>In view of above I would request you to please help me in resolving this problem. Also please identify the program which is to be reinstalled.&nbsp;</p>

This repair did not work. &nbsp;It gave me a new problem to add to the other. &nbsp;Now a small box appears with the heading: &nbsp; C:\Windows32\System32\cdpreference.exe &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How do I repair the new problem? &nbsp;If I dump Windows 10 and go back to 8.1 will the problems go
 away? &nbsp;Frustrating and a lot of wasted time....

            In regards to my earlier post above, after the first day the small box that was popping up is now gone. &nbsp;I'm unsure if it was something I did trying to figure it out, since I was in and out of different areas for hours. &nbsp;This morning the original problem
 was still active. &nbsp;My Asus notebook did an update to the touch pad which seems to have taken care of the problem. &nbsp;The problem hasn't returned after turning it off and on the last three times. &nbsp;Could that be where the problem exists? &nbsp;If people try to update
 the mouse / touch pad driver will the problem disappear? &nbsp;I don't know, but my computer is running correctly again, &nbsp;No longer peaved now!

            <p>&nbsp; To update the Asus touchpad, open all apps, &nbsp;Click on ASUS, go down to ASUS Live Update. &nbsp;The click yes in the new box that popped up asking if you want it to make changes to your computer. &nbsp;You'll get a new window with your update status. &nbsp;Click on Check
 for Updates and it will list any available, or tell you you're up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't help, right click on the small window in the bottom left corner. &nbsp;Click on Device manager. &nbsp;Click on the small arrow next to Mice and other pointing devices. &nbsp;Then double click on Asus Touchpad. &nbsp;Click on the driver tab, then on Update driver.
 &nbsp;Hopefully this will have helped.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Recovery &#39;Go Back to Win 7&#39; option not available after automatic &#40;unrequested&#41; install of Win 10. WHY&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>HP EliteBook PC with Windows 7 Home Premium (refurb unit). The hard drive is SSD (128 GB) and WAS partitioned with a&nbsp; recovery disk (D).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded the bare-bones unit for a friend by installing Norton Security, Firefox, Microsoft Office and a few other odds and ends products/tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied all the updates that were available via Windows Update before turning the unit back to its owner. This was at the end of November/early December '15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unit was then given as a Christmas present to users who are NOT power users or risk takers when using the unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime in the last week, Windows 10 was installed (unsolicited, mind you!) during an update process. The users do not wish to use Win 10 and when I accessed the Recovery function , 'Go Back'
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is not listed </span>as an option. Also, the partitioned hard drive is now a single partition (C).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the recovery partition gone? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is 'Go Back' only available if there are Recovery/Backup datasets available in the recovery partition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either there is faulty documentation regarding Recovery capability or, someone needs to add significant information</p>
<p>to that documentation to list all the things that will no-op recovery from a Win 10 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any information that can be provided!</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I understand that you have an issue with going back to previous operating System after upgrading to Windows 10. I will surely help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a month after you upgrade to <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, you’ll be able to go back to your previous version of Windows from
<span><strong>Settings</strong></span><strong> &gt; <span>Update &amp; security</span> &gt;
<span>Recovery</span></strong>. This will keep your personal files, but it'll remove apps and drivers installed after the upgrade, as well as any changes you made to settings.
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>To go back, you'll need to:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep everything in the windows.old and $windows.~bt folders after the upgrade.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Remove any user accounts you added after the upgrade.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Know the password you used to sign in to Windows&nbsp;7 or <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> (if you used one).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Have the USB drive you used to upgrade to <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> (if you used one).
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to refer the section </span><strong><span>Go back to your previous version of Windows
</span></strong><span>from the following article.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this information helps. Reply to the post with an updated status of the issue so that we can assist you further.</span></p>

<h2>            &#91;PREVIEW MEMBER&#93; Xbox One Bricked after Preview Update</h2>
                    <p>After turning on my xbox after having it offline for a while I was prompted for an update. Considering everything I okayed it and updated the console. Upon completing the update my console has been completely unresponsive apart from the xbox logo lighting up on the front and being able to eject game discs. I get no feed to any tv through any HDMI. I've done all the basic steps including hard rebooting and rebooting into safe mode none of which so much as prompted the screen on. To reiterate. It was working just fine before I updated it earlier today.</p>

 perto do meu cão , mas , eu estava no modo pacifico ! e no modo pacifico não ha monstros e ai eu achei estranho e ai meu cachorro desapareceu eu peguei mais 2 cachorros e ai eles não desapareceram eu achei que tendo a mesma quantidade de gatos e cachorros

 caes e o cao que ele na o atacou nao desapareceu e ai eu consegui outro cachorro e eu deixei os dois na minha casa e eu fui me aventurar um pouco e quando voltei eles desapareceram outra vez que isso aconteceu foi quando eu fui pescar e eu levei 3 gatos e

<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/pt-br/f/491/t/1513793.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.xbox.com/pt-br/f/491/t/1513793.aspx</a>):</p>
<p>Herobrine de certa forma realmente existiu até a 1.6.6 beta, no alpha havia um Mob &nbsp;de ser humano, mas esse mob foi eliminado na 1.4.4 alpha &nbsp;no entanto certa partes de sua programação ficaram (e sua Skin também) ele meramente seguia o jogador e por um erro
 na skin seus olhas ficaram brancos. o resto dos códigos foram eliminados na beta 1.6.6</p>
<p>Tudo em todos os jogos tem um textura ou seja um imagem que é "dobrada" no formato do jogo as vezes com milhares de dobras, mas no caso de Minecraft poucas, essas imagens ficam no código do jogo, e não existe uma do Herobrine.</p>
<p>Quanto a Lenda é mentira &nbsp;Noctch não tem irmão, ele mesmo disse no twitte: Getting loads of tweets and emails about Herobrine again. I don't have a dead brother, and he never was in the game. Not real. Never was"</p>
<p>Traduzindo :"Recebendo muitos de tweets e e-mails sobre Herobrine novamente. Eu não tenho um irmão morto, e ele nunca esteve no jogo. Não é real. Nunca foi".</p>
<p>Dito isso sabemos que ele não existe mas a propagação da lenda se deve a 2 grandes fatores:</p>
<p>1) Farsa: alguém viu o primeiro vídeo e fez outro usando truques de edição ou um Mod, e outro viu o falso e fez outro, e assim em diante</p>
<p>2) Erro de identificação: digamos que quando você acreditou na lenda (por causa do 1º fator), você acaba vendo o que quer ver, viu um zombie de longe e achou que era o Herobrine, esse fator é ampliado no Xbox por não acompanhar as atualizações de Pc, quando
 ele atualiza nem todos sabem o que foi acrescentado(por exemplo www silva viu um villager zombie foram adicionados na atualização 1.4)</p>
<p>E tem mais um coisa, não vou descarta totalmente que ele existe no Xbox, não é possível ver os códigos de programação e procurar sua textura ele pode ter sido acrescentado pela 4J, mas isso é muito improvável</p>

<p>Eu estou tendo um parecido,meus animais somem na minha fazenda, eu estava jogando e procurando ferro, quando voltei vi os animais, porém só tinha um de cada espécie, 2 vacas e 2 vacas cogumelos,mas eu tinha um monte de cada animal, e minha cerca era bem
 grande (4 blocos de altura, pois eu tbm tinha galinhas) dai eu fui dormir e espera q de manhã eles voltassem. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 ovelha em cima da cerca tentando fugir,mas a cerca era bem alta, fui chegar os outros animais minhas vacas cogumelos nao estavam lá. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*NOTA: minha cerca era composta por uma pedra como base depois tinha a cerca e depois outras 2 pedras em cima totalizando
 4 blocos de altura.</p>

</p>
<p>O herobrine nunca raptou animais entao eu acho que talvez seja um novo vilão do jogo , tipo alguém pra ficar no lugar do herobrine

<p>Eu não sei se tem a ver com o tutorial, mas sempre que eu jogo no tutorial e eu acho um disco de música as letras ficam mais grossas, e em um dia antes de desaparecerem meus animais joguei o tutorial e achei um disco de música. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Não acho que seja
 o Herobrine, as vezes é um Bug, ou um novo vilão como você disse.</p>

<h2>            re imaging a machine in asus</h2>
                    <div>
<blockquote>Ok, so heres the story. i bought this laptop (specs are posted below) and it came with a nightmare installed windows 8.1, i immediately did the windows 10 upgrade, for multiple reasons,
 starters, ive been a computer tech for 20 years, and f**k windows 8. i decided to test play 10 because it was free. now the website for asus does not have drivers made for this hardware previous to windows 8 and i am pretty much stuck running windows 8 or
 10. <br />
which i am not but anyway....<br />
i have live image discs for windows 7 ultimate 64bit. and windows XP SP3. i would prefer to put XP and Crunchbang11. final release side by side, or to have win7 and ubuntu 12.4 side by side on it, however my concern before i begin this project is that the asus
 website offers no video,sound,wificard,diskdrive,hdmiport etc etc drivers. they have them for win8 and for win 10, but not for 7 or xp, which are the OS systems i prefer to run. i was wondering if anyone here might be able to offer me a solution to my inability
 to find compatible drivers for xp or windows 7 for this hardware. i really despise 8 and 10 is almost as bad as vista.... its better than 8 and its better than vista and its better than 2000, but its still in the same category in my mind. if its not 98/95/xp/7
 (im leary of windows 7 anyway but its stable atleast. 10 is not stable... ive almost lost my D: partition twice because of windows 10 critical errors.)
<br />
<br />
What im totally asking for is driver support for my entire system for windows xp or windows 7 ultimate 64x.
<br />
i am currently running windows 10, upgraded from 8.1.<br />
<br />
please help me, i really really want to put XP on here more than anything but i will settle for win7 ultimate 64x. i can handle the linux stuff on my own or through ubuntu support forums, but for windows. i trust majorgeeks.com. ive been attending your site
 since i was 7 years old, when my mother sent me here for spybot 1.6. <br />
<br />
the specs are<br />

Yet again i just want to put XP on here or win7... any help trying to know what to do before i start the re-imaging process would be very appreciated. also want to say, i tried running ubuntu16 side by side with win 10 on here already and had to remove ubuntu
 because the windows bootloader purposefully prevented ubuntu from booting and purposefully destroyed the linux grub. **** windows 10 they are trying to prevent unix systems from being given to the public, and i hate them for it. im sick of microsoft and my
 new favorite words in the microsoft world is "no longer supported. final stable release."

            <p>The Computer/laptop or Hardware Manufacturers are the ones to see about Driver supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simple fact is that if a Laptop, etc manufacturer releases a new 8.1 or 10 laptop, they don't write or supply drivers for 2000, XP, etc.</p>

<h2>            Missing Sea of Thieves skins</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody.<br />
<br />
I've been watching on Mixer some promotional streams in hope to get some skins for a little bit now. (lvl 86 on there now)<br />
So I watched the latest stream in hope that I get the Ebon flintlock skin.<br />
It's not there, and the previous one I tried to get was the Sniper version.<br />
<br />
Some info about my situation :<br />
- I was there before the stream even started and watched it entirely on the Xbox channel (for the pistol skin)<br />
- My account is linked, I tried unlinking and linking again, it changed nothing.<br />
- I already contacted Sea of Thieves's support about this, to no avail.</p>
<p>- Nothing from Mixer appears in my order history.<br />
<br />
I highly believe that it must be an issue on Mixer's/Xbox side of things. <br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks alot and have a nice day.<br />
<br />
EDIT :&nbsp;<span>Thanks everybody for the answers.</span></p>
<span>I started looking around on Mixer and saw a notification that caught my eye. Surprise surprise I got the pistol skin today, so 8 days after the stream.</span><br />

            It usually takes up to 2 weeks to receive the items after the event has ended. I would check your messages from Xbox Live as well.

<p>Oh so its two weeks now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was 7 days yesterday but I guess since that date passed its now 14 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny, nearly everyone who got it, got it after the first few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the vexed people are not going to be quiet, and since all we're getting is copy pasted&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed- Inappropriate]
</strong>for answers. We're not satisfied. This is not something expensive or even difficult to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are just refusing to do so, Rare stated that everyone who tuned in would get the skin. So send the skin to all accounts logged into mixer during those hours, there, you've guaranteed no one missed out on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is beyond bad customer support.</p>

            Was able to return to Windows 7 and do a clean re-installation of 7. and a complete image back-up. Win10 then installed with a few glitches which were sorted out by a computer tech. In my opinion, MS should never have rammed this OS through. It has caused
 problems.&nbsp;

<p>Hello, my problem seems to be similar to many other users however the solution posed to them is due to the HDD not being official, mine is (even has the microsoft logo when selecting it from the memory menu on xbox dashboard :P). So as you can see i'm not
 sure what to do from here, i think my xbox 360 is uptodate however the console fails to recognise the BC update both the USB version and CD-R version so i'm not too sure on that one. Any help on what to try from here would be greatly appriciated, thanks.

<p>Do you have any Xbox Original games that DO work on your console? Also, when and where was the HDD purchased? And as for the update, what happens when you try and update? Are you encountering an error message or code? If so, what does it say, exactly?

Windows Live Mail doesn't import Outlook pst messages even if installed.<br />

<p>Clean boot.&nbsp;&nbsp; No 3rd party app seems to be involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>In Task Scheduler, Recovery Environment, every two weeks or so, Microsoft runs a task. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>It gets Disabled right after every time Microsoft runs such task.<br />
</p>
<p>For example, now it is again Disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Details:<br />

            Was the system factory reset after he bought it? 
<br />
<br />Make sure that was done:

<br />
<br />You can also right click setup for each software program then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running the file again.

            Hi  John,
<br />
<br />Adobe Creative Cloud should install on that system without any issues at all.
<br />
<br />What error(s) are they seeing when trying to install Avast and Adobe CC - please provide the specific error(s)
<br />
<br />There is one thing that might be stopping then installing 3rd party applications:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />Check the Windows Edition, are they running Windows 10 S
<br />
<br />Windows 10 S can only be user to install Windows Store apps, they need to swap over to Windows 10 Pro

<h2>            Can I please use my PC microsoft&#63;&#40;Compatibility telemetry&#41;</h2>
                    I'm getting tired of having to always end the process "microsoft compatibility telemetry" through task manager whenever I want to use my PC for anything at all. I have disabled all possible log etc. sending to microsoft, but yet there it is. It also seems
 to appear at the worst possible times, for example I can be watching series for several hours, but the minute I launch a game the bloody bugger's back! Does it just check when the PC is under load and then instantly launches its most horrific attacks on my
 poor disk drive? Do I have to take some sort of extreme measures and delete registry keys or what?

    <title>Windows Explorer freezes while viewing or moving pictures. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arrrgghhh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer freezes while viewing or moving pictures.</h2>
                    This past week, Windows Explorer has starting acting odd. I am sorting out about 3 gigs worth of various photos and suddenly Windows is taking a long time when labeling them or moving them from folder to folder. Sometimes it takes a full minute to move
 one tiny photo. Sometimes the browser simply freezes while moving the selected photos. Even worse, the photo remains inn the photo as not moved. I have to refresh the folder to entirely remove the moved photos. Sometimes the mouse flickers while moving, and
 I can't do anything until it stops it. I tried virus scans, checking add-ons, nothing works.<br />
<br />
Another annoyance - the folders will not stop auto-expanding. I turned off this function and it still does it.
<br />
<br />
I'm using Windows Ultimate 7 on my laptop. What the heck is going on? HELP! :)<br />

<h2>            Cast to Device Shut Down</h2>
                    I love that I can 'cast to device' to my home theatre, but how do I shut it down after I'm done? &nbsp;Once I start my home theatre will switch right back to the home function where it receives the cast, but when I try to switch to a different input, it switches
 right back to 'home'. &nbsp;How do i manually end the 'casting' to prevent this from happening?

    <title>Surface dock crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> churchillss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface dock crash</h2>
                    <p>Since updating my Surface Pro 4 with the latest windows update, it crashes whenever I connect it to my surface dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update my surface dock with the latest drivers, but this is proving impossible as in order for me to do this I need to connect the surface 4 to the dock, causing it to crash almost immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried connecting the dock to a Surface book and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is a firmware issue, how can I update the firmware on the dock, without it being connected to the Surface 4 or to the Surface book?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any help</p>
                </div>

<p>Try doing it in Safe mode without networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming you already have the Surface dock tool installed on your Surface. If not here is a link:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46703</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the tool first without the dock being connected and then after you install the software reboot your surface into safe mode without networking and then run the tool.</p>
