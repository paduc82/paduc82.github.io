<h2>            WMC changes firewall rule when I try to add an extender so no boxes are checked...then the add extender fails, how do I fix&#63;</h2>
                    Alright I have been experiencing troubles with adding an extender for windows media center. When I add an xbox360 extender the driver installs successfully and then I receive a configuration error in windows media center.
<a href="http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/ae122/Radical924/Web%20Posts%20-%20Not%20Halo%20Maps/MediaCenterExtenderConfigurationError.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u><b>SEE HERE</b><br />
</u></a><br />
I noticed that when this configuration error happens my windows firewall media extender rules change so that no boxes are checked off next to media extender.<br />

<br />
I am not sure why this happens or if this is related to any other problems I've been having listed
<b><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/wmc-problems-videos-not-showing-up-some-music/1329ad6d-e8c7-4fdf-a4c6-3437cef6ac18">here</a></b>.<br />
<br />
I have tried:<br />
<br />
1. Uninstalling and Reinstalling WMP and WMC<br />
2. Deleting all firewall rules for Media Extenders and Re-adding them<br />
3. Turning Media Streaming On and Off in WMP<br />
4. Turning Windows Firewall off (Yet the changes to the firewall still happen and affect the installation of the media extender even if the firewall is off)<br />
5. Disconnecting Internet from router.<br />
6. Deleting WMC extender Certificates in MMC<br />
7. Deleting WMC program data<br />
8. Deleting WMC and WMP appdata<br />
9. Deleting Mcx User account<br />
10. Restarting Windows Firewall Service<br />

            Okay I was talking to a Windows Media Center Support Representative on the phone and we found out that my DEFAULT User account profile was corrupt...My
<b>ntuser.dat</b> file was missing!<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I figured it out! Anyone else experiencing this issue follow my post:<br />
<br />
<p>I have err HAD! the exact same issue....and I figured out what it was. Apparently wmc needs to create a new user profile if you are configuring an extender and my
<strong>ntuser.dat</strong> located under <strong>C:\Users\DEFAULT</strong> was missing! This file is essential for creating ALL new user profiles and wmc needs this file there to properly create the Media Center Extender Profile (You can hide the Mcx folder
 later). So in order to see if this is your problem navigate to <strong>C:\Users\DEFAULT</strong> folder and inside you will see a
<strong>ntuser.dat</strong> file, if not here is what you need to do (Make sure to click view &gt; Show hidden Files and Folders).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Okay so if your <strong>ntuser.dat</strong> is missing your registry key might still be saved! So in order to save yourself the time of doing a full system restore you can just go to regedit instead! (What a relief) Now navigate to
<strong>HKEY_Users</strong> and make sure the <strong>.DEFAULT </strong>registry key with subfolders is there- if it is you are in luck!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now open command prompt by typing <strong>cmd</strong> in the windows 7 search bar and right-click and click Run as Administrator. Now what we are going to do you see is create a new
<strong>ntuser.dat</strong> file from the <strong>.DEFAULT</strong> registry key! So in command prompt navigate to C:Windows\System32 by typing in
<strong>cd c:\windows\system32</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now type in this command prompt command: <strong>reg save HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT "C:\users\%USERNAME%\desktop\ntuser.dat" /y [/c]</strong></p>
<p>So now a new uncorrupted <strong>ntuser.dat</strong> file should be on your desktop. COPY it to the
<strong>C:\Users\DEFAULT</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Make sure the security permissions for the <strong>C:\Users\DEFAULT </strong>folder are set to SYSTEM Full Control, Administrators Full Control, and Everyone Read.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now try creating a new user profile and if it works then your media center extender service should work with no problems after these next few steps!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Type in the windows search bar: services.msc and click on services. When the UAC control pops-up click okay. Now scroll down and look for Media Center Extenders make sure the service is started automatic. If not double-click on it and click start. Do
 the same for the Network List Service, Quality Windows Audio Video Experience, UPNP Device Host and the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service. Also make sure the Internet Connection Service (ICS) is disabled.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Type in the windows search bar: Windows Firewall. Click on Allow a program through Windows Firewall. Now make sure the Media Center Extenders and Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service's Home/Private Check-boxes are checked and Public is unchecked.
 If this isn't so do this.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. If the Media Center Extender firewall rule is missing follow this <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/media-center/216821-windows-firewall-blocks-xbox-extender-win-7-ultimate-n-x64.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
guide</a> to add it in. If you do need to follow this <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/media-center/216821-windows-firewall-blocks-xbox-extender-win-7-ultimate-n-x64.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
guide</a> make sure to go back into "Allow a program through Windows Firewall" and uncheck public for both the Media Center Extenders and Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service check-boxes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Delete the Mcx User account located under <strong>C:\Users</strong> (This is the account that is corrupted that wmc creates also I am assuming you don't have any media center extenders already connected properly)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. Now in the My Computer file location bar type in <strong>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Appdata\Local\Microsoft</strong> and delete the
<strong>eHome</strong> folder. (I am also assuming you have no media center extenders connected properly)</p>

            <div>That is extremely odd. This condition should have been evident if you tried to</div>
<div>create another regular user which should have failed as well. I know you also</div>
<div>posted some of this in a thread where I asked someone to create a new user</div>
<div>profile as a fix for a similar issue (not the identical issue perhaps). Creating</div>
<div>a new user profile successfully would have identified an issue with the existing</div>
<div>user. Failure to create a new user profile would have possibly uncovered an</div>

            yes on my computer i did have a problem with the default user, the firewall problem was a symptom and also when i created a new user i couldn't log into it because i received an error. this is how i fixed my default user which inturn allowed me to add
 an extender... that being said i still haven't solved my video display issues or my music playing sometimes in slow motion problem.

<p>
</p><p>This worked perfect for my problem reconnecting 2 Xbox 360s that had suddenly lost connection with my Windows Media Center server.&nbsp; I've tried a couple different suggestions over the last week and none of them worked until I found this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I navigated to the Default User account I indeed was missing the ntuser.dat file.&nbsp; So, I followed all the instructions above and I was able to re-add my two Xbox 360 Extenders.&nbsp; One other thing I tired which may also have been an issue was when I opened
 the "Media Browser" (now "Emby") program that works as an add-on to WMC, it still showed the two Xboxes connected.&nbsp; So in the settings menu within "Emby," I deleted all of my Xbox's from the list of connected devices.&nbsp; Again, I don't know if that was preventing
 the re-adding of the extenders, but there is always a possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again so much for your help!&nbsp; This fix has saved me many more hours of frustration and from continually being yelled at by my wife because she can't watch the news in the morning.</p>

<p>I started up a repair request with someone over the Support Chat 2 weeks ago but haven't heard anything back yet.&nbsp; This is my fifth xbox 360 to get the red ring of death so the support member was requesting for a free repair and said that I would hear back
 within 72 hours.&nbsp; Well it's been just about 2 weeks and still nothing.&nbsp; Better yet, when I go to xbox support page and try to get in contact with anyone, I can't.&nbsp; All of the buttons at the bottom (Chat with ambassador, chat with support, request a call) are
 greyed out and I can't click on them.&nbsp; And yes I completed step 1 but still can't talk to anyone.&nbsp; Can someone please help me?</p>

<p>Your probably wasting your time anyway...</p>
<p>I can't even get the idiots at customer support to understand that MY 360 console did work fine (in it's original configuration), including playing all the old xbox games...until their secret, hidden, update (which i knew noting about until it's UGLY consequences
 revealed themselves) wiped my console and loaded the new rubbish...</p>
<p>They can't get it into their thick heads that THEY need to fix it as it was THEIR "update" that damaged it...</p>
<p>XBOX and their SUPPORT is a JOKE!</p>

</span>To answer your question directly, yes this is something that is experienced on other similar devices as well. We are currently looking into this and will have a response within the next week if there is a way to have your keyboard backlight setting saved
 after shutting down or restarting. </span></span></p>

</span>We have done some thorough investigating and there is no built in setting that allows the keyboard brightness to stay at a designated level. Whenever shutting down or restarting, this setting will revert to the default keyboard brightness.</span></span></p>

    <title>&#34;Dead&#34; Folder In Network Location Cannot Be Accessed or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diogenio  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Dead&#34; Folder In Network Location Cannot Be Accessed or Deleted</h2>
                    
<p>Under "Computer'" If I open my "Network" folder I can see my own location (let's call it "HUSBAND-PC") and my wife's wireless networked laptop (let's call it "WIFE-PC"). The network works perfectly in all respects -&nbsp;except for one very annoying issue.</p>
<p>In my own location is a file folder named "access." It's properties indicate it is a shared network folder, and its sharing permissions are exactly the same as all the other folders shared on the network. The first strange thing is when I right click the
 folder to show its properties - the "Security" tab that is present on all my other shared folders is not there. &nbsp;However, the other 4 tabs are present: "General, Network, Sharing, and Customize."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, if I try to access this folder, it fails and I get&nbsp;an error mesage that states: "<span>\\HUSBAND-PC\access</span>&nbsp; is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource,
 etc. &nbsp;Contact the administrator, etc. The device is not ready."</p>
<p>If I right click this folder and try to delete it, there is no "delete" command available to me.&nbsp; If I try to copy a file to it, I get an error message that states: "An error has occured. The destination you specified does not exist. It might be an offline
 network location or an empty CD or DVD drive. Check the location and try again."</p>
<p>I do not remember creating this folder, but recall that when I tried to migrate my old files over from a previous XP computer hard drive, I had terrible issues trying to open&nbsp;a transferred folder which was also named "access" on my old drive.&nbsp; I recall having
 to go through many steps to finally gain control of those files. Perhaps this "phantom" folder was&nbsp;somehow created at the time I was having permission issues with the XP hard drive?</p>
<p>Anyway, this folder is bothering me and I want to DELETE IT!!! It is causing no harm, but I hate to have a folder present that I have no use for, or any control over. I want my system to look and run clean. Can you offer instructions as to how I can eliminate
 this "phantom" folder?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Here's how to remove old network connectios in Vista (in fact, two ways): <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2056400_remove-old-network-connections-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ehow.com/how_2056400_remove-old-network-connections-windows.html</a>.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, go to Control Panel &gt; Classic View &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Customize &gt; Merge or delete network location &gt; Highlight the network then click Delete.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            The program suggested does NOT work either! Doesnt Microsoft hasve a method to unlock/erase this file, other than to use 3rd party solutions? After all...it is WINDOWS, a MS operating system that has the issue!&nbsp;

<p>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command Prompt and right click on command prompt and click on run as Administrator.</p>
<p>CD to the drive with the problem and then CD to the folder above the folder with the problem and type rmdir &lt;foldername&gt; and enter and see if that works.&nbsp; I doubt it will but is is an option we haven't tried so it's worth a shot.</p>
<p>I know of no other 3rd party programs that work better than Unlocker so if that doesn't work, I don't have any other options to try.</p>
<p>The only remaining option is to move everything else off the drive for safe keeping and then format the drive which will certainly erase the folder and then move everything back to the drive.&nbsp; I can think of no other solutions.&nbsp; This WILL work to fix the
 problem even if it is a bit of a bother and somewhat time-consuming.&nbsp; If you REALLY want it gone, this is the only remaining option to do it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>How do I stop Windows 10 from automatically opening browser for wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billhines  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Windows 10 from automatically opening browser for wifi authentication&#63;</h2>
                    When I'm at a hotel for example, and connect to their wifi, Windows 10 automatically opens my browser (Chrome) so I can login to their security proxy to get wifi access. I have my browser set to remember my last opened pages and tabs, and when this happens,
 every single one of my tabs goes to the hotel login screen. On some of them I can press the back arrow after I log in, but on others the pages are gone and I can't remember which ones I had open, so they're gone. Very frustrating. I'd prefer if Windows 10
 would just connect, remind me with the little popup that I need to log in, and then let ME open a different browser &nbsp;(firefox) to do that, then open my primary browser so I don't lose everything.&nbsp;

            The hotel login screen comes from the hotel's internet provider. It doesn't have anything to do with Microsoft and Microsoft can't prevent the connection.

            I understand that. I have no problem with the connection, in fact I select the hotel wifi network myself. It's what happens after that. With other versions of windows, I could then launch the browser on my own and go to a page (i.e. google.com) to force
 the hotel's login screen. What Windows 10 does is jump the gun and fire up the browser for me. I don't want that to happen. I'd rather start the browser myself, so I can pick the browser myself and not have all of my open tabs replaced by the hotel login page.

<p>Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I suggest you is to clear out all defaults for it and assign them to your preferred browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type "Default" to Search box.</p>
<p>Choose Default option with the checkmark icon.</p>
<p>Pick your new browser in the list and "set as default".</p>

            Thanks Yuri. That's helpful, but I'd still like a way to change the behavior rather than have to remember to do this every time (change the default browser, then change it back). It didn't used to work this way before Windows 10.

            Look into Chrome's Incognito settings. Also change Chrome's privacy settings to never open saved tabs or resume tabs. I have Chrome always to open a blank tab, not any previously open pages. Then I can open an Incognito window in chrome or just be selective
 about what to open.

            I generally have 26 pinned tabs, and then about ten or so open tabs for articles and pages that I need to read, for research purposes. So opening Chrome to a blank tab isn't going to work at all for me :-) &nbsp;That's the problem - with the current behavior,
 most of those tabs get wiped out, and I don't want to lose my place.

<p>I keep running into this as well. And the respondents aren't understanding the problem correctly.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't want to change my default browser. It's a waste of time.</li><li>I don't want to configure my browser to always open with a blank tab. Might be useful for some of you, but not for everyone</li><li>It is not a problem with Chrome, or even with the Hotel portal. It's a problem with Windows!</li><li>I DO NOT want Windows to auto-open a browser to sign-in to a public wifi hotspot, because that is the problem.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There does appear to be a way to stop this though. Set the following registry key to 0 (zero)</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet\EnableActiveProbing</p>

<h2>            Audio and Video Skipping on Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    I recently updated to Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge and&nbsp;it worked for a while but now all Microsoft software will not play audio or video.&nbsp;The &nbsp;Edge browser, Windows media player, xbox are all having the same problem with audio and video that skips.&nbsp;
 Edge web browser plays videos like a broken record with a lag about 6 or 7 seconds of skipping for one second of actual video. Chrome browser&nbsp;works fine and plays audio and video with no problem so&nbsp;it must be a bug with the Windows 10/ Edge update. Please,
 how do I fix this problem? Thank you.

<p>...Fehlercode E71 angezeigt ... wie lange meine Box noch am Leben bleibt?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Da der E71 Fehler scheinbar "nur" ein Updateproblem ist, ist es also Software bedingt, und Deine Konsole lebt eben so lange wie die Hardware keinen Defekt hat.</p>
<p>Falls die Tipps mit Platte neu einsetzen nichts helfen, versuche folgendes:</p>
<p>Mit Festplatte starten, dann unter "Meine Xbox" ganz nach rechts zu den Systemeinstellungen gehen. Dann "Speicher" whlen, und bei der Festplatte Y drcken.</p>
<p>Jetzt die Tastenkombination X, X, LB, RB, X, X drcken. Die Abfrage nach Wartung auf dem Speichergert besttigen und warten, bis die Konsole fertig ist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dann die Konsole ausschalten. Drcke und halte dann den Synchronisierungsbutton auf der Konsole. Bei der "alten" Xbox 360 ist es der kleine Button neben den Memory Unit Slots. Bei der Slim Konsole ist es der Knopf direkt neben
 der Klappe fr die USB Anschlsse. Halte diesen Knopf fest und schalte die Konsole am Hauptschalter ein (nicht ber den Controller). Halte den Sync Button gedrckt, bis das Dashboard komplett geladen ist.</p>
<p>Jetzt gehst Du zu den Systemeinstellungen, und machst einen Verbindungstest zu Xbox Live, um nach vorhandenen Updates zu prfen.

<h2>            Program files missing from C&#58;&#92;Program Files &#40;x86&#41;&#59; reinstall&#47;uninstall failure</h2>
                    I'm having some issues with a few of my programs having gone missing from my system (So far I've noticed two in particular, Steam and Star Wars: Force Unleashed, although there may be more that I've missed). The programs are not present in the Start Menu,
 and the program folders have disappeared completely from C:\Program Files (x86). Upon attempting to reinstall either, a popup saying that the program is already installed is created, and offers to launch the uninstall for said program. However, clicking on
 the uninstall option only closes the popup , cancelling the install, and does not initiate uninstall. Furthermore, neither program is listed in the Control Panel Programs and Features uninstall list, nor a third-party uninstall program's list. It's been awhile
 since I've used either, so I have no idea when the problem occurred; restoring to my earliest System Restore point had no success. I've attempted to run scans with Microsoft Security Essentials and Malwarebytes in case the problem is some form of malware,
 but to no avail. At this point I can neither install nor uninstall either program, leaving me stuck. I've exhausted my ideas; does anyone here have a solution?

<div>EDIT: I found a workable solution, and posted it below in case anyone else has the same problem.</div>

            I have tried the above-mentioned uninstaller, but it also does not show the programs in its program list. At this point I don't believe I have installed any third-party maintenance software.

            I figured out a solution, in case anyone else runs into this problem. I ended up searching regedit for all the registry keys tied to the programs and deleted them, and since the actual files are already gone, the program is effectively uninstalled. I am
 currently reinstalling the programs with no problems so far.

<p>A previous email from that same email address was confirmed by Microsoft to be

<p>Here are two easy ways to know if what you're seeing that claims to be from Microsoft is actually fake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flow is a legitimate Microsoft app, but do you actually use it? If you don't use Flow ...&nbsp;<em>ding dong</em> ... it's a fake notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you do use Flow, the rest of that notification could be fake. To find out, rest your mouse pointer on the 'Fix my flow' button.&nbsp;<em>Don't click on it.</em> When you rest your mouse pointer, a URL should pop up that shows you where your browser will
 go if you click. Is that a legitimate Microsoft address? If it isn't ...&nbsp;<em>ding dong</em>

            No never used it and still have no clue what it is. But try holding your mouse on my message #1 to see the hot link you will be taken to and tell me if that is an authentic Microsoft link...it is too long and cryptic for me to make any conclusion.

<h2>            DETAILED - Feature requests and list of issues - video streaming, start menu and touchscreen functionality</h2>
                    <p>I have the latest Windows 10 Pro updates (from Aug 12).&nbsp; I have a Sony VAIO Pro 13 Ultrabook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SPECIFICATIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Intel Core i7-4500U CPU @1.80 GHz 2.39 GHz</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics 4400 (latest) (<em>Driver date</em>: <strong>7/17/2015</strong>,
<em>Driver version</em>: <strong>10.18.15.4256</strong>).&nbsp; <em>Latest event</em>:
<strong>Driver Management concluded the process to install driver igdlh64.inf_amd64_7345e650fb5910de\igdlh64.inf for Device Instance ID PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_0A16&amp;SUBSYS_90B6104D&amp;REV_09\3&amp;11583659&amp;0&amp;10 with the following status: 0x0.</strong></p>
<p>Audio: Realtek High Definition Audio (latest) (<em>Driver date: </em><strong>7/9/2015</strong>,
<em>Driver version</em>: <strong>10.0.10240.16384</strong>)</p>
<p>Touchscreen 1080P display - 10 point multi-touch display</p>
<p>Disk drive: Samsung MZHPU256HCGL-00000 (256 GB PCIe SSD)</p>
<p>Anti-virus: Kaspersky Lab Internet Security 15.0.2.361(c).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ISSUES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue&nbsp;1 - </strong><strong>Start Menu</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to pin all my Office 2013 desktop apps to Start Menu.&nbsp; I was able to pin Access 2013.&nbsp; Right after, when I tried to pin Word 2013 and Excel 2013, they did not show up on the Start menu.&nbsp; Now, when I try to unpin Access 2013 from the Start menu,
 nothing happens.&nbsp; Please see screenshot below - Access 2013 is pinned and the menu says
<em>Pin to Start.</em> Also, Word and Excel are not pinned.&nbsp; A reboot fixes this issue, but only temporarily.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6690a634-b467-48fe-990d-8adef4414c48" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue 2 - Video Streaming:</strong></p>
<p>I have Edge, Firefox 40, latest Chrome and latest Opera installed.&nbsp; All except Edge&nbsp;have Ad Block Plus plugin installed.&nbsp; When I go to any web site (YouTube, CNN, ESPN, or any site that has Flash video - Porsche, Infiniti, etc.) to watch videos, below is
 how the video appears in all browsers except Chrome.&nbsp; However, the audio stutters in all and the video skips a lot in all browsers.&nbsp; Disabling the Ab Block Plus plugin does not change anything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: The Netflix desktop app displays the video and plays the audio perfectly fine (perhaps because they are not using Flash any more)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also, the fact that the video runs fine in Netflix desktop app and Chrome browser tells me it is not the display driver or the audio driver issue but Flash is not running fine in Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/134cef75-1ef0-458a-bf42-339cff98ed75" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73f1314f-afdb-4806-9d07-5a0a2faa308a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue&nbsp;3 - </strong><strong>Touchscreen:</strong></p>
<p>When I first updated to Windows 10, the touchscreen was working fine.&nbsp; I was able to pinch to zoom, scroll around and click links&nbsp;on the touchscreen.&nbsp; There was a Windows update related to the touchscreen -
<strong>eGalaxTouch USB Touchscreen Controller A108</strong> on August 5 (along with a cumulative update).&nbsp; After installing that update, the touchscreen no longer works properly.&nbsp; I can only click on it.&nbsp; I can no longer zoom in/out and scroll using it.&nbsp; Moreover,
 the update does not show up in the Windows Update list for me to uninstall.&nbsp; It does show up in the Windows Update History page.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa4c2cc9-490f-47f3-a61b-7617ca296f94" /></p>
<p>When I click on Uninstall Windows Updates (Installed Updates in Control Panel), this eGalaxTouch update is not listed.&nbsp; So I am stuck with this update and a less useful touchscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue 4 - Opening certain programs and files takes a lot longer than before</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Access 2013&nbsp;database file - it has 4 small tables, the largest table has around 6300 records.&nbsp; In Windows 8.1, Access 2013 would start up very quickly and also load up all 6300 records within 3 seconds.&nbsp; In Windows 10, Access takes a while longer
 to start up and it takes a LOT longer to load the 6300 records.&nbsp; I feel as though I am scrolling through a database with millions of records.&nbsp; That is how slow it is.&nbsp; Please note in the specifications above that I have a PCIe SSD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>FEATURE REQUESTS:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Request 1 - System Login Screen background image:</strong></p>
<p>Please allow us to change this image.&nbsp; We were able to in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Request 2 - Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>When there are a lot of updates available, you have to scroll down the list (you do not even notice the scrollbar till you move the mouse over the list).&nbsp; I do not understand why the list of updates can't fill up the entire Windows Update
 screen.&nbsp; Also, it would be nice to display links to the KB articles in the update info.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would also be nice to show&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;updates available and the total download size the way it was in Windows 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Have you changed to an older style theme such as 'Windows Classic' or a High Contrast? This will cause this by design.</p>
<p>If so, just try selecting another theme.</p>

    <title>Intel Quick Sync enabling problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fairy dish washer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Quick Sync enabling problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i've been waiting patiently, but nothing is happening from Microsoft side for ages now regarding mess they've made.</p>
<p>After one of the Windows 10 updates "Screen Resolution" option with old settings were removed or well hidden from Display section, therefore there is no way for users like me to enable Intel GPU on virtual monitor which allowed to use Intel Quick Sync.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm attaching pictures of how it used to be:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c69689f9-f062-46f3-9cfc-f813fcda3621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c69689f9-f062-46f3-9cfc-f813fcda3621" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>So if there is a soul out there that knows how to do it on current Windows 10 version and willing to share it, please, save this poor man from slow computing power and give him Intel Quick Syn! Thank YOU!</p>

            <p>Intel directs to seek help in this place, so it's kinda a circle now. I assume downgrading to Windows 7 is the only solution then as it doesn't seem to get fixed ever. Anyway, thank you for your effort.</p>

    <title>Requires Two Taps for One Click in Certain Programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newtspork  say:</h3>
<h2>            Requires Two Taps for One Click in Certain Programs</h2>
                    <p>In many programs (mainly games), in order to click something with the touch screen, you need to tap twice. If I understand it correctly, it seems that, I tap somewhere, which sort of sets the location of the cursor, then tapping again anywhere results in
 the <em>previously tapped</em> location to be clicked. That second click also sets the cursors new location. This makes it nearly impossible to do anything. One such example of a program that does this is osu, as indicated&nbsp;<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/606154/tablet-pc-requires-double-tap-for-single-click-in-some-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>osu has a special Tablet PC mode that stops this, but I don't actually play osu. The games I play don't have this option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I was wondering if there was a way to turn the taps into actual clicks like if it was just a mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info will help. Even just some info on how I can go about writing a program to map the inputs in something like C# or maybe even AutoHotKey.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am experiencing the same problem, which unfortunately makes it impossible to play many touch screen games that work on windows 8.1 like cut the rope or Luxor.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to find a good solution for this, but gestureworks gameplay may do the trick for some games. However it doesn't work perfectly in all games, mostly due to a little input lag.</p>
<p>Maybe you could try that and see if it works for you. Nevertheless, I would be very glad if Microsoft investigated this issue and patched it somehow, as one of the nicest things of the Surface pro is gaming on it.</p>
<p>

                    <p>Have read the previous answers but still can't print. I get a message "save as'. I have run trouble shooter and also run the diagnostics which say that I have the correct driver. ( Just downloaded from HP)</p>
<p>The system recognizes my HP Office jet 6500 (connected by wire) to my HP Desk top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other thing; I did have my desk top de- compromised (is that a word?) by a repair professional but can't remember if that was before or after installing Windows 10. Everything else works fine although I prefer Windows 7.( I'm Old). Do I have to purchase
 that new office program or something?</p>
<p>If all else fails I'll have to load both units into my car and go back to the shop.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><font><font><span>Has any third party
</span><b>cl<span></span>anup utility</b><span> or </span>
