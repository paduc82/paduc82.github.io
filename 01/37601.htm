<h2>            Skype for Business&#58; Conference Calls</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up many meetings daily and recently I have run into a problem with my dial in information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people call my number, the auto message says that the 'leader of this meeting has restricted access to this call, please announce yourself or wait for the leader to admit you to the meeting', as far as I know, I have not changed any settings on my Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can fix this? I need people to be able to dial in, enter the conference ID number and just be admitted to the meeting. There are cases when I do not have access to my PC to 'admit' people into my calls, so it's just not an option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one else run into this issue? It's a very recent change, I have been using Skype for Business for nearly two years and ran into this problem only last week.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know and thank you for any information you can provide!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Elizabeth DiRaimondo</p>

    <title>Share System Sound Not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seridath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Share System Sound Not working.</h2>
                    <p>I posted about this a few months ago and am still have the issue after a few suggestions by support failed and heard back no reply from them since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I used the share system sound quite regularly with friends to stream games and other such and it was great! only service that makes it easy without hassling with third party apps or letting the audience hear themselves echo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For for several months since buying a Wireless Headset. (Razer Man 'O War Wireless) the Share System Sound option doesn't work at all. when i click the option it will close the menu and when trying to open again the option will not have changed and will
 remain inactive, those in the call unable to hear any sound other than my mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this with my old wired headset and it worked fine so maybe there is some clash between the wireless drivers and the share system sound? But its been like this for a few months and this is the one feature I need to get working, the only thing
 your competitors like discord doesn't have yet.</p>

<p>
</p><p>All the fixes in here i have attempted and have not fixed the system. im happy to try anything else or even talk to live chat support but that didn't seem active for technical issues.</p>

<p><span>Most likely the wireless headset is not compatible for Skype app use.

            It does seem like something between razer wireless and skype. The weird thing about this is that i can use the headset with skype perfectly besides the system sound share option. I am talking on skype now with it and can hear friends and they hear me perfectly.the
 system sound share is the only issue.

<h2>            Xbox One Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I bought RDR2 for 50 euros from this site : [removed link]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I played for 3 hours today, now my xbox is not starting anymore, after the green xbox logo I can see the screen for like 2 seconds and then it goes black and that's it. I have a feeling I got banned which is completely unjust since I bought the game for
 the full price and my xbox isn't working at all. I just looked in the library online and RDR2 wasn't featured.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>please try the manual power cycle steps like mentioned on the following link, be sure to wait at least 60 seconds before powering on again:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>if you were banned it would most likely show a message regarding it, so no need to worry about that at the moment.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that there are currently issues with downloading purchased content which I assume could be the cause why you are not seeing the game in your library. For the latest details see:

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see
<br />
if that helps. Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal
<br />
manner? Heat related&nbsp;does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible <br />
that something is too sensitive&nbsp;to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when <br />
possible) -&nbsp;actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust <br />
bunnies and clean&nbsp;the&nbsp;vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening <br />
the case). If a laptop about all&nbsp;you can do is reseat the memory and clean the <br />
vents (still can try adding a small fan as a&nbsp;test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need <br />
the help&nbsp;of a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service)&nbsp;or the <br />
System Maker's&nbsp;Support.<br />

</strong>This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though

it is&nbsp; "possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all
<br />
cards, memory&nbsp;and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not <br />

a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy&nbsp; or other BigBox stores) <br />

<br />
Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor <br />

<h2>            Problems with corner navigation and start button on desktop winows 8.1</h2>
                    The corner navigation on the top right corner or top left corner doesn't show up anymore but sliding my finger from the right side of the mouse pad brings up the charms. I read on another post to press ctrl+c&nbsp; but nothing happened. The start button on
 the desktop isn't working either I have even tried to right click it but nothing happens (the windows key on the keyboard still works)

<p>Try&nbsp;to boot your computer in safe mode and then check the status. Safe mode, start Windows in a limited state where only essential programs are started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the steps provided&nbsp;below to boot your computer in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trick is to hold the Shift button and mash the F8 key, this will <em>sometimes</em> boot you into the new advanced ‚Äúrecovery mode‚Äù,&nbsp; where you can choose to see advanced repair options.</p>

</p>
<p>You will need to click on the Troubleshoot option.</p>

<p>Now select Advanced Options.</p>

<p>Now choose the Windows Startup Settings option, by the looks of things we were never meant to find Safe Mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x381ximage34.png.pagespeed.ic.J3Dk0QcKYa.png" height="381" width="650" /></p>
<p>Finally hit the Restart button.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x347ximage35.png.pagespeed.ic.r7Sf0hLCRJ.png" height="347" width="650" /></p>
<p>Like magic, when your PC reboots you will be able to boot into Safe Mode from the familiar looking Advanced Boot Options screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f624x480ximage38.png.pagespeed.ic.ITlffbJuSl.png" height="480" width="624" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong>clean boot</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue persist try to </span><span>check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run

<p>Hi SverreRakkenes,</p>
<p>The answer is yes. It is a limitation. Since the photo of Skype for Business is synced from exchange, Skype for Business plan 2 users don‚Äôt have exchange features. Therefore, they cannot get photo form exchange. Given the situation, would you mind submitting
<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273497-skype-for-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">feedback</a> to our related team about this feature? Many features have been designed or upgraded based on our customers‚Äô valuable comments.</p>

<h3> mighty joe  say:</h3>
<h2>            ERROR - processor does not support Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a system that has a&nbsp;Pentium D 2.8 GHz that is currently running Windows 8.0 and which is totally compliant with Windows 8.0/8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When I click on download Win 8.1 I get an error that states that my processor does not support Windows. This is incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exact wording of the message is: Sorry, you can't install the update because it's not supported by your CPU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pentium D 2.8 GHz+ supports PAE, SSE2, and NX and all</p>
<p>have been verified as present/active by MSs Coreinfo.exe tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'More Info' link on the error page lists these 3 CPU extensions</p>
<p>as requirements for running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my CPU supports them, why am I blocked from upgrading?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please give me a work around.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to this article and make sure that your computer satisfies all the hardware requirements mentioned there to install Windows 8.1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 8 .1 system requirements</a></span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>If the computer has all the mentioned requirements, then either of those components may be turned off or may not be working properly on the computer. You may also refer to this article:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-is-pae-nx-sse2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What are PAE, NX, and SSE2?</a></span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also contact the computer manufacturer to test the hardware components and check if they are working properly. Moreover, please make sure that you have installed all the updates for the Windows 8 operating system
 via Windows Updates and also update the drivers for all the devices on the computer to their latest version before you start with the Windows 8.1 installation and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For additional information, please refer to the document provided within this article:</span></p>

            <p>Mighty Joe says that he(and I am having the same issue) are already running Windows 8 and the processor installed is compatible. There is something else going on here. I am not happy as I purchased Win8 and should be entitled to Win 8.1 as well. The RT version
 install&nbsp;was screwed up and I think there is a problem with the Win8.1 download/install, too.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue on my HP xw6200 workstation. &nbsp;It is currently running Win8 64bit that I purchased back in January.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The system has Dual Xeon 3.6GHz processors (nacona family), 8Gb RAM and a 250Gb SATA drive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After looking at the Windows 8.1 system requirements page, I see that there are 3 additional items that a processor needs to support for 64bit Win8.1:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>CMPXCHG16b - supported by my cpu<br />
PrefetchW - not supported by my cpu <br />
LAHF/SAH - not supported by my cpu </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So the processor requirements have changed which I hardly think is reasonable when no mention of this was made (that I can find) when Win8 was purchased! &nbsp;So I am stuck at Win8 64bit with no path forward. &nbsp;I am not downgrading to 32bit I the work I do on
 this system is greatly helped by having the 8Gb available.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Windows 8.1 adds some features needing additional processor requirements which are not in Windows 8 and the Pentium D was&nbsp;manufactured without these options.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why 8.1 is classified as an upgrade rather than an update, distinct from previous versions of Windows where even service packs were distributed via Windows Update. There have been in the past examples of such upgrades have been offered but
 charged for (Windows 3.11, Windows Server 2008 R2) and that caused just as much upset because they were not free.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There has been a upgrade path throughout the entire life of Windows and at various stages individual processors have dropped out of compatibility as the demands of the O/S changes. It is obviously debatable if this is appropriate for a&nbsp; point release but
 as far as the kernel is concerned so were Vista (.0)to 7(.1) and 7 to 8(.2) as well as 8.0 to 8.1(.3) so in reality these are all the same level of upgrade we just have one for free (not a common experience from Microsoft)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My XP based Pentium D laptop will now got to 7 as 8.1 is not an option and I do not like 8 (the jury is still out on 8.1)</p>

            I suppose I am just gutted that after living with the slow downs in XP/Vista on this machine I was just so happy with the new found responsiveness i was getting with Windows 8. &nbsp;Given the point release details in your post, I hope they will support Windows
 8 as separate to Windows 8.1, just as they continue to support Windows 7.

            I don't get it either...They have been talking about this rollout forever and they just failed to mention that they were adding features that would screw some 8.0 users ?? I am sure they could have a tailored download for these poor creatures that have
 such&nbsp;Ancient ??&nbsp;processors. I am also baffled by the phrase..if you installed 8.0 with no problems, you probably will be able to install 8.1. Is that misleading or what. BTW..if you decided to revert back to 32 bit, that would entail formatting and installing
 drivers for that system ?? Oy vey...I'll put up with 8 until I can find a cheap copy of 7. And we should get a credit for what we spent on 8.0 ?? Thanks for all the helpful info.. Have a great day..

            <p>I wouldn't disagree with you but the Windows 8 options are disappearing fast. There was such a backlash against Windows 8 that in part led to 8.1 being pushed out I suspect Windows 8 is considered as being a mistake that Microsoft would be quite pleased
 to bury completely. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Alarm bell do ring when you consider what 8.1 is classified as even though it is free and it is a full dot level upgrade which in programming hierarchy is no small thing. Did they accelerate and amend the work which was already in the pipeline for the next
 release? Had somebody realised 8&nbsp;had the potential to be a lemon even before it came out?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft has the tendency to keep information close to it's chest. It has had it fingers burnt before so have worked out a tight need to know strategy. Right or wrong who knows but that is what we work with.</p>

            <p>CoreInfo is essentially a dump of the specific CPU capabilities. If the BIOS of the computer does not give access to any of these function the report may not show the limitations. Windows compatability check will be testing access from the operating system.
 There wouldn't be much point in doing the test if the current O/S can block the check.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to create clips from long video in Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    Hi, I have a long video (one hour) which I need to split into separate clips, to add individually to slides in PowerPoint. But I cant see (despite hours of YouTube and the help in MovieMaker) on how to do it.&nbsp; I can see how to split videos and trim them,
 but what I need to do is cut this long video into clips and be able to save each one with a different file name. I am using Windows 7 with Office 2010 and Windows 8 / 2013. Some Help files refer to editing lables I do not see showing in the versions I am using.&nbsp;
 Thanks.&nbsp; David

            <p>Just for reference, here's some instructional articles on splitting video and trimming video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to SPLIT a movie in half or in to multiple parts, you can do this...</p>
<p>I have illustrated that here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://bit.ly/NoacAK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/NoacAK</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to TRIM and Delete sections of video...<br />
In Windows Live Movie Maker select the movie clip you want to edit by double-clicking on it. Then use the edit TOOLS at the top [ribbon].</p>
<p>I illustrate this here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://bit.ly/Noatnj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/Noatnj</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it turns out, if you're trying to cut the video into chunks and then possibly right-click on the chunk/clip to save it, Windows Movie Maker doesn't have that function. You have to cut out the specific section,and nothing else, that you want to keep and
 then export it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Movie Maker 2012 has the native ability to export videos to WMV and MP4. Choose the MENU option on the top-right, use the option for SAVE MOVIE, Choose your export choice [High definition, DVD, Movie, Email, etc.], and then when asked where to save
 the file [file type], you have the option to choose between <strong>WMV</strong> and
<strong>MP4</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later,<br />
Larry<br />

            <p>Thanks so much Larry, I will try it tomorrow.&nbsp; I hve spent hours upon hours trying to resolve this. Microsoft seems to take two leaps forwards and four backwards!&nbsp; All the video clips on You Tube etc that I have seen, show how to do it, as you say (right
 click and copy / paste / save etc, as with all other programmes and versions), just not the more modern ones! It just makes life so difficult trying to learn new skills when older versions were easier than newer ones, when one would think they should be getting
 better!&nbsp; Sorry for the moan and thanks for your helps.&nbsp; I'll try it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<h2>            How to create a script to edit Local Security Policy -&#62; Local Policies -&#62; Security Options</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to create either a powershell script or batch file to change Security Options in Local Security Policy? I am running Windows 8.1 currently but do often switch between Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 so posting a way to create a script on at least
 one of these platforms would help.</p>

<h2>            My screen images &#40;pictures &#38; text&#41; have gone grey &#40;no colour&#41;. How to restore colour&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, my monitor screen lost all colour and <strong>I am stuck with shades of grey (including text). And this includes this Community page.</strong></p>
<p>Checking Device Manager says my graphics card is working OK and I have the latest driver.</p>
<p>So what could be causing the problem?</p>
<p>Pretty dull working in a grey world.</p>
<p>A response would be much appreciated.</p>

<br />If above doesn't work
<br />
<br />The BSOD issue, in general, is caused by graphics driver particularly nVidia drivers.
<br />
<br />Option 1 - Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Go down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices

<br />Click Let my pick from a list of device drivers on my computer
<br />Choose the driver
<br />Click Next to update
<br />If this does not work, select Search automatically for the updated driver in place of Browse my computer for driver software
<br />Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Option 3: Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the display adapter's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer
<br />See if some driver is released for your model and OS
<br />If yes, download that
<br />In Option 2, you click Update Driver Software, in place of this, click Uninstall
<br />Install the downloaded driver

            Hi Edsa, try this Screen Filter keyboard shortcut: 
<br />
<br />Window + Ctrl + C
<br />
<br />What caused this is you probably pressed the Windows Key while pressing Ctrl + C when copying something . . .

    <title>Re-registering my PC in MS Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carol13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-registering my PC in MS Account</h2>
                    <p>Assuming that I could re-register it with ease, I mistakenly&nbsp;removed my primary computer as a Device in my MS Account.&nbsp; Nope, wrong move.&nbsp; My initial motive was to rename the computer, but editing does not allow that.&nbsp; I know there is an answer floating
 around out there, but I cannot seem to snag it.&nbsp; Please help.</p>

            <p>I have done that several times with no result.&nbsp; Neither "hunt for a device" nor "manually&nbsp;register one" works for&nbsp;my PC.&nbsp; The only offers are phone, tablet, Xbox, and Surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not do a couple of suggested other removals pointed out in&nbsp;some answers.&nbsp; Maybe I should have.&nbsp; Can you direct me to those instructions in one way or another?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My secondary computer (laptop)&nbsp;still shows the primary (aio) in my MS Account.&nbsp; Does that make sense? I wanted to change Bean to Inga because I ended up with two Beans naming my devices.</p>

            <p>There is no such things as "hunt for a device" or "manually register" on Microsoft devices. &nbsp;If you see options like that, you might be on a scam website and I advise you to stop using it it because it is fake and not real.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to add a device is from your own computer directly, not from a webpage. &nbsp;To add a computer to the list, you must go to your computer's SETTINGS app, then the ACCOUNT section. &nbsp;It cannot be done on any website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. There is no such thing as a "primary device".</p>

            <p>Hi, 'Cmdr,'</p>
<p>I am sorry that my quotation marks were misleading.&nbsp; I actually meant them to mean using my own words and not quoting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jumping from my machine to an MS account online through Settings puts me on&nbsp;a kind-of home page with me correctly as Administrator and still in Settings.&nbsp; I can "Manage my MS account" or "Add an MS account." The first one puts me on an online&nbsp;page listing
 basic info and purchases and devices.&nbsp; Which is where I wrongly removed my aio device, Bean.&nbsp; The second choice puts me on a similar Settings's page, but which offers the options "Manage my MS account,"&nbsp;"Sign in with a local account," or "Add an MS account."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either situation I can then go to Devices and see my phone and my laptop; but not, of course, the Bean/Inga aio.&nbsp; It is here that I run into&nbsp;the "Check for others" and "Add more devices." And I can't get my computer relisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whew! That is the long way 'round.&nbsp; I hope I made some sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A note:&nbsp; I simply&nbsp;choose to&nbsp;list the aio as primary.&nbsp; I use the laptop as secondary and backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hm-m-m, I seem to be Carol13 again.&nbsp; Thanks for reminding me.</p>

            <p>I know this screen and agree with carol13. I have run the "Sign in with Microsoft account instead" screen maybe 50 times and it WILL NOT WORK... My account is OK in general, I can logon to it from a browser, FROM THE SAME DESKTOP,&nbsp;and see my phone and laptop
 BUT I can NOT add my desktop from the account WEBSITE which they DO offer for phone, surface, Xbox, and Band BUT NOT PC&nbsp;by the way. By the way ALSO my desktop was the 1st thing on the account. I have also RESET the PC 3 times and this has NOT helped. I heard
 something about being BLOCKED but HOW do you CHECK on that and if you are HOW do you get UNBLOCKED? By the way I would call my DESKTOP my PRIMARY DEVICE, that is over the phone and laptop it has NOTHING to do Microsoft account just the way I consider MY EQUIPMENT
 that's what Carol13 meant.. So how do we fix this???????????</p>

<p>If you use "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead" to create a local account, you will never see that PC show up on the website.&nbsp; Ever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to make a PC show up on the site, is to login to the PC using a Microsoft Account</p>
<p>It's the same for phone. The only way to make a phone show up on the site, is to login to the phone using a Microsoft Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only devices that have been signed-in using a Microsoft Account can show on that website, that's the only way. You can never "add" anything&nbsp;from the website. It only shows a nice list of everything you added on the devices directly themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's fine that you consider your desktop your primary device, but you can't use it with Microsoft Account features if you're using a "local account" on the computer.</p>

<p>Thanks for the&nbsp;backup.&nbsp; I have been away from this question because of two and one-half operations. (I am not going to explain that, but I am walking and reviving.) Will be back to join the fray again.&nbsp; By the way, Amazon managed the name transition with
 only a little disorientation.</p>

                    I go to sign in to LIVE and it prompts me to enter email and password. Once I enter the email, what I assume is the password screen is just white blankness with my avatar and current time above. Any advice on how to fix this?

<h2>            Keyboard randomly sticks keys</h2>
                    I have an ASUS laptop. The keyboard works fine and the keys aren't actually sticking but on occasion, particularly the 4 key and the alt key would act like they are held down. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the keyboard driver, I've plugged
 in an external keyboard and it does the same thing. I have even gone as far as to reset everything to factory defaults and the problem still arises. Does anyone know how to resolve this? I've searched multiple sites and can't get a clear answer other than
 to reinstall the keyboard driver which I've already done.

            Installation time can vary depending on a number of factors such as your data set, processor speed and memory. Installation time can take from 2 to 20 hours depending on those factors mentioned.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cancel the installation, rollback to your previous installation of Windows and do the following:<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.<br />
<br />
Also, run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, it will scan your system and provide a report telling you if your PC can run Windows 7 and if there are any known compatibility issues with your programs or hardware.<br />
<br />

Also:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />

    <title>Potential memory leak&#63; Invisible ram usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zsolus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Potential memory leak&#63; Invisible ram usage</h2>
                    So, I had purchased Windows 8.1 pro which ran beautifully on my computer for two years with virtually no issues whatsoever. I upgraded to Windows 10 since the free upgrade sounded enticing. Maybe about a week after upgrading and not having any issues i
 decided to delete the image for windows 8 since it took up about 30 gigs on my ssd and that's a decent chunk of memory for back up files alone on my relatively small ssd. No more than a couple days later i'm running into an issue where windows is just taxing
 my ram for literally no known reason whatsoever. Nothing shows up in the task manager. &nbsp;It's almost like it has lost the ability to stop using ram that it has already used at one point so it just moves to unused memory until there is non left and my pc begins
 to lag terribly. I'm posting this here because i've yet to find any solution although i've visited countless other threads with relatively similar issues and im losing hope. Does anybody have any suggestions or know a way to roll back to windows 8 without
 having to completely format your hard drive if you've already removed the backup from upgrading? Thanks for the help.<br />

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-system/how-to-what-are-my-options-for-obtaining-windows-7/528163c1-0b2e-4ad2-a26d-7112851d1dc2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to: What are my options

            <p>Why do you want to go to 64bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main advantage to switch to 64bit is the ability to access more that 4GB ram due to an increased address range. In practice 32bit can only use approximately 3.2GB for technical reasons but 64bit requires a minimum of 2GB RAM as opposed to 1GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strictly speaking the license is for only one version of Windows as supplied with the computer, OEM packs only came with one disk which had to be specified whereas retail packs came with both.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information. I should have been clear though, the windows is installed on a macbook pro with bootcamp, not preinstalled. My friend cant find any of the packaging. Is the product key the one viewable when I click on properties of my pc next
 to the genuine windows logo and computer specs?</p>

</p><p>"<em>the product key the one viewable when I click on properties of my pc</em>" - No, it's the one on the Certificate of authenticity and nowhere else [a
<em>Product ID</em> is not the same thing as a <em>Product key</em>].&nbsp; However, there might be tools that can examine the computer to retrieve that key - I know nothing about Bootcamp so I do not know what can run on it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours was a straightforward Windows computer into which a product key had been entered manually [rather than preinstalled] then I'd suggest running
<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Belarc</a>.&nbsp; Belarc&nbsp;will retrieve a whole lot of info that includes product keys for the OS &amp; applications.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>But please note that Belarc does not know its own limitations and would retrieve a completely useless product key from preinstalled Windows without telling you&nbsp;and it might also do the same for some applications [all I can vouch for is that on the half
 a dozen computers I have tried it on it has retrieved the correct product key for MS Office].</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>I really think you need to make a list of the applications you intend to install &amp; the applications you might install.&nbsp; Then go to their websites and find out if they have both 32 &amp; 64 bit versions.&nbsp; I have never seen an application that has a 64 bit version
 but not a 32 bit version [but I have seen lots&nbsp;that have 32 bit versions&nbsp;but not&nbsp;64 bit versions].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest that you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">confirm</span> the computer's RAM capabilities before messing around reinstalling Windows not after - if your "old" computer turns out not being able to take more than 4GB RAM then you
 will have wasted all your efforts installing 64 bit Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also need to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">confirm</span>&nbsp;that the computer is capable of running 64 bit Windows.&nbsp; I imagine that you would need to check both the computer's specs and any limitations introduced by its version of Bootcamp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>64 bit applications&nbsp;only operate&nbsp;if the whole chain is there - </p>
<p>
</p><p>64 bit CPU</p>
<p><em>64 bit Apple OS?</em></p>
<p><em>64 bit Bootcamp?</em></p>
<p>64 bit Windows OS</p>
<p>64 bit Windows application</p>

            <p>To reiterate Try*3 almost all programs are both 32bit and 64bit, the very few exceptions are specialist applications particularly scientific. Again all 32bit programs should work exactly the same as the 64bit, there is no "better" other than 64bit can be
 marginally faster. When Office 2010 came out Microsoft was recommending install the 32bit version unless there was a specific need, otherwise avoid 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you need to verify the max RAM capabilities of your particular MacBook Pro at what cost then consider how you are going to use it. More memory means more concurrent programs, is that how you tend to work?.</p>

                    I have a Windows7 Laptop. And for some reason when I try to connect to the Wireless Internet, it says connected, but has no internet connection. Then the message: "Windows can't communicate with the device or resource (primary DNS Server)" appeared. I
 have no clue what it means. The internet only works when I have it hard wired, but it is very inconvenient that I can't use &nbsp;the wifi.

<h2>            how do i create a still photo from a video&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In moviemaker, I was able to take a snapshot of a video clip that I'd like to use in a print publication. &nbsp;How do I access the .png file or save it as a .jpg or whatever I need to do to save the image apart from the video project?</p>

<div>Windows Live Movie Maker has the option of grabbing a screenshot during the previewing of your video.</div>
<div>Play the video in Windows Live Movie Maker, and during the preview [on the HOME tab] you'll see the option for Snapshot.</div>
<div>You click on Snapshot and then the application will capture the current video position and then ask you to save the Snapshot as a PNG file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are no other options to export, other than PNG.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The PNG file can be saved anywhere on your system [like your desktop].</div>

    <title>Dynamic Workspaces in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nousoul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamic Workspaces in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to Windows 10. I last used Windows XP in about 2005. I used OS X until about 2011, and have used Ubuntu since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so far quite pleased with Windows 10, though I am missing a few features from the Gnome shell. The feature I most miss is dynamic workspaces. Is there any way to replicate this in Windows 10? Is there any chance that future updates will allow for dynamic
 workspaces?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Rearranging may be another issue, at least I have never needed to do that.
<br />
<br />You can send a Window to a different virtual desktop.
