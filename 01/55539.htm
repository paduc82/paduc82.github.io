<h2>            Windows 10 networking issue</h2>
                    My friend has update his Toshiba Satelite P75-A7100 to run windows 10 but can no long turn off airplane mode. when I go to network options and select airplane mode i cannot toggle it off and there is nothing listed under network devices. I checked in the
 device manager and the computer does list the network adapters and neither are showing the (!) and state they are working properly in their properties. However when I go into network and settings and click to change adapter settings it says the folder is empty
 and the basic information panel list a number of items as not available such which is odd since one of them is the processor. I tried running netcfg in the command prompt but most just result in an error code 0x800106d9. I tried to go into regedit and manipulate
 the radioenable from 1 to 0 and when that didn't work I switvhed it back just to be safe. At this point I am completely lost. Nothing seems to work and none of the fixes I have found so far are helping. Does anyone have an

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device drivers may have been impacted by the update that was installed. It will be helpful if we gather more information using the troubleshooters in Control Panel. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>On the left panel, click on <strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Network Adapter</strong> and allow the troubleshooter to run.</li><li>Do the same for <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the tools are unable to find and correct the issues, you can manually choose the driver for the network adapters. Refer to
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">
this guide</a> by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> to use earlier versions of device drivers in Windows. Using a compatible version of the drivers will allow the adapters on the computer to function the way they did before updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you are able to connect the computer to the network after trying the suggestions.</p>

<p>Rob:</p>
<p>I think at this point we may have reached the end of the issue and I will leave it to you to call it, if there is nothing else we can do. For those who might read this thread I will recap:</p>
<p>I had an issue where I was trying to print documents through a network from a Win 7 Ultimate 32bit laptop to a XP laptop connected to an HP PSC2210 All-In-One Printer. Neither multiple page documents nor single page documents would print more than one page.</p>
<p>Rob’s suggestion to change the XP’s printer driver to not spool, (Print Direct to printer) allowed multi page documents to print fine. However single page documents could not print multiple “Copies”.</p>
<p>Checking with HP for new drivers found that they no longer have supportable drivers created to specifically handle the PSC 2210 in Win 7 like it did when it was created with the older version of Windows Hp recommends the use of the current driver supplied
 with Windows 7 to do the jobs with work-around’s for scanning and printing with no other support for ink levels or networking beyond that.</p>
<p>Win 7 does set up a Virtual USB Port for the network printer in the “Printer Properties” selection, which incidentaly is a little confusing in Win 7. There is the natural “Properties” at the bottom of the selection screen as there has been in all other versions
 of Windows, but this does not have the same information as was expected. If you look upward on the same selection screen you will see “Printer Properties”, which in fact, is the properties you expected to see when looking at the bottom one.</p>
<p>Most of the information on the “Printer Properties” is grayed out so you can not change it. I have checked it and by default, all I can see is correct.</p>
<p>Now one last Gotha!</p>
<p>I printed to my wife’s PSC 1500 printer: same network same target XP, (the wife’s); both printer properties, on her pc, for both printers, with the exception of the spooling change, are the same; will allow me to print more than one copy of a single page
 document. What a pain in the…</p>
<p>Guess I print to her printer with requests for multiple copies. LOL. HMMMM? Use her ink??? I wonder how much trouble I will get into with that practice?</p>

<p>We get quite a few requests for old games like these on the forum, alas, this is unlikely for a couple of reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; This is a very old game.&nbsp; Path of Neo was released in 2005 - thirteen years ago.&nbsp; Why would this be an issue I hear you cry?</p>
<p>Well, it's based on the now rather old Matrix Film license.&nbsp; When developers/publishers make games based off a movie license, said license is only held by the developer/publisher for a finite amount of time.&nbsp; The amount of time depends on the deal made with
 the movie studio.&nbsp; This license has now likely expired, probably over a decade ago.&nbsp; It's not possible to get the PC version of the game as a download, so the chances of this game coming to Xbox is probably zero.&nbsp; Plus, the game may also include licensed music
 track, which have probably also expired a long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Microsoft were only ever planning to bring a select few original Xbox games to the Xbox One.&nbsp; This is down to a combination of licensing issues, plus the amount of time and resources it takes to repackage these old games for the Xbox One Platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgive me, my intention here is not to slam down your request.&nbsp; It's just an FYI on how complicated it is to bring back old games with complicated licensing agreements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The legitimate play this now is either on an original Xbox console or a PC - assuming your PC still has a DVD drive, many new computers lack these now.</p>

<h2>            1 USB&#47;Removable Drive Appears Double in Windows Explorer&#47;My Computer Navigation</h2>
                    <p>Okay so i wanna ask something about the USB drive in Windows 10.</p>
<p>I'm using Alienware 15 laptop. As soon as i updated to Windows 10, i create a factory backup using a 32GB usb drive (via AlienRespawn). The usb drive then became a bootable disk drive (FAT32) at that time. Then after i save the files onto another media,
 i decided to format the usb back to NTFS. So i format it via windows explorer to NTFS and it seemed to work, where i can use it as usual. But i noticed something that bothers me. When i plug in the usb, it appears double in win explorer (one showed up inside
 My Computer tree and another showed up outside/same level as My Computer) just like the picture below. Drive I: (HILDE_32) appears not only inside My Computer tree but also outside, while another removable disk like F: appears normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6090bc19-5720-445f-9e8b-fdc843de5818" /><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried remapping the drive letter and converting the usb from active to inactive from Disk Management. I also uninstall the usb's driver from usb hardware properties and reinstall it but nothing seems to work. So the question,
<strong>how to remove the drive outside of My Computer tree in Windows Explorer and how is it there?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>*FYI: It also appears double on another pc, and the drive's icon on Disk Management is a bit different to another removable drive:</p>

<p>Thanks in advance~!<br />

</p><p>This might have caused due to any driver or missing/corrupted System related issues. I suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
Run the System File Checker scan (SFC) and check if it helps. This scan will help you find and replace missing or corrupted System Files.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try installing the latest chipset drivers from manufacturer's website and other updates from Windows Update and check if it helps.</p>

    <title>Halo 2 Vista &#8216;invalid product key&#8217; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr guru117  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo 2 Vista &#8216;invalid product key&#8217;</h2>
                    <p><span>Good evening,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before I start my asking for help and rant I realize that this is an old game and support has ceased. I have a brand new (was sealed) copy of Halo 2 for Vista (so the key hasn’t hit its 5 use max). I have installed the Games for Windows Live
 version 3.5 on my Windows 10 machine. I installed the game on my machine by enabling compatibility mode to Vista SP 2 on the Halo 2 installer which ran without a hitch. When I was prompted to activate the game now or later during the install I selected later.
 I then ran the game exe also in Vista SP 2 compatibility mode. After that I proceeded to type in my Windows Live/Xbox Live credentials then typed in the product key then proceeded to attempt to sign in. That, like so many others on this forum and others, ran
 into the infamous ‘Can’t sign in because your product key is not valid. Please enter a valid product key.” Here are the troubleshooting steps I have taken.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Completely removed Halo 2 and GFLW files, folders, and registry keys then reinstalled each to receive the same message.</span></li><li><span>Tried to install the copy of Halo 2 on another one of my machines which I had freshly installed Windows 10. The result is the same.</span></li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With all this said, Microsoft, Microsoft Games, or 343 I ask that you create a solution to fix this as there are still customers still buying this game off amazon, eBay, and the like who are running into this problem and are very
 frustrated as I am. I paid good money for this game and seek to play it and get my campaign achievements! All that I am asking for is a viable solution to this very frustrating problem.</span></p>

            While that could be, there are reports of users goong back to ‘08-‘10 with these same issues. Could be that because there are GFWL key gens out there that that is why the keys are ‘not valid. I aill reach out to xbox live support and see what, if anything,
 they can do.

<p>I'm a fairly technically savvy person, but this is out of my league and I desperately need the help of someone with more experience. &nbsp;I can't connect to xbox live and it is driving me insane! Any and all help is very much appreciated. Thank you, God Bless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in?&nbsp;</strong></span>United States/Arizona</p>

</p>
<p><b>Network Connection Type: </b>Wired<b><br />

<strong>Things you have tried: </strong>All of the xbox recommendations. Although I was not able to connect my xbox directly to the modem. Played around with the DMZ, enabled it for my xbox IP address.&nbsp;<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is UPnP Enabled? </strong>Unknown<br />
</p>

<p><strong>When you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" what is the exact message shown on screen?&nbsp;</strong>Your console can connect to xbox live, but your router or gateway isn't properly responding to ICMP responses. It gets to the very

<p>Yes I have tried the steps in that guide. My house is fairly old and I don't have the capability to plug the xbox into the router, and have a TV all in the same room. One thing to note...yesterday I turned off my comp that is running on the same network
 and saw improvement, but still wasn't able to stay connected to Xbox live. Don't know if this helps. All I know is that I'm terribly frustrated and haven't been able to play online for 3 days now. The game I'm trying to play is NCAA football 12</p>

<p>Were you able to connect previously? If so, has anything changed in your home or network setup? If it hasn't, you may want to call your ISP, to be sure that nothing has changed on their end in the last 3 days, either.

<p>Yes I was able to connect previously, and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has changed. I'm able to connect to xbox live now, but as soon as I try to play my game or use netflix it disconnects me. This has probably been one of the most frustrating things ive ever experienced.
 I call xbox for support, and after two hours of them not figuring out what the problem is, they say they cannot help me because I'm using adapters to connect to xbox live and that I need to contact my ISP. (which is discrimination in my mind, because of the
 way my house is structured this is the ONLY way I can connect) So I contact my ISP today and after two hours on the phone with them, they say that they cannot help me, everything is good on their end. No one on here has a clue as to what is going on either.
 I google search ICMP response error and I get nothing helpful. If this continues I will no longer be an xbox live customer, and immediately seek a refund for my membership.</p>

<p>EDG! Thanks you for understanding. I do appreciate your help. I have an ethernet cable running from my router (Actiontec PK5000) to my adapter (TII Network Technologies TURBO 85) that is plugged into an electrical outlet in my computer room. I have another
 adapter plugged into an electrical outlet in the living room, which is connected by ethernet cable to my xbox. Any and all advice will be very much appreciated. THANK YOU!</p>

<p>You can't expect something like powerline adapters to reliably carry data, especially for a system like XBL which has much higher standards than normal web browsing. &nbsp;Power lines were never designed to carry data, and especially if you're living in an older
 house, even the slightest fluctuation in power is going to throw off whatever signal the powerlines are carrying. &nbsp;You either need to plug directly into your actiontec or get a wireless adapter and connect wirelessly.</p>

<p>I suggest updating the firmware of your Actiontec Router. &nbsp;From what I have found it seems your model struggled to properly handle ICMP. &nbsp;Updating the firmware to the current release may solve your problem. &nbsp;If it does not, maybe a different brand of router
 would help but I hate to see people spend money on guesses.</p>

<p>I'm having similar troubles. I can't figure it out either. I've tried almost everything but a complete reboot of my router. I don't recall having this kind of trouble until after the last Xbox update. I'm wondering if that may have anything to do with it.
 It's driving me nuts. I haven't been able to play in a good 4-5 days, at least, I'd say. You're right. There is no help with regards to this when you Google it. Once I find a solution I will post it on here for you. I've tried altering my network settings.
 Manually searching for my network. Since about half the time now it won't even appear on the list to choose from. Despite that my Xbox hasn't been moved from where it's at in several months and my PS3 is right next to it as well as my laptop and both of those
 have no problem with my network. I'm utterly baffled by this one this time.</p>

 used to have these problems until a couple months ago. I wonder if it's something on Xbox's side that is causing this to happen to us? I am glad to hear that I'm not the only one experiencing these same problems.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Update Error KB 967912</h2>
                    
<p>I have an update which has repeatedly failed. The update for Windows Live Sign In Assistant fails every time it tries to install. One help article said that my firewall may be stopping it, but as I use the windows firewall that came with my Acer laptop,
 this shouldn't be the case.<br />
The error code is KB 967912, does anyone know what's causing the update to fail?<br />
Many thanks,</p>

            Hi CitySleuth,<br />
Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers forum.<br />
<br />
Can you please post back with the error message that you receive when trying to install the update.&nbsp; KB967912 is the name of the update.<br />
<br />
A workaround for this issue is uninstalling any MSN "stuff", the reinstalling using the latest version, which includes this update.<br />

<h2>            Not able to play music and videos</h2>
                    Installed ccomodo firewall on my laptop few days back. But for some reason it started freezing and restarting with BSOD with the error message 'watchdog_violation'. So did a system restore to a earlier restore point and everything seemed to be normal but
 for some reason I am not able to play any of the music and the videos in the metro xbox music and video app. I am getting the error as seen in the screenshot.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64ef0dd5-e5cb-4d8c-8af1-86ef79a1c653" />

    <title>active widows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kazimhtrack  say:</h3>
<h2>            active widows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded windows 7 to windows 10 with free offer.</p>
<p>Everything was ok, windows 10 activated.</p>
<p>Then I decided to make a clean install of windows 10 because windows 7 was installed long time ago and had a lot of unwanted software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted form USB and decided to merge few partitions as well, I had separate partition for all my data.</p>
<p>First shock was when I deleted system partition and&nbsp;tried to make a new one... windows setup said that I have MBR table and I must have GPT to continue...
</p>
<p>I found that if use legacy&nbsp;boot form USB&nbsp;I can install windows 10 on MBR, so I created new partition successfully and installed windows 10, at least all my data save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But&nbsp;after this&nbsp;I can not activate windows&nbsp;10 for second day.</p>
<p>Error code: 0xC004C003</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read on other old topics (Windows 7) that it means that windows key is blocked...</p>
<p>What I have to do now? ...wait few more days?&nbsp;call Activation center?</p>
<p>I still have my OEM partition and I may try to restore Windows 7 and upgrade to windows 10 again... will it help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.</p>
<p>I've just&nbsp;found another post with same error... my current windows key ended with&nbsp;"JTB3W" as well.</p>
<p>But I upgraded my windows 7 to windows 10 first, then waited when&nbsp;windows 10 activate, then waited almost 24h to make shure that activation was stored somewhere and made clean install of Windows 10, now I have this error....</p>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What it means and how to fix it</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are a few reasons why you might see this error:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You performed a clean installation of Windows&nbsp;10 instead of first upgrading from your previous version of Windows. When this happens, we aren't able to register your entitlement with the activation servers because you aren't upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10. To fix
 this, you'll need to go back to your previous version of Windows, make sure the previous version is activated, and then upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10. For more info about how to go back to a previous version of Windows, see the section in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery options in Windows 10</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You upgraded to Windows&nbsp;10, but the activation servers were busy. If you upgraded from an activated copy of Windows&nbsp;7 or Windows&nbsp;8.1, your copy of Windows&nbsp;10 will be automatically activated, or you can wait a while and then select Activate now. If you performed
 a clean installation instead of first upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10, see the info on how to fix this problem in the previous item.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You might also see this error if you're using an invalid product key. For example, you can't use a Windows&nbsp;7 or&nbsp; Windows&nbsp;8.1 product key to activate Windows&nbsp;10.</p>

    <title>Asus Taichi screen on lid not working -- backlight off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaredclaypoole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus Taichi screen on lid not working -- backlight off</h2>
                    <p>My Asus Taichi works fine in laptop mode, using the inside screen. &nbsp;It also works fine if I boot onto the tablet screen on the lid. &nbsp;However, if I switch from the inside screen to the tablet screen, the screen is blank. &nbsp;Upon further inspection, I realized
 the problem is that the backlight is turned off. &nbsp;I.e., if I shine a flashlight on the screen, I can make out some text, images, and whatnot on the screen -- it's just not lit up in a way that can be seen easily. &nbsp;Putting the machine to sleep and waking it
 up doesn't help. &nbsp;It seems the only way to turn on the lid's backlight is to restart and boot into tablet mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem which began in the past two days. &nbsp;I suspect it might be a consequence of the recent Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I request two things as a solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I would like to know whether it's possible to restart the backlight manually, preferably from a script.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;I would obviously like to find a fix which makes the problem resolve itself without case-by-case intervention.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is the issue, may be in your video driver and Using BIOS. Both drivers are older. So, you will need to update both the driver immediately to resolve this issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link for download video drivers,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversForWin8/VGA/VGA_Intel_Taichi_Win7_64_Win8_64_Z917102857.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversForWin8/VGA/VGA_Intel_Taichi_Win7_64_Win8_64_Z917102857.zip</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and another one BIOS actually i don't know the link. you have to find that driver in your laptop brand website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once, you updated both of the above. Try to install again the operating system. After that only this issue will fix.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I've had a similar issue with State of Decay 2. Windows 10 suddenly didn't recognize a RAID5 disc set that I had a gaming directory on and believe that is where I told it to install the game which I had been playing for 2 weeks. Lost the connection to the
 RAID (even though it was functional and all three drives were there) so had to reimage and restore. My icon on the taskbar is blank that use to point to the game, going to MS Store it doesn't give me the option to re-install as it says "The Product is installed",
 it never appeared in the programs and features area and for the life of me it's never been found installed on the main O/S drive. At least with Steam games I can reinstall but this microsoft store process sucks. Might have to wait until I finish my new Windows
 10 system where it doesn't see anything at all and re-install it then. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So frustrating.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Run the SFC command when troubleshooting a buggy Windows system. SFC works by scanning for and replacing system files that are corrupt, missing, or changed. Even if the SFC command doesn’t repair any files, running it will at least confirm that no system files are corrupted and then you can continue to troubleshoot your system with other methods. You can use the SFC command as long as the computer itself will start. If Windows will start normally, you can run it from an administrative command prompt. If Windows won’t start normally, you can try starting it in Safe Mode or in the recovery environment by booting from your installation media or recovery disc.

<br />
<br />Would you be so kind to say if this solved the problem?

</p><p>Would you explain to me why the option to send a short message to cellphone contacts via Skype has ceased to function? &nbsp; This has been a very helpful function for my long distance contacts where there is a large time difference. &nbsp; If I had known that the
 new version would not support this function, I would not have upgraded our account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this function has not been altered, then could someone explain what I need to do to enable this function on our account. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I totally understand the importance for you to be able to send an SMS to your contacts through Skype, however, this option is currently unavailable in the new Skype for Windows desktop, Mac and Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But do not worry, this has been noted and I'll forward it our engineers as a feedback. For the meantime, you can install the classic version to continue sending SMS to your contacts. To install the Skype classic version, refer to the steps below:</p>
