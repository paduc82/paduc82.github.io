    <title>Surface Pro 4 Type cover not detected after tablet mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Type cover not detected after tablet mode</h2>
                    <p>I have had the device for over a year. Sometime in the last month or so the Type Cover began to malfunction like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If connected and open when the device is switched on, then the Type Cover works fine until the cover is closed or folded under/behind the device.</p>
<p>- When the device is opened or unfolded with the device in Tablet Mode the Type Cover is not detected and the device stays in Tablet Mode even with the keyboard connected. The light on the Fn key stays off. The Cover is not shown in the keyboards list in
 Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Removing and reattaching the Type Cover</p>
<p>- Cleaning the connections on the device and the type cover with gauze</p>
<p>- Updating the device</p>
<p>- Updating the Type Cover driver</p>
<p>- 2 button shutdown</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of my troubleshooting works. As it stands, the only way I can get the Type Cover to work once closed or folded back is to shut down the computer and start it again with the cover attached and open. Then it only works until it is closed or folded back
 again, whereupon it stops working until the computer is shut down and restarted again. When it is working it works flawlessly.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's none of our intention for this to happen and definitely this is not the experience we want for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to ask some questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your capslock will lit?</li><li>Did you tried connect your type cover to another Surface device? </li></ul>
<p>If you tried connecting to other device and the type cover is not working as well, please contact
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Support</a>&nbsp;for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi. Thanks for taking an interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The caps lock light, the Fn key light and the keyboard backlight all work when the type cover is working after a start-up, but stop working once the keyboard is folded away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have access to another device to try swapping the type cover, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll happily take this up with support if that's what you advise.</p>

<p>I discovered while poking around in Device Manager that the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover Integration device Properties dialog shows the most recent event as "Device not migrated", with the following information. Does anyone know what this might mean?</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Device HID\VID_045E&amp;PID_07E8&amp;Col04\6&amp;302348a5&amp;0&amp;0003 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 start menu disappearing and Settings error</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 start menu and setting not working. Start menu opens, appears to be blank, and then disappears. The settings app gives the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Runtime Error! Program: C:\WINDOWS\ImmersiveControlPanel\SystemSettings.exe This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more information.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>afterwards another error pops up saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an associaton in the Default Programs control panel.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even use the Default Programs option because i have to go through settings in order to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've scavenged youtube and forums for this problem and have tried so many different options. I've tried troubleshooting, powershell, (using the command:&nbsp;"&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(89, 89, 89, 1)">Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage
 -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}<strong> ")</strong></span></p>
<p>I've tried 'msconfig' and the safeboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>****Post moved by the moderator to the appropriate forum category.****</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>None of the above seemed to work so any other suggestions and tips would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Julie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no doubt that i have corrupted system files. It's possible that i may have made changes but i don't recall when or where.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately both the <strong>System File Checker</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>DISM</strong> failed. But i appreciate your suggestion.</p>
<p>The system file checker was 34% through the verification when it stopped and said "Windows &nbsp;Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DISM was 5% through when it stopped and said "Error 1392, The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other suggestions, again, they would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>Windows Vista magnifier off, but zoom function is still - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brazilian girl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista magnifier off, but zoom function is still on&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
This is driving me absolutely nuts. I have gone to control panel, ease of access, optimize visual display, and the box for "turn on magnifier" is NOT checked, meaning that I was supposed to not have the font changed every 2 min while I am browsing the web...&nbsp;
 I have tried everything more than once, and nothing works. PLEASE HELP, THIS IS MAKING ME SO FRUSTRATED!!!<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check your Mouse and Keyboards as they might have ZOOM active. Especially the upper right button<br />
on an Optical Mouse. I just changed the ZOOM the to Disabled on mine.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Mouse&nbsp; - change the button from ZOOM to another setting or Disabled.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Keyboards if needed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />If you mean the DotNet Framework, the no, that costs nothing, Windows will generally contain a number of versions of that Framework.
<br />
<br />Are you receiving an error with regards to the DotNet Framework, if so, please provide more information on that and possible a screenshot of any error(s) you are seeing . . .

<p>In a drastic move following the marred launch of Assassin's Creed Unity, Ubisoft has "discontinued" the game's Season Pass and announced free offerings as compensation to owners of the game.</p>
<p>In a separate Q&amp;A, the company confirmed that the Season Passes "has been discontinued". As a result, current Season Pass holders on all platforms will be gifted a free Ubisoft game of their choice from the following list:</p>
<p>The Crew</p>
<p>Far Cry 4</p>
<p>Watch Dogs</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Black Flag</p>

<p>Looks like Windows XP is the last version of Windows they supported.&nbsp; Unless Mustek releases newer drivers, you're probably not going to get this device working in Windows 7.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Like Richard pointed out, It was compatible with Windows XP. The manufacturer is yet to write MUSTEK Scanexpress 1200 UB Scanner drivers for Windows 7. Click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=MUSTEK%20ScanExpress%201200%20UB%20Scanner&amp;v=MUSTEK&amp;uid=&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=3&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Scanners&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
 to verify.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, you could try <a href="http://www.mustek.com/mustek/supportdrivers.php?&amp;show=drivers&amp;disp_cat=Scanner&amp;disp_sr=USB%20Port&amp;disp_mod=1200%20UB&amp;disp_catid=18&amp;disp_srid=31&amp;disp_modid=114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>100&#37; disk usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragorobot  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; disk usage</h2>
                    <p>So i used to be able to play league of legends with about 90-100 ping, for those who don`t knwo what that means, it means nearly no lag. But ever since i upgraded to windows 8.1 every time I play League now I will randomly lag, so i went to task manager
 to see if i was running a high disk usage program, and I saw that League was taking 90-95 % of the disk and that that was causing the lag. Now i know that cannot be right since i barely ever lagged before, ive even tried setting my quotas to my ram and all
 the other popular solutions, but it still lags and even while doing simple things like opening google chrome ONCE about 7-8 google programs pop up and sometimes when league is not open an app called wsappx(2) will take up about 90-98% of the disk and sometimes
 even system takes up that much too, so can someone please give me a solution?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One controller on Surface RT</h2>
                    
<p>My searching has given me no info, maybe that's got more to do with my searching than anything, but will my Xbox One controller work with my Surface RT if i plug it in? I keep meaning to actually test it myself, but life, or actual Xbox One games always
 get in the way.</p>

<p>I got around to trying it last night, it's a no go, just shows up as an unsupported controller. I also tried my 360 controller plugged in with the play and charge cable, it was recognized, but didn't do anything.</p>

<p>For the Xbox One controller to work on Windows RT there has to be a driver made for it. At the moment, I don't believe there is so you can't use an Xbox One controller.<br />
<br />
As for your Xbox 360 controller, it's wireless. &nbsp;It will remain wireless even if you use the play and charge. &nbsp;Unlike the Xbox One controller, the 360 wireless controller can't be made wired by using a play and charge. &nbsp;If you want to use an Xbox 360 controller
 on a Surface RT, it needs to be a wired one.</p>

<h3> tyulip von zeiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Qualcom Atheros AR956x Adapter periodically disconnects, even are completely resetting my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Lately my laptop has been having an issue with the latest Windows 10 update. I have a&nbsp;Qualcom Atheros AR956x Adapter for a Lenovo Laptop with an AMD A6. Since a recent Windows 10 update, my laptop will suddenly disconnect from the internet with the dull
 WiFi signal. When I attempt to connect to ANY sort of router or gateway, it takes a couple of minutes to attempt a connection, then the WiFi symbol turns into the computer with the red X symbol for a second, pulling the menu back up and saying that the connection
 failed. I have tried diagnosing the Network Adapter but the tool says it cannot pick up any issues. I have attempted restarting my laptop, but after a couple of hours, it does it again. I've reset my router, I've updated my drivers, and I've even gone as far
 as completely resetting my laptop. I still have the issue and I don't know what to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi niche,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers forums!</span></p>
<p><span>Do you recall the change which triggered this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Sounds like the computer is infected with virus or the user profile might have gone corrupt.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Boot the computer in safe mode with networking</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To use a Safe Boot option, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple
 operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears. </span></p>
<p><span>b. Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p><span>c. When the Boot menu appears again, and the words
<strong>"Safe Mode with networking"</strong> appear at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to work without any issue in safe mode then you can infer that some third party software is causing the issue</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Put the computer in clean boot (to figure out if any third party software is hindering the process)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>----&gt; How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span>Perform a clean boot (check step 1 in the link); if everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third
 party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if
 you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span>
 - remember to put the computer back to normal startup follow step 7 in the link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Check with another user profile
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you do not have another user account, you will have to create one.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If everything works fine with another user profile, you can infer that the user profile is corrupt, check the link to know how to fix this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Fix a corrupted user profile</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Run an online scan for any threat and try to fix them</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-Us/center/cleanup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-Us/center/cleanup.htm</a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Regarding the error message
<strong>“<span>Microsoft Feeds Synchronization has stopped working.”
</span></strong><span>This is related to internet explorer</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to reset internet explorer, you have a
<strong>fix it</strong> in the reset internet explorer link below just click on it, to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to reset Internet Explorer settings</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;<span>When
 you reset Internet Explorer settings, all add-ons, stored passwords within IE&nbsp;and customizations are deleted, and you basically start with a fresh version of Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>

    <title>Streaming Game to PC while watching TV at the same time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i_am_a_pc_and_i_am_a_mac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Streaming Game to PC while watching TV at the same time</h2>
                    
<p>I pass my cable box through my xbox to watch tv. &nbsp;I've noticed that if I want to stream a game to my PC that is in another room, I can't have the live tv app running and play the game on my PC at the same time. &nbsp;Is there a way to do this that I haven't figured
 out? &nbsp;I figured that with the "snap" feature on xbox one that this console would have the ability to do that, not to mention most smartphones can run 2 apps at once.</p>
<p>My workaround would be to install an HDMI switch that runs the cable box directly to the tv, however, that deletes the purpose of the xbox one mission statement to be the one and only box for your entertainment needs.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Mac version 8.10.0.4 is not searching my Mac Address book.</h2>
                    MacBook Pro running OSX High Sierra 10.13.1. New Skype cannot/will not search my Mac Address book. There is no 'Sync Contacts' option below my profile picture. I've confirmed System Preferences&gt;Security and Privacy&gt;Privacy Tab&gt;Skype is checked. I've ripped
 Skype out and reloaded it at least 5 times. The names appearing in my blocked list are correct and limited. I've only about 10 of my normal contacts showing up in the 'Skype' contacts subset. Please advise.&nbsp;

            <p>I ran the repair as I was responding to you....&nbsp;it took a few minutes and it said it finished the repair successfully. I didn't see any difference, but didn't have any issues in the first place.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows Mail for my charter mail, Hotmail, and Gmail...&nbsp; the folders and mail are still there.&nbsp;And Photo Gallery shows all my folders and files.</p>
<p>

            <p>I installed Windows Essentials 2012. After that, a popup says newer version of Windows Live Mail is available, so I downloaded that.

<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that may fix my problems. If not, I will run the repair.</p>

<p>I think the problem is solved by the Rollback of the driver (TP-LINK Technologies) to Feb 2015.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t update to Windows 10 from Windows 7&#58; install gets stuck on boot</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to install the Windows 10 update without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried via Windows Update, the Media Creation Tool and by manually downloading the ISO and running from a USB. I get the same result with all of them - it seems to work until the computer reboots, then it gets to the blue Windows 10 logo. There's no
 loading bar or anything, and my hard drive activity light is off. At this point nothing more happens, so I have to do a hard reset. When it restores Windows 7, I get this error message:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've updated all my drivers, updated the bios, and enabled UEFI boot. Even booting from the USB causes the install to freeze at the logo!&nbsp;</p>

            That message indicates a problem with your NT File System (NTFS) and those kinds of problems can happen after a power interruption, plug pulling, using the power button, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown, etc.&nbsp; Have any of those events occurred?<br />
<br />
All that boring text on the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) page is mostly just boilerplate from XP and is the same (or close to the same) for just about all BSODs.&nbsp; Interesting to read one time in your life, but generally boring and unhelpful and the best information
 for troubleshooting a BSOD is in the STOP message and the line or two that sometimes comes under it.<br />
<br />
It is <i>extremely </i>unlikely that you need to disable BIOS memory options or any of that stuff you read on the BSOD, so I would not start there.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What you <i>need </i>to do for that error is run a check disk with error correction to see if it will straighten out the file system - and you may need to run it more than once.<br />
<br />
If you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD, you might get it to work from there but since most people don't or are not sure what they have, you can make a bootable Hiren's CD and run your chkdsk with error correction from there.&nbsp; The Hiren's Boot CD
 is also a good weapon to add to your troubleshooting arsenal.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
<br />
<br />
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp;
 Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>

    <title>Folder icons have invisible thumbnails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Folder icons have invisible thumbnails</h2>
                    Recently I noticed that my folder icons weren't displaying correctly. On closer inspection I found that the thumbnail previews that appear on folder icons such as video and pictures are not longer appearing and instead only the outline of them appears.
 The actual thumbnails themselves still display fine once I've navigated into the folder but the folder icon itself only displays a shadow instead of the multiple thumbnails it used to display. I've tried changing folder options and deleting the thumbnail cache
 but have had no success.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few methods which you can follow to resolve the issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to perform Disk Cleanup, cleaning up your temporary internet files, thumbnail, cookies and temp files, so as to check the thumbnail view of the photo is updated by cleaning up your temporary data.<br />
<br />
a. Click on Start, type Disk Cleanup in to the Search box and then press Enter.<br />
<br />
b. Check "Thumbnails" and then click OK.<br />
<br />
c. Click "Delete Files" button.<br />
<br />
Refer the link for more information:</div>
<div>Delete files using Disk Cleanup</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup</a></div>
<div>Note: It removes temporary files, empties the Recycle Bin, and removes a variety of system files and other items that you no longer need.
<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>Check if the issue persists in clean boot.</div>
<div>Refer:</div>
<div>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" under
<em>more information </em>to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>Microsoft Safety Scanner</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></div>
<div>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this resolves the issue. If issue persists, you can write to us and we will be glad to assist you further.</div>

            As I said previously I had already attempted to clear the thumbnail cache and temporary files through both a disc cleanup and through a third party application (CCleaner). Neither of which made any difference. I attempted a safe mode bootup and used microsoft
 safety scanner as suggested but these also made no difference. Finally I attempted a system restore to revert to a date before this problem first occurred but this again had no effect and I haven't made any recent changes to my system that I am aware of that
 would have caused this. <br />
<br />
Originally it was only limited to certain folders while some remained unaffected but as of yesterday any folder that contains media files or documents has an icon that appears as if it is trying to display the thumbnail preview but is unable to render the images
 correctly.<br />

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>Sorry to know that methods suggested earlier did not help.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This might be an issue with the registry settings on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note: <em>Please associate the file type accordingly as the steps mentioned here&nbsp;are for&nbsp;.mov files.</em></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Important: <em>Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications
 of these settings are at your own risk.</em></div>
<div><br />
Steps:</div>
<br />
1. Click Start and type regedit in Start Search.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Right click on: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mov\shellex\<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Backup the registry by following the steps from the link: Back up the registry:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072bc">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</font></a><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. Now delete “HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mov\shellex\” KEY<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. Open notepad and paste the following commands.<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mov\shellex]<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mov\shellex\{3D1975AF-0FC3-463d-8965-4DC6B5A840F4}]<br />
<br />
@=""<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mov\shellex\{BB2E617C-0920-11d1-9A0B-00C04FC2D6C1}]<br />
<br />
@="{c5a40261-cd64-4ccf-84cb-c394da41d590}"<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mov\shellex\{E357FCCD-A995-4576-B01F-234630154E96}]<br />
<br />
@="{9DBD2C50-62AD-11D0-B806-00C04FD706EC}"<br />
<br />
<div>6. Save it under whatevername.reg (make sure to use "all file" kind of type file.)<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>7. Double click on the reg file you just saved, it will reinstall the shellex inside the .mov key here: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mov with the right keys and stuff.<br />

            Okay before I got a chance to attempt the registry changes you suggested the problem seems to have resolved itself. I entered my music folder and found that the folders in there were unaffected and after that going back to the previously affected folders,
 removing their files and then moving them back fixed the problem. I had attempted this before but it didn't work. I have no idea what changed that made this process work on the second attempt. It was also solved by creating a new folder and moving the files
 from an affected folder to the new one. I don't know if there was some underlying registry issue that resolved itself naturally or not but thanks for your advice and if the problem reoccurs and doesn't resolve itself I will attempt the registry fixes you suggested.<br />

            Well the fix ended up not lasting too long. Not long after I posted the previous message the same problem occurred again. I attempted the registry fixes you previously suggested but the affected folders contain multiple file types so even changing the
 registry keys for all the file types contained within a particular folder didn't help.<br />
<br />
I did find however that it only affects folders that have recently been altered in some way. When I moved one file regardless of origin or length of time it had already been on my computer into a folder that was unaffected this would cause it to become affected
 by the glitch. <br />
<br />
On top of that when I ran a registry cleaning program that cleared the thumbnail cache this proceeded to affect all remaining folders that normally display thumbnail previews so it seems that any alteration to files contained within any folder causes this display
 glitch. <br />
<br />
I did also attempt using the previous version of one folder which fixed the issue temporarily but as soon as I moved a file back into it the thumbnail previews disappeared again.<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business Voicemail Icon missing</h2>
                    <p><span>Can someone help me with Skype for Business, on Windows 7 platform please?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The user had Office 2013 installed so, I uninstalled and tried installing 2016 (from the 365 site), in the hope this would fix the problem, but it hasn’t.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The user cannot see the Voicemail icon, which is located in the dial-pad tab – about 2/3 of the way down.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(I assume this is a standard feature for a user who has a SfB license, or is it?)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have followed the suggestions given on other sites, such as:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sign out</span></p>
<p><span>Delete cached user info</span></p>
<p><span>Sign back in, etc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately, nothing seems to work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is there something in the registry that needs to change?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Will deleting the cached folders/files work?<span>&nbsp; </span>Please can you help.&nbsp; (Note that the Voicemail option was ticked in the account portal.)</span></p>

<p>Hello Barton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here.</p>

<p>For better understand it, may I know if the Voicemail icon appeared before in the Skype for Business client with his/her Office 365 for Business account?

<p>If so, you can try to clear the Skype cached folders to reset the Skype for Business client and check this issue:</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Rudy</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First of all, thanks very much for you insightful help, which is very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Unfortunately, the solutions you suggested were tried and did not resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Interestingly, the problem affects half a dozen users in one of our remote sites, as they have exactly the same issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am very green to much of this setup, Office 365, etc., and so please forebear my ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I am not currently able to provide much of the information requested; however, what I can say is that when the Skype for Business client is started, a red exclamation mark appears on
 the Conversations Icon, for approximately 50 seconds.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>A related icon also appears in the very bottom-right of the SfB box.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If you pass your mouse over or click the icons, there is a message that says something about the Exchange server being unavailable.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>My Boss says that everything is in the Cloud, so we shouldn’t be getting this error, which he says actually refers to Exchange Web Services (EWS).</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again…</span></p>

<p>Hi Rudy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help and feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, my manager has decided to take this problem through another route, which does not involve me so, providing screenshots, etc., was totally out of the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can say however, is that I don't know for sure if the voicemail icon existed before the problem was raised with me.&nbsp; According to my manager, the issue is not the license and there is continual reference to Exchange Web Services (EWS) so, the solution

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you running MSE or other antivirus/security programs that stop Windows Defender from running?<br />
If so then Windows Defender is blocked from running by them. McAfee, AVG, and many others do this.<br />
MSE includes Windows Defender's functions in it so that running it separately would be redundant.<br />

Maybe something here&nbsp;if needed :<br />
<br />
What is showing/causing the error message? Some security/anitvirus/antispyware products can<br />
cause this error. Which of those do you use INCLUDING any that your ever had even those<br />
uninstalled (the remnants can cause issues). McAfee is just an example of what many can do.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box - Services - find at top of list - Right Click - Run as Admin<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - set to STARTED and AUTOMATIC<br />
<br />
or set to STOPPED and MANUAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if needed<br />
