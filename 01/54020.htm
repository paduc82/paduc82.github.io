    <title>What&#39;s the best monitor to utilise Xbox One X&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j3t jupit3r  say:</h3>
<h2>            What&#39;s the best monitor to utilise Xbox One X&#39;s capabilities&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was looking for a new monitor that I might buy alongside the Xbox One X, in hopes of ultilising the 4k capabilities that it offers. I came across two reasoonably priced models, AOC U2879VF and&nbsp;Samsung U28D590D. Would these two be suitable? or are there better monitors for the xbox one x around the&nbsp;$400-600 range?</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One X</a> is able to support&nbsp;<strong>"AMD&nbsp;Free-Sync"</strong>, which is an adaptive refresh rate&nbsp;to reduce screen tearing. The AOC&nbsp;monitor has that going for it, while the&nbsp;Samsung monitor <em>doesn't </em>support Free&nbsp;Sync.&nbsp;That's one thing to keep in mind between your choices.</p><p><br /></p><p>For the kind of money you're spending ($400-600), you could very well get a decently large&nbsp;4K&nbsp;TV&nbsp;<strong>with HDR.&nbsp;</strong>Even if either of your monitors&nbsp;are&nbsp;10-bit, HDR10 support on a monitor&nbsp;for the Xbox&nbsp;can be very hit or miss, as they don't explicitly state HDR support, let alone HDR&nbsp;profiles (it must support HDR10 for the&nbsp;Xbox). That's another thing to keep in mind, if you want the best 4K&nbsp;experience.</p>

            <p>If I&nbsp;was going to get an X model , I would be looking at a 4K TV w/HDR rather than a monitor . This is coming from a 4K pc gamer that was an Xbox One S in my living room . Right now HDR on monitors are scarce , but some more are coming (MAYBE next year) .&nbsp; Invest in a good 4K TV , just stay away from Sony's (even has issues when using a PS4) and Samsung (you don't get their panels unless you pay the big bucks and they don't stand behind their warranty , plus any support disappears after 2yrs) . I just recently picked up a 4K 48" TV for my man cave from Fry's Electronics for $249.99 . Has 4 hdmi 2.0 ports with 2.2 HDCP . The only downside is no HDR . Supposedly has a Samsung panel (maybe their seconds?) , but who knows unless you take it apart . I have an HTPC I threw together hooked to it . When I boot the pc up it automatically turns on the display (only on port one though ) .&nbsp; Oh , the brand is Silo , built in California . The speakers are like monitor&nbsp;speakers (well maybe

            <p>you meant the U28-E-590D, that got an hdmi 2.0 and freesync,&nbsp;because the U28-D-590D, the older model,&nbsp;only have hdmi 1.4 meaning 4K@30hz that Xbox can't display. But then,&nbsp;&nbsp;you need to think if they are HDCP 2.2 compliant if you want to read content like 4K Netflix, and both of these monitors you cited, do not have.</p>

    <title>Overclocking x5460 and heat sink requirement&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overclocking x5460 and heat sink requirement&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am planning to build a cheap gaming PC using the following components:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU: X5460 (771 to 775 adapter attached)</p>
<p>MOBO: Asus P5G41T-M LX</p>
<p>RAM: Kingston HyperX FURY 8GB 1866mhz</p>
<p>HDD: 1TB 2.5 5400 (disk)</p>
<p>PSU: Corsair RM Series 450-Watt</p>
<p>GPU: ASUS Geforce 210 1GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to overclock the CPU to higher clock speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. How to over clock&nbsp; [I am completely new :P] and what is the speed limit here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. How I choose a not an overkill heat sink (how to calculate the heat that has to be dissipated and what to look for to find that heat sink)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. Do "Asus P5G41T-M LX" support overclocking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. If overclocking is not supported then will a common intel stock heat sink out of ebay, will do the trick?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is nothing related to Windows so please help if you guys could :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the by I love Microsoft :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Please go through my replies before answering, so that you get the real situation awareness :P</p>

            You're right--the questions are off-topic here. You should find a forum (and there are several) dedicated to PC mods and overclocking.&nbsp; Just an observation though--the Xeon processor shouldn't need to be overclocked if you're using an adequate video card,
 and the GeForce 210 is old technology and probably not much better than on-board video.

I know this :( but I am in a situation where in I have only this forum available to ask this :( its complicated :P
<blockquote>Just an observation though--the Xeon processor shouldn't need to be overclocked if you're using an adequate video card.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is a good tip, even though it is so, I still want more and&nbsp;more :P I was looking at i7 and then because of limited budget I am going for these old and mod and hacks&nbsp;:(</p>
<blockquote>The GeForce 210 is old technology.<br />

<p>This part I agree but...</p>
<blockquote>Probably not much better than on-board video. <br />
</blockquote>
<p>This part I don't :P</p>
<p>I know what an IGP is and I know how much powerful it can be.</p>
<p>I have been living and gaming with only IGPs for the last 15 years or more and that too with Intel IGPs not the&nbsp;AMD APUs, so please do not say anything bad about ma first ever GPU that I was able to buy two moths back :(</p>
<p>I know its nothing compared to the new gen and top ends at the present market. But it was available for dirt cheap rate&nbsp;at about&nbsp;$18 in eBay (used one).</p>
<p>I compared this GPU with ma IGPs in my previous PCs and Laptops.</p>
<p>This GPU is able to play all of the games that was playing in lowest settings in those devices, in the ultra settings. Did not try to&nbsp;rate it with&nbsp;FPS but still just the settings that I used and the performance it gave is enough to make me believe that this
 piece is better than IGP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, GTX 980, i7-4820k and an Asus 2011 MOBO are in my list for the upgrade, till then I need this to work :) So please help if there is anyone in MS&nbsp;who are into gaming and know these stuffs ^_^</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the by I really appreciate you for the reply :)</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overclocking&nbsp;can be done on most of the processors&nbsp;&nbsp;but there are chances where this might harm the processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is advisable to contact the&nbsp;&nbsp;particular processor manufacturer or&nbsp; the motherboard manufacturer &nbsp;for the support options.</p>

                    <p>I am getting an error trying to move a file with only a single character in the filename from one folder to another but I am getting an error that it is too long for the destination....
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fd29964-7a2f-4151-b40a-b5a3dfe68e59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>This is not the 1st time I have seen this ignorance with Windows, but in the past all I had to do was shorten the file name before moving it. However, this time that will not work as I have shortened it to a single character,
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/877348e9-4305-47a7-aa3a-662900eb681f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<strong>STILL</strong> too long.</p>
<p>I cannot shorten it to less than a single character or <strong>THAT </strong>will give me an error.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<em><strong>WOW I hate Microsoft</strong></em>*</p>
<p>What can I do about this please??</p>
<p><strong>THANKS</strong> in advance!!</p>

    <title>Cannot download Rainbow Six Vegas - Games with Gold - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot download Rainbow Six Vegas - Games with Gold</h2>
                    
<p>I'm from Poland, I had my account set up in 2008 but for UK as Poland wasn't an option back then. I know this might potentially be a problem, but it has never been before. I've been successful in downloading every single other Games with Gold game before.
 Rainbow Six vegas I S &nbsp; A V A I L A B L E in my region - see here: <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/pl-PL/Product/TCs-RainbowSix-Vegas/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802555307d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
marketplace.xbox.com/.../66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802555307d6</a></p>
<p>It says it's free for gold members. I get the error messages - from console "This content is not available from your location" and via website: "Your purchase cannot be completed at this moment. Please try again later". I've been trying to download it for
 3 days straight.</p>
<p>I refuse to migrate my account since I'm afraid I'll lose all Games with Gold forever and some of my bought games / DLC might be inaccessible.</p>
<p>I feel I am cheated and treated unfairly. I'd like this issue to be resolved as soon as possible but deep down I suspect I'll just miss out on this game.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>You're getting that error because your account region does not match your physical region. For region locked games both account, console and physical region must match.</p>
<p>The only way to download it is to ensure those regions match. You can migrate your account region to Poland. You will keep your downloadhistory and region free games and dlc won't be a problem. Region locked games and dlc might stop working.</p>
<p>Please read through this support site before making a region change if that is what you want to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../change-region</a></p>
<p>Also, you can only change region once every three months. There is no way to change more often.</p>
<p>Regards, Relnah</p>

<p>If you only did it recently you must wait till the proccess completes usually by waiting for the email</p>
<p>this isnt something you wait till the last min for</p>
<p>if you received the email then re download your profile and clear system cache</p>
<p>from your op you didnt want to migrate and refused to migrate</p>
<p>Even though you cant get certain region locked content anyways</p>
<p>you only lose access to content that was region locked</p>
<p>according to your op you refuse to.migrate from uk to poland</p>

<p>Thanks for clarifying. I will not move to another region, it is not worth doing this. do this only if you guys think that is advantageous. I think the general content of my region is better than this simple game. Well, this is just my opinion. Anyway, thank

<p>Hi, I am from the Czech Republic and facing the same problem. I have also switched to the UK region to have a better content on my XBOX. As you say switching back is a step back. No voice commands, no video and music apps, &nbsp;etc. After 8 years we have got
 nothing here in comparison with other countries. No vistas for the forthcoming future. What will bring the XBOX One to the countries that are not up on the list?
</p>
<p>We pay the same money and get just a fourth of all the services. What an expensive hobby we have got. Where's the problem? If it not your fault, Microsoft, tell us who prevents you from offering us, your supporter from Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, etc.
 Seems to me that we are not worth noticing. </p>

<p>With voice commands thats a limitation of accents for video apps well thats not ms fault international laws stare what you can and cannot view</p>
<p>video apps are region locked due to the licensing aggreements they sign with mpaa and the international version this has always been the case</p>
<p>if you want more apps start buging content providers</p>
<p>crackle is free in many countries</p>

            Hi, Gokerpamuk,
<br />
<br />I'm not exactly sure what you're wishing to do.. If you want a volume mixer, Try EarTrumpet (Free) from Microsoft Store.
<br />
<br />Launch Microsoft Store &gt; shopping bag icon in Taskbar
<br />Search for Volume Mixer. 
<br />There are several apps available.

<h2>            Downloads freezes KB925681 &#34;update not applicable&#34;</h2>
                    When I try to download something the download normally freezes somewhere. The same goes when I'm trying to view streaming video. Both downloads and streaming video stops loading. I've tried both Internet Explorer and Chrome. This is when i'm using my 3G
 modem. It seems that when I'm connected to the internet via WLAN it works.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I've tried the update recommended here:&nbsp;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925681 . The explanation about this being a problem with the USB-port makes sense.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But when I try to run the update it says that it's not &nbsp;applicable. I'm running Windows 7 home premium 64bit Swedish with service pack 1.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>I've also tried the download suggested below with the same result:</div>

            <span>Hi Mattias Ranbro,<br />
<br />
1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue occurred?<br />
2. Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
How to optimize Internet Explorer<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro</a><br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend
 that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.<br />
<b><br />
Method 2<br />
</b>For video problems with internet Explorer, try the steps from the following link:<br />

<b><br />
Method 3<br />
</b>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if you are able to perform the steps from kb925681.<br />
<br />
<b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />

Note: </b>Follow step 7 from the clean boot article KB929135 to put the computer back to normal mode.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 4<br />
</b>Disable antivirus and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Disable antivirus software<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
<b>Note:</b> <i>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />

            <div>Thankyou for trying to help me mr B.</div>
<div><br />
Answer to your questions:
<div>1. No I haven't made any changes. Other than the Windows updates.</div>
<div>2. No error message. The download just stops receiving data. The streaming video just stops loading.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding Method 4:</div>
<div>I have Avast antivirus installed now but the problem&nbsp;occurred before. I had to use another computer to download Avast.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding method 1 and 2:</div>
<div>This is not a problem restricted to Internet Explorer but instead I have the same problem with chrome and download managers. Also it's not a problem when i'm using the built in WLAN instead of a 3G modem connected to the USB-port.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll try method 3.</div>

            I followed the instructions in "Method 4". Booted the computer with no autostart and only the microsoft services enabled. Then I tried to install the update recommended in&nbsp;
<span>kb925681. But the update still wouldn't run. Got another error message though -&nbsp;</span>0x80070422. Something to do with a service not being available.
<div><br />
<div>My guess is that the suggested update in KB925681 only is for Windows 7 without Service pack 1 installed. Is this update included in sp1? If not there should be another update for Windows 7 Service pack 1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can anyone help?</div>

            One more thing. How did my question end up in the Internet Explorer section? My problem has nothing to do with Internet Explorer. Rather it should be in the Windows 7 update section.

<p><br />
With all due respect...</p>
<p>1. If KB925681 was not offered to your computer by Windows Update, your problem is not being caused by Windows Update functionality.</p>
<p>2. If Win7 SP1 is installed, KB925681 is "not applicable" to your computer (i.e., the version of Usbser.sys currently installed on your computer supersedes the version KB925681 would install).</p>
<p>That being said...</p>
<p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each&nbsp;of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>1b. Did Win7 come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7, or did you upgrade from Vista to Win7?
</p>
<p>2a. Is Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (already) installed? See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Which version of the Windows operating system am I running?<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running</a>
</p>
<p>2b. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?&nbsp; See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</a> </p>
<p>3. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. Are ALL of the following updates listed in <strong>View installed updates</strong> (<em>not</em> Update History)? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2618444, KB2639417, KB2620712, KB2619339; KB2641690, KB2588516 &amp; possibly KB2633171</p>

            Now where getting somewhere. OK I'm taking some time now to answer all the diagnostics questions...
<div><br />

<div>1.b Preinstalled.</div>
<div>2a. Yes - sp1 is installed</div>

<div><br />
<div>3.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have currently the free Avast antivirus installed.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have almost a year left before I need to renew my Avast license.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have disabled defender.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't have any other firewall than Windows firewall.</div>
<div><br />
<div>(Mind you, when this problem started I didn't have Avast installed and defender was still activated. I couldn't download Avast because of this problem, but instead I had to use another computer for the download.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>4 and 5. There was a trial version of McAfee that came with the computer. I deinstalled that piece of software one immediately when I got my computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6.</div>
<div><span>KB2618444 - Yes</span></div>
<div><span>KB2639417 - Yes</span></div>

<div><span>Windows Internet Explorer installed</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>Also I've tried using two different 3G modems and my cellphone for internet access. All with the same result.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, at first, when the computer was brand new I didn't have this problem.</div>

            Hi SandC
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Go ahead and do the clean install without any worry about product key / activation issue.
<br />
<br />If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.
        </p>

            Hi #SandC, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a Product Key and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 3 benefits, you can skip entering a Product Key, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to keep using Focus Follows Mouse but I don't want the window in focus to come to the front unless I click on it. I've had to do a reg edit on windows 7 to do this before and that was a long time ago. How do you fix this issue now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Mark&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Again I’d like to keep the window active by hovering over and the only thing I don’t want is the bringing the active window to the front part. I’ve fixed that via a reg edit (subtracting 0x40 from a value) and that works.
 I like the active window follows the mouse but don’t like the bringing of the active window to the front. (I prefer X behaviour where you can read and inactive windows text and do work in the active window that is partly covered up.)</span></p>

<h2>            How to use credit in my Microsoft account to buy from the Microsoft store&#63;</h2>
                    I have received a Microsoft gift card and redeemed it to my account, but when I try to buy a keyboard from the Microsoft store, there is no option to use the credit towards the purchase. Instead it just shows that I will be paying the full amount. I'm
 accessing the store from a browser instead of the app. Does the credit only work in the app (and therefore only with digital products)?

                    <p>Witam</p>
<p>Dnia 3.12.2018 roku zakupiłem w sklepie stacjonarnym kod aktywacyjny Xbox Live GOLD na 6 miesięcy. Po przyjściu do domu wpisałem kod na stronie. Subskrypcja nie przedłużyła się. Skontaktowałem się z pomocą techniczną Microsoft. Według ich kod został przypisany
 do mojego konta, ale nie został aktywowany. Radzili mi zaczekać do końca starej subskrypcji, po której nowa powinna się automatycznie aktywować. Dnia 15 grudnia wygasła mi stara subskrypcja wygasła a nowa nie została aktywowana. Czy ktoś miał podobny problem
 lub wie jak go rozwiązać?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;Hello On 3.12.2018, I bought an Xbox Live GOLD activation code in a store for six months. After coming home, I entered the code on the website. The subscription did not prolong. I contacted Microsoft technical support. According to

 was not activated. Has anyone had a similar problem or knows how to solve it?]&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hi _Artur_,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! If you've redeemed a code, but it did not apply to your account, it's best to call back using the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/conatct-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> portal and speak to an agent. Over the phone we should be able to troubleshoot the code and get your account's subscription active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            VB6 application - Path not found error 76 in Windows 10 but works perfectly in windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am trying to run this simple application made by vb6 to run in Windows 10. The application basically copies/backup all the files/folders from mapped network shared (drive K) to its local drive D:\prodbackup every day, MWF, TTHSat and weekly folder
 will be created and it will overwrite all the files. Its been a week trying to fixed this problem but I'm getting no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This application works perfectly in Windows 7 and few Windows 10. This application is not a build installer or the programmer did not make an installer. We just copy and pasted it to another computer that need to be backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not familiar with Windows 10 environment, Im not sure if its looking in some dll files or system32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me. TIA.</p>

<p>Hello Parrotice66, <br />
<br />
Is this something that just happened or has it been happening for awhile when you try to oopen minimized programs?<br />
Can you go back to a System Restore point to before it was happening? <br />
<br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type “System Restore” and hit enter<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option “choose a different restore point” and hit next</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.<br />
<br />
If still having problems, do you get any error message or does the computer hang?</p>
<p>I suggest you check the event viewer and see if you have any errors there that might shed a light on what is happening.<br />
<span><span>To open Event Viewer: Click the Start button. In the Search box, type Event Viewer, and then, in the list of results, double-click Event Viewer.<br />
Be sure to check the application and system event logs. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please reply back with an update and let us know the details.</span></span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Change screen resolution and check if you are to connect projector to computer, follow the steps in the following link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-resolution</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the above step fails update display driver and check if the issue persists, follow the steps in the following link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></div>

            I don't think I was specific enough, I apologize, the screen itself works fine, I can extend my screens no problem. &nbsp;When I try to make the other screen, (not my laptop screen), my main display it goes white and stays. &nbsp;The screen is a &nbsp;Liquid Video A170E101
 Monitor if that helps at all. &nbsp;The screen came from a buddy's old computer that he got rid of so he gave me his monitor, again, the monitor works fine, it's just when I try to make it my main display.

<p>When you buy a movie you should be able to watch it on multiple devices. &nbsp;Thats the last movie I buy on Xbox video due to this issue. &nbsp;Amazon and Vudu allow you to watch movies on multiple devices including the Xbox. &nbsp;Mistake on my part for buying it on
 Xbox video. &nbsp;Buyer beware.</p>

            You can watch it on multiple devices. They're just not devices you own already.<br />
<br />
Using Apple as an example is disengenuous. iTunes cannot be used on the 360, Windows Phone, or Android.<br />
<br />
If you want everything to be usable on a tablet, buy a Windows 8 tablet. PCs can playback everything.

<p>Buyer beware? I guess your not use to technology and companies restricting use of their content to their devices. Like IceStorm said, Apple does this yet you own an IPad. You should be mad at them as we'll for not having a better relationship with companies
 to enable cross device streaming of content. Don't hate the player hate the game</p>

<p>I understand what you are sayings and it is quite foolish. On one hand your complaining that Xbox won't allow you to watch the movies you bought on a different device that isn't apart of their product line, and on the other hand your using an Apple iPad.
 But to each is own</p>

<p>Let me explain, I bought 5 movies on Xbox. &nbsp;The only way I can watch them is on a Xbox or PC. &nbsp;When you buy movies from Amazon or VUDU you can watch them on XBox, PC's, Ipads, Iphones, Roku, literally anything. &nbsp;Amazon movies are universal. &nbsp;So all I am
 saying is why buy movies from Xbox video when you can optimize your viewing choices buy buying the same movies on a Amazon or VUDU. &nbsp;The xbox plays everything. &nbsp;Its a excellent viewing device. &nbsp;All I am saying is do not BUY your movies from XBOX VIDEO since
 you limit where the movies you own can be seen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what I found: Insert the game disc into the disc drive.</p>
<p>Note After you insert the disc, the default option is to automatically start the game. If the game starts, exit the game, and return to the Xbox Dashboard.</p>
<p>Go to Home.</p>
<p>Highlight the game you want to install with your controller.</p>
<p>Press X on your controller.</p>
<p>Select Install to Hard Drive.</p>

<p>Do you want some sauce with that copy pasta? My description says "I remember it used to be done by pressing X on your game then there was an option to install, but this no longer seems to exist?".</p>
<p>It takes you to some strange, Kinect-themed abyss that is known as the Marketplace. The only options here are to download the demo, rate the game, add a pin (what even is a that?), and/or download add-ons. No use at all.</p>

<p>That´s option stills in dashboard</p>
<p>When you put a game you have to wait after read the disk, after that will show the name game and options (if i remeber well A to play, Y to eject , B to cancel and if i remember well , X buttom for the option MORE DATAILS.</p>
<p>Inside that option you have 4 others options = play game , evaluate, give a pin and install the game (i remember you that option is a life saver for your disc drive but you still need the disc for play the game!!!)</p>
<p>I hope ihelp you and forgive my bad english it´s self learnerd.</p>

<p>What game are you attempting to install? I assume it's a recent one, but I wanted to be certain. Some older games like Crackdown can't be installed, so I just want to eliminate that possibility. Have you checked to see if a different game disc gives you
 the option to install? I'm wondering if this is game-specific or if something is genuinely wrong with your 360 somehow (though I've never heard of something like this).</p>

<p>It's for Forza 4 mate, I've got 60+ gigabytes left too. It's the same issue for all my games though. I've got a couple installed, from when the pre-kinect *cough*WORKING*cough* theme was still installed, via the X button technique.</p>
<p>Xbox is fine in every way, just this instruction listing is missing or buried in the depths of the abyss itself. Tried everything for tonight, giving up hope now haha.</p>
<p>Sorry if I seemed snappy earlier, was (still am) a little bit pissed at Microsoft not fixing things that everyone complained about... oh what was that... 1 year ago? Yeah about there.</p>

    <title>Black Screen with Cursor after closing a full-screen program - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Black Screen with Cursor after closing a full-screen program</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to play a game that doesn't have a windowed mode.</p>
<p>When I close or minimize the program, I get a black screen with a changing cursor that acts as if the screen is still there (e.g. If I have a webpage open, the cursor changes to a hand where the links are).</p>
<p>It's also happening to all other programs with a full-screen mode, but I set these programs to windowed mode.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me why this is happening and/or how to fix this? The only way I found to fix it was to either:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;a.) Go back to the program if I minimized it</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;b.) Reboot</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            Many games designed to run in fullscreen mode don't like what you describe. If you try switching between the game and the desktop by pressing Alt-Tab, for example, they often don't understand the change of video modes and can't find a way to restore their
 own mode. If you treat them like a windowed program ("close" and "minimize" are commands for programs in a window, not for fullscreen-only apps), the same thing happens, resulting in a black screen in both cases. Sometimes you may be lucky, but to stay on
 the safe side, I would only exit such a game by in-game commands ("Quit? Y/N").

<p>I see what you're saying, but I tried to use the in-game quit button and still had the same problem.</p>
<p>Here are some more details about my display settings.</p>
<p>Resolution: 1360x768</p>
<p>Color Quality: 32 bit</p>
<p>The game I am running runs in a 256 color mode and uses the resolution 800x600. The other options for the game are 640x480 and 1024x768.</p>
<p>Thanks Anyway</p>

            If it happens with the in-game "quit", too, it may be that the game fails to shutdown properly and the game executable is still running (without display). Look at your task manager (either normally or by ctrl-alt-del, if you can't reach the taskbar) and
 kill the game's process there, if it's still present.

            See, the thing is I can't do anything. If I start the task manager, I can't actually see it. I've tried compatibility mode and the "run in 256 colors" checkbox to no avail. I've also tried running it in Virtual PC, but for some reason it won't run in that
 at all. Before I put it into compatibility mode, I would get a box that said that there was an exception raised- Windows Driver Unknown. Does that mean anything?

            Perhaps you could tell about which game you're talking. That would help to find a solution and track down the problem. An error "Windows Driver unknown" is new to me - what's a "Windows Driver"? Was this the exact wording of the error message? Btw: Don't
 give up. I've yet to find a program/game/driver that really doesn't work on Windows 7.

            Try this:<br />
1. Create a new desktop shortcut that points at cmd.exe. Call it Console.<br />
2. Right-click this shortcut, then run it as Administrator.<br />
3. Type the following command and press Enter:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxyyzz" /del<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (replace xxyyzz with the user's account name)<br />
<br />
If you also wish to get rid of the user's profile folder, do this:<br />
4. Reboot the machine.<br />
5. Log on as Administrator.<br />
6. Open a Console session as it Step 2 above.<br />
7. Type this command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rd /s /q "c:\Users\xxyyzz"<br />
Note: This method will permanently delete all files and folders in the user's profile folder. They will not be retrievable. If unsure about this action, use the following command instead:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren "c:\Users\xxyyzz" "xxyyzz.junk"<br />
Now wait a few weeks before deleting the folder permanently.<br />
