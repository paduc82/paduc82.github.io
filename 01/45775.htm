<h2>            Printer&#47;Scanner Problem Windows 10 Compatibility</h2>
                    I just had my laptop upgraded to Windows 10. I have a printer/scanner that used to work well with my Windows 8.1 laptop, now after I upgraded to Windows 10, believing that there will be no issues like these, my laptop can't detect my scanner now (or the
 scanner-part of my printer). So what should I do? I don't want to regret upgrading my laptop to Windows 10, and so far I am. (Note : I've been able to print. Only the scanning thing has a problem)<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbcc41ff-aa72-4b29-8adc-ce70b38e70c0" />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query at Microsoft community.</p>
<p>Could you provide us the make and model of the Printer/Scanner? You can visit the manufacturer website and download the latest drivers and check if it helps.</p>

            hi, I had the exact same problem. I have a multifunction printer/scanner and it would only recognise the printer. If you click the add printer or device button in 'hardware and sound' it should detect your multi function device. click yes to use the existing
 driver, and the new device will show up and allow access to the scanner part of the device.

            <p>Post the model printer-scanner and also how the scanner is attached to the network or the computer--directly or wirelessly. &nbsp;Scanning software is available at the printer manufacturer's site. That should be installed to get the scanner to work. Windows can
 supply drivers in most cases, but not the scanning utility. My Epson AIO could not use the drivers from the manufacturer, but would not scan until the software was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably know that wireless scanning cannot be done unless the printer-scanner is connected to the router, not connected to another computer on the network. Printers can be shared if connected to another computer, but not scanners.</p>

            <p>My issue is similar, but not exactly the same. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before upgrade to Windows 10, I could scan to my PC, or scan to a card or flash drive plugged in to the printer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrade, scanning to the card or flash drive works, but not to the PC. The pc recognizes the printer and scanner. When I open the scanning software on the PC and click scan, the document fees through the ADF, the scanner scans, and I get a prompt on
 the PC to save or add to the file. I click save, and the software shuts downs, says "ABBYY FineReader will be terminated: ABBYY Licensing Service is unavailable: The RPC server is unavailable. Please contact your system administrator to solve this problem."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer is an Epson Workforce 840. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Epson's web site. There was a link to an article "can I scan after upgrading to Windows 10?" I read the article, downloaded the scanner driver and utility file from the site, installed on my PC, but still no luck. In fact, after this install, while
 the printer and scanner are still "seen" by Windows 10, all print jobs are marked "error" in the queue, and the scanning works exactly as I described above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent a message to Epson, and to ABBYY, this morning. Have not heard back from either yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustration is setting in...I scan pictures for my genealogy research regularly. I need this to work!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>

            <p>,Update---I fixed my problem---Go to control panel, then All control panel,, then troubleshooter, then devises/hardware (or whatever tha tis called) then &nbsp;printers. After that the steps are fuzzy in my memory but the essence&nbsp;is---go to spooler service, then
 take it off of automatic and put it on "manual&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;then &nbsp;click reset (or was it restart?) the spooler service&nbsp;." Then put it back on&nbsp;automatic . If it asks you to apply somewhere in all of this do that too. Then close all boxes and windows.
</p>
<p>When I went back to the list of devises on my computer&nbsp; the computer DID&nbsp;show my printers again, which it would not do when the spooling was off,&nbsp; and I was able to print from WORD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck! </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suspect we all are having a similar problem. My problem is my computer no longer&nbsp;&nbsp; recognizes my printer and will not add it because "my print spooler service has stopped working. " I am running a full virus scan to see if I can detect a corrupted file,.
 If that does not help me, my computer guy says I&nbsp;will need to take in my computer and printer to him because he does not know why Windows 10 messed up my spooler.&nbsp; He says I should have waited for the Windows 10 bugs to be fixed before I installed . What a
 bummer!!!!! </p>

            <p>I actually got mine to work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the all-on-one printer, re-booted, went to the Epson web site and downloaded installed the most recent drivers, and everything worked fine after that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny part was I had already installed the most recent drivers, but that's what killed the printer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstall/reinstall, it works for me now. </p>

            <p>I have this same problem. Before upgrading from 8.1 to Windows 10, I had issues connecting to the printer in general once in a while. To fix, I would reconnect the usb cable and try again, problem solved. Now, the printer is working fine from all usb ports,
 but I get this same error as Josiah Quising displays above whenever I try to scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use an HP Officejet Pro 8600 printer, and have tried reconnecting to different usb ports, restarting the printer and computer, reinstalling the device software, and running the troubleshoot dialog, without success. Please respond ASAP.</p>

<p>About once a day I get this screen when my PC crashes. This occurs solely from Facebook issues, most commonly when loading a new photo or video. I have a Windows 8.1 PC. Please let me know what other information I may need to provide as well as any possible
 solutions. I can't help but feel like this might possibly have something to do with my GPU but I'm not sure. Thank you for your time in viewing!</p>

            <p>The issue appears to be solely with the GPU or GPU driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AMD Radeon R9 200 Series GPU&nbsp;has had numerous reports of similar BugCheck A0000001 errors caused by the atikmdag.sys as in the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.amd.com/game/messageview.cfm?catid=440&amp;threadid=169383&amp;STARTPAGE=1&amp;FTVAR_FORUMVIEWTMP=Linear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.amd.com/game/messageview.cfm?catid=440&amp;threadid=169383&amp;STARTPAGE=1&amp;FTVAR_FORUMVIEWTMP=Linear</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some suggestions in the link you could consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might suggest to re-seat the graphics adapter and uninstall the presently installed graphics adapter driver&nbsp;and install an older version such as the one that may have been supplied with the disc that came with the adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem may however be a faulty GPU which would have to&nbsp; be replaced.</p>

<p>Morpheus prendi tutti i giochi usciti e valuta gli obbiettivi, in parcentuale quanti si realizzano solo per bravura estrema del giocatore? A non contare quelli realizzabili online visto che variabili in gioco(non dovute ne al gioco ne al giocatore ma che
 comunque influenzano) sono molte.</p>

<p>mah, ad esempio gli obiettivi che ottieni procedendo nella storia offline sono di abilità, non si procede semplicemente accendendo l'xbox. Vero che gli obiettivi online spesso sono solo una somma di punti, e quiindi gioca e rigioca, prima o poi ci arrivi,
 ma è anche vero che se sei scarso ci metti 3 anni (e quindi non lo sblocchi).</p>
<p>Non so, mi sbaglierò ma il 70% sono "di abilità". Però questo argomento che hai tirato fuori meriterebbe un topic a parte perchè è interessante, che dici?</p>

<p>Anche si.</p>
<p>Sarebbe anche da dire che moltissimi obiettivi che magari si sbloccano nella modalità storia(per quei giochi che ce l'hanno) sono ampliamente conosciuti(tra siti e video) percui sapendo già come sbloccarli la loro difficoltà è esigua.</p>
<p>Io non sarei cosi di manica larga un 15% per me sono gli obiettivi che si sbloccano per pura abilità del giocatore il resto o li fai perchè ti ci metti ssotto, o perchè li fai a culo o perchè ti metti daccordo con altra gente.</p>
<p>Escludo le modalità ruberia al conteggio.</p>
<p>Prima che qualcuno parta anche a tirare fuori gli obbiettivi online speigo solo perchè non li conteggio.</p>
<p>Teniamo conto che non abbiamo tutti linee uguali e miriade di variabili falsanoil gioco alla pari.
</p>
<p>Ma vi faccio un esempio pratico(proprio per aggiungere forza alla mia idea) perchè anche le leaderboard sono falsate:</p>
<p>Io gioco a un picchiaduro 2d, bon ho una linea internet di merda e continuo a perdere(dico sempre ai miei avversari che vincono per quello), naturalmente non sblocco obiettivi ne salgo di classifica.</p>
<p>Bene si crea un torneo nazionale dove si gioca tutti(alla pari) davanti a una console e si fanno le sfide.</p>
<p>Partecipa tantissima gente che mi è sopra in classifica, che hanno sbloccato obiettivi e che mi prendeva per il culo.</p>
<p>Ok gli apro il deretano per una giornata intera.</p>
<p>Vinco il torneo, io so di essere bravo, ma loro perdenti tornano a casa(piangendo): con gli obiettvi attivi, alti di classifica e che continuano a prendere in giro chi sta sotto attestando che la leaderboard online e lo sblocco degli obiettivi è l'unico
 modo per conteggiare la bravura in un gioco.</p>
<p>Questo esempio vale per qualsiasi altro gioco.</p>

<p>Il caso di linee ADSL così drammatiche non è frequente, con una linea "nella media" troverai quello con il lag migliore, come quello con il lag peggiore (ci sono partite con 24 giocatori per volta-non possono essere sempre tutti superiori!). Nel tuo caso
 specifico posso capire, ma non puoi prenderti a "media" dei giocatori.</p>
<p>Per l'offline, non capisco la differenza tra "metterti sotto" e l'"abilità". Se mi applico nel fare una cosa divento più abile, no? Poi posso diventare "molto" più abile, o "poco", ma comunque non è che vedendo un video dell'obiettivo riesco a sbloccarlo,
 al massimo mi semplifica la cosa (tra l'altrio i video sono a disposizione di tutti).</p>
<p>Li finisco "a culo"? Una cosa tipo Club Mile High a culo? Essù...</p>
<p>Il tuo mi sembra un pò il discorso del tennista che perde le partite dando la colpa ai rimbalzi...</p>

<p>para este error lo que puedes hacer es abrir los puertos de tu enrutador que son los siguientes:</p>
<p>Abra los siguientes puertos:</p>
<p>• Puerto 88 (UDP) &nbsp;</p>
<p>• Puerto 3074 (UDP y TCP) &nbsp;</p>
<p>• Puerto 53 (UDP y TCP) &nbsp;</p>
<p>• Puerto 80 (TCP) &nbsp;</p>
<p>si eso no funciona lo que puedes hacer tambien es configurar to red de xbox manualmente acuerdate que el IP de la consola tiene que ser diferente al IP de la computadora.
</p>
<p>Por ejemplo si tu computadora tiene un IP de 192.168.1.5 agregale 10 al ultimo numero ents el IP de tu Xbox sera 192.168.1.15
</p>
<p>tambien te comento que a avido varios problemas con proovedores de internet como infinitum, cablemas, y telcel que estan actualizando sus redes affectando a muchos clients de Xbox live. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ojala y esto te ayude :) </p>

<p>Si de hecho ya habilité los 3 puertos. Y si. Mejoró un poco. Ya q anteriormente me desconectaba al minuto de entrar a live. Y ahorita ya me saca en 15 min. O más.. Y ps ojala y si sea problema de los proveedores. Ya q si no lo es tendré.q cambiar de consola.!
 Te agradezco mucho.! Gracias</p>

            Thank you Andre and lwwinter for your replies.&nbsp; Although these solutions may work, for me they came a bit late, because about a week ago I grudgingly took Marilyn's advice, and bought a copy of Office 2003.&nbsp; I felt a little held for ransom as I did so.&nbsp;
 But Office 2003 installed quickly and cleanly and seems to have cured the MSAgent error messages and the forgotten passwords in Outlook.&nbsp; It also seems to have fixed a "trying to modify Normal.dot" error message produced by MS Word XP.&nbsp; I actually prefer the
 UI of Office XP over Office 2003, but the apparent solidity of Office 2003 on Win7 trumps Office XP.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all for your help.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Black Screen Persists - How to get to Safe Mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Gateway NE56 series laptop with WIN 8.1. &nbsp;This week I allowed some updates. &nbsp;When I restarted, the company logo and star circle timer came up, then the screen goes to black. &nbsp;The hard drive appears to be doing something since its light flickers.
 &nbsp;With no screen, I cannot use any of the MS desktop facilities to get to Safe Mode.</p>
<p>I have tried to restart and use F8 and Shift F8 and "hold Shift, power off and restart" to get me to boot to Safe Mode. &nbsp;So far, nothing works.</p>
<p>I made a Gateway recovery disk, but when I insert the disk and power on, it sounds like the drive is operating but it does not seem that the machine is booting from that disk.</p>
<p>I have tried to get to the BIOS screen, and did once. &nbsp;It displayed a one line choice to use the Microsoft Boot option. &nbsp;I could not adjust the boot order from there.</p>
<p>This is getting to be a frustrating PITA. &nbsp;Can anyone advise how else I might try to reach a Safe Mode restart? &nbsp;Any and all help will be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks, sdmike, for the good wishes. &nbsp;If I could get to a login screen, I would know when the laptop was in Windows, and either Shift + Restart or some of the other tools in the 7tutorials blog might help. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I have tried to turn off the machine,
 then Shift + Restart without luck, and have tried waiting up to 4 hours with the machine apparently asleep, then doing it. &nbsp;Neither have gotten me to a recovery or safe mode screen. &nbsp;I have restarted several times in a row, without a screen response.</p>
<p>If anyone coming home from the 4th weekend would recommend anything else, please do so. &nbsp;I could use the help as our daily Arizona workday meltdown sets in this week. &nbsp;Thanks all.</p>

            <p>Sorry, sdmike. &nbsp;The F8, F10, F11 and F12 keys did nothing when I started the machine. &nbsp;However, I can report RECOVERY with the hints from Linney. &nbsp;See that response for what poor old me needed to be reminded about.</p>

            <p>RECOVERY! &nbsp;Ah, sweet SUCCESS! &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Many, many thanks, Linney</em></span>.</p>
<p>What I needed to be reminded about was in your note about entering the BIOS. &nbsp;I needed to
<strong>use the F2 key at startup</strong>&nbsp; to get the machine (using UEFI) to go to a boot options menu. &nbsp;At that point I knew I could use a bootable disk or USB drive to try to get back to the repair options.</p>
<p>I went to the Microsoft at&nbsp;<a href="http://http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a>&nbsp;and used the tool there to create the bootable
 USB drive. &nbsp;You need either a new or newly formatted drive of at least 4 GB, and you can download for either a 32-bit or 64-bit system. &nbsp;You DO NOT NEED your purchase key number just to use the boot feature. &nbsp;If you need to replace Windows, however, you will
 need your key number.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Again, my thanks to the community and members for the timely help and just the right words to get the human memory element to work. &nbsp;Please understand that I took my first college degree B.C. (before computers - at least personal
 computers) and my first machine was a 3038 P.C. running DOS 1.1, if I remember correctly. &nbsp;Experience is helpful and usually useful, until changes occur with such rapidity that an older frame of reference becomes effectively useless. &nbsp;Must be time for me to
 take some update classes. &nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Issue Solved. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Although I'm pretty sure I could figure out the correct syntax for Windows Advanced Search if I worked on it for a while, a search of this sort is easy in Agent Ransack (which is free):&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I included the file extension because otherwise the search may return some non-text files in which a string of bits is recognized as a character even though it's not meant to be interpreted that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't make out the picture, the search term is simply the special character surrounded by double quotes -- "&amp;"</p>

<h2>            How do I manually set a date for a system restore point&#63;</h2>
                    I got a virus a few days ago and got it cleaned up and all, but now some of my games will not work. I'm wondering how to set a manual restore date on system restore? I looked at the program and can't seem to get beyond 5 days which was the last Windows
 critical update. I need to go back at least 7 or 8 days. I'm using Windows 7 Prof. Thanks!

<h3> scottfactor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photos App windows 10 lost all my facial recognition Naming assignments</h2>
                    I had invested a lot of time to name all of the people recognized by the Photos App. &nbsp; I just came back to my PC and all of the names have gone, forcing me to go through the whole process again. &nbsp; just horrible!!! &nbsp; I suspect it may have something to do
 with the fact that I just bought a new 2nd computer (a surface pro 6), but I have no idea...just a guess. &nbsp; either way, what a pain in the neck!!!!! &nbsp; does anyone know why this happened and if there is a way to avoid this in the future???? &nbsp; better yet, is
 there a way to get the naming back???

            Hi, Scott,
<br />
<br />Have you looked into your Pictures folder to determine if the info is intact?
<br />Check your OneDrive account and verify if the photos show there with the Recognition tag.

            Hi Scott,<br /><br />Sorry to hear what happened! Unfortunately, Windows wouldn't usually remember facial recognition names unless a backup or restore point has been made while the names were created.<br /><br />To check if you have an available backup or restore point: <br />This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app or driver, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.<br /> <br /><br />Select the Start  button, enter control panel, and then choose it from the list of results.<br />Enter recovery in the Control Panel search box.<br />Select Recovery &gt; Open System Restore &gt; Next.<br />Choose the most recent app, driver, or update on the list of results, and then select Scan for affected programs. You'll see list of items that will be deleted if you rem

            the names do not appear.&nbsp; However, I think your suggestion is not legit because I went ahead and added contact names to a group of photos and then went back to look precisely where you suggest and the names still do NOT appear in the pictures folder under
 the group by, contact name field. &nbsp; Windows Photo App just wiped out all the hard work I did and I noticed this happened on my 2nd computer too. &nbsp; this is just a total waste of an app. &nbsp; I would like someone at Microsoft to explain why this happened and I
 would also like to know if having your photos in OneDrive synced across multiple pcs somehow causes this to happen. &nbsp;

<br />OneDrive syncs my Photos and I've never noticed any changes other than there was a time they'd disappeared. It wasn't long after that they did reappear. .

<br />I suggest you use the Feedback Hub to report the issue to Support/Developers. They can look into the account and possibly restore  the photos.

            Were you  using Photos App or Windows Live Photo Gallery?
<br />I located this thread dated in 2015 - Facial Recognition in Photos is not available. The last few pages are 2018 posts and the feature is still not available.

<br />If you want to tag your photos, download the Free Irfanview app. It's an Image Editor like Photoshop or Corel.

<p><b>Maximum:</b> 32 GB (for Windows Server　2008　R2 Standard) or 2　TB (for Windows Server　2008　R2 Enterprise, Windows Server　2008　R2 Datacenter, or Windows Server　2008　R2 for Itanium-Based Systems)</p>

<p><b>Disk space and other requirements</b></p>
The following are the estimated disk space requirements for the system partition, as well as other requirements. The disk space requirements for Windows Server　2008　R2 for Itanium-Based Systems
 will vary from these estimates. Additional disk space may be required if you install the system over a network.
<b>Minimum</b>: 32 GB
<b>
<p>Note </p></b>Computers with more than 16 GB of RAM will require more disk space for paging, hibernation, and dump files.

<p>Super VGA (800 x 600) or higher-resolution monitor</p>

<p>Keyboard and Microsoft® mouse (or other compatible pointing device)</p>

<p>Internet access (fees may apply)</p>

<p><b>Important information about kernel-mode drivers</b></p>
Ensure that you have updated and digitally signed kernel-mode drivers for x64-based editions of Windows Server　2008　R2. (These include all versions of Windows Server　2008　R2 except
 for Windows Server　2008　R2 for Itanium-Based Systems.) 

<p>If you install a Plug and Play device, you may receive a warning if the driver is not digitally signed. If you install an application that contains a driver that is not digitally signed, you will not receive an error during Setup. In both cases, Windows
 Server　2008　R2 will not load the unsigned driver.</p>

<p>If you are not sure whether the driver is digitally signed, or if you are unable to boot into your computer after the installation, use the following procedure to disable the driver signature requirement. This procedure enables your computer to start correctly,
 and the unsigned driver will load successfully. </p>

<p>To disable the signature requirement for the current boot process:</p>





<p>4. Boot into Windows® and uninstall the unsigned driver.</p>


<p>For more information, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=66577. </p>
<b>Before you start Setup</b>
Before you install Windows Server　2008　R2, follow the steps in this section to prepare for the installation.

<b>Disconnect UPS devices.</b> If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your destination computer, disconnect the serial cable before running Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices
 that are connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause issues with the detection process.

<p><b>Back up your servers.</b> Your backup should include all data and configuration information that is necessary for the computer to function. It is important to perform a backup of configuration information for servers,
 especially those that provide network infrastructure, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers. When you perform the backup, be sure to include the boot and system partitions and the system state data. Another way to back up configuration
 information is to create a backup set for Automated System Recovery.</p>

<p><b>Disable your virus protection software.</b> Virus protection software can interfere with installation. For example, it can make installation much slower by scanning every file that is copied locally to your computer.</p>

<p><b>Run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool. </b>You should run this tool to test the random access memory (RAM) on your computer. To use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, follow the instructions in the Windows Memory
 Diagnostic Users Guide (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=50362).</p>

<p><b>Provide mass storage drivers.</b> If your manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file, save the file to a floppy disk, CD, DVD, or universal serial bus (USB) flash drive in either the root directory of the media
 or in one of the following folders: <b>amd64</b> for x64-based computers, <b>i386</b> for 32-bit computers, or
<b>ia64</b> for Itanium-based computers. To provide the driver during Setup, on the disk selection page, click
<b>Load Driver</b> (or press F6). You can browse to locate the driver or have Setup search the media.</p>

<p><b>Be aware that Windows Firewall is on by default.</b> Server applications that must receive unsolicited inbound connections will fail until you create inbound firewall rules to allow them. Check with your application
 vendor to determine which ports and protocols are necessary for the application to run correctly.
</p>

<p>For more information about Windows Firewall, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=84639</p>

<p><b>Prepare your Active Directory® environment with Windows Server 2008 R2 updates.</b> Before you add a domain controller that is running Windows Server　2008　R2 to an Active Directory forest or upgrade an existing domain
 controller to Windows Server　2008　R2, run Adprep.exe from the Windows Server　2008　R2 media on your existing domain controllers to prepare your domain and forest.
</p>

<p>To do this, use the following procedures. If you are performing an unattended installation, perform this step before you install the operating system. Otherwise, you will need to do this after you run Setup and before you install Active Directory Domain
 Services. </p>
<b>
<p>To prepare a forest</p>

</b>



<b>
<p>To prepare a domain</p>
</b>
<p>Perform this procedure for each domain where you want to install a domain controller that runs Windows Server　2008　R2.</p>




<p>After completing these steps, you can add domain controllers that are running Windows Server　2008　R2 to the domains you have prepared.
</p>
<p>The <b>adprep</b> command extends the schema, updates default security descriptors of selected objects, and adds new directory objects as required by some applications. For more information about
<b>adprep</b>, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50439</a></p>

            <p>Hello Dorothea,</p>
<p>Well you reach adobe by going to <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.adobe.com</a> . But you don't need to go there to remove a program in Windows. To remove a program from Windows go to Control Panel, select Programs and Features, and when it opens it opens
 to the uninstall a program page. There just click on the program you want to uninstall (Adobe Reader), and then click the word Uninstall from the menu bar. All done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<h2>            having problems accessing file</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have download files.&nbsp; When I click on them to run, Windows responds </p>
<p>that it can not access the file.&nbsp; It issues an error code 0x800704b3. </p>
<p>The corresponding message is </p>
<p>"The network path was either typed incorrectly, does not exist, or the network</p>

<p>your network administrator"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file is on my desktop so no network is involved and the path is correct.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi <strong>HenkSU</strong>,</p>
<p>1. What exactly happens when you try to launch the screen saver?<br />
2. How long have you been experiencing this problem?<br />
3. Have you recently installed or uninstalled any software? <br />
4. Are you experiencing this with all the screen savers in the list?<br />
5. Which version of Windows is installed on your computer?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I would suggest you to update the latest display drivers and check if the issue still persists.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
I recommend you to update the graphic drivers and see if it makes any difference. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance and then clicking Device Manager, if you are prompted for an administrator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, locate the device, and then double-click the device name.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Now try to follow the below provided link to Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly and check for the issue.<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If that does not work, create a new user account and check. If it works in a new user account, then probably your user account may have been corrupted and would need a fix.</p>
<p><strong>Create a user profile.<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></p>
<p><strong>Now check for the issue.</strong></p>
<p>Follow the below provided link to fix the corrupted user profile.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a></p>

                    <p>This is a Dell XPS 9100, windows 10 PRO. Preceding this sleep problem&nbsp;it had crashed because, somehow, the bios SATA mode had changed from RAID to&nbsp;AHCI (which broke the RAID but changing the bios SATA value&nbsp;back fixed that with no recovery necessary. This

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Corruption on the system file can sometime be a possible cause that makes your computer's functionality not work as intended and same goes with missing files on the system. That being said, we would like to know further information on your Windows 10 concern
 to pick up where you left of with the troubleshooting steps that you've initiated:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us the troubleshooting step that you've mentioned above?</li><li>Have you tested if the issue on a different user profile?</li><li>Have you also made any changes on your registry to modify your <strong>Power Options</strong>?</li><li>What is your current build and version of your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run our <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_power10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Easy Fix troubleshooter</a></strong> for the Power Settings to be troubleshot automatically. If in case that the issue still
 persists, we advise you to create a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new user profile</a></strong>. This is so we can ensure
 that the current user profile is not corrupted which can be one of the possible cause why the sleep function is not working. Another thing would be with configuring the settings itself. You can have the settings checked to ensure that all the settings are
 correct by following the <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power-winpc/computer-wont-wake-from-sleep-mode-windows-10/91bda12c-9fbb-4e98-9113-7f7b83e2a095">steps</a></strong> provided
 by <strong>Buzzybuzz</strong> last <strong>August 12, 2015</strong> as the steps he mentioned also applies to the concern you're experiencing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep us posted on the results.</p>

            Sure it is available - you just have to know who to ask!<br />
<br />
The only version I have is 1.6.30 and you can download that from my SkyDrive.<br />
<br />
The file you need is called:<br />
<br />
UPHClean-Setup.msi<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called UPHClean-Setup when the file name really needs to be called UPHClean-Setup.msi (if the downloaded file has no extension
 you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />

            It is curious that it seems to have disappeared from the Internet - I wonder how they do that...<br />
<br />
UPHC is supposed to be used to resolve issues with roaming profiles.<br />
<br />
If the issue you are having is not with roaming profiles, what is the issue you are have that you think UPHC will resolve?<br />
<br />
Do let us know if it resolves whatever your issue(s) happen to be.<br />

            <p>In my experience it seems to perform the necessary functions for local profiles. Namely properly closing the profile. In sites I have used it profile issues were almost non-existant. I know that is not conclusive proof but it is the best&nbsp;MS had to offer
 and it seems to work.</p>

            So you are having trouble shutting down?<br />
<br />
Do let us know if UPHC helps - I would be curious to know...<br />

            That is one of the issues that I have seen go away in many cases with UPHC. YMMV
