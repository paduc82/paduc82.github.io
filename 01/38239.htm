            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The issue you have reported is you are unable to copy the files to the pen drive to the new laptop and you are unable to format the pen drive. We need more information to assist you in a better way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you try connecting the pen drive to a different computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does other computer recognize the pen drive?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you get any pop-up or error when you connect the pen drive to the laptop?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you able to find the pen drive in the “Computer” folder when you connect it to the laptop?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you updated the drivers for USB drives?</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the laptop you are using?</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the pen drive?</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are the other external devices working fine apart from pen drive?</span></p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you try to connect the pen drive on a different port on the laptop?</span></p>
<p><span><span>10.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please try the methods below and check if this helps in resolving the issue with connecting the pen drive to the laptop. This issue might be because the drivers might not be installed or pen drive might have been corrupted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>: </span><span>Run hardware and devices troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Connect the pen drive to laptop.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the ‘<b>Windows + W</b>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <b>troubleshooting</b> in the search box and then press
<b>ENTER.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select <strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong><span>view all
</span></strong>and select <b>Hardware and devices</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click next and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>: Check</span><span> </span><span>USB pen is working fine on a different computer. You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then
 perform the following steps:</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a. Press <b>Windows key + X, </b>Click on <b>Device Manager</b>.</p></span>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In <b>Device</b> <b>Manager</b>, double click to expand "<b>Universal</b>
<b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>controllers</b>", right click on the Host Controller, click "<b>Uninstall</b>" and click "<b>OK</b>".<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check if there is an exclamation mark next to any of the drivers; it indicates issues with the driver installed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Repeat the step b to uninstall all items under "<b>Universal</b>
<b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>controllers</b>".<br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 8 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using windows update.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue sill persists I would request you to check for chipset driver updates which you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope </span><span>this helps. If the issue persists with the sharing files from pen drive, please get back to us. We are here to assist you.

</p><p>&nbsp;I have been using Skype on my phone to make and receive calls.</p>
<p>Today I received a video call and I answered it without realizing but I was going to be seen on video as well as the person who called me!!</p>
<p>I was not dressed and I was not presentable at the time the video call automatically started when I answered!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;is there a way &nbsp;I can answer a video call without the caller automatically seeing me on video also??</p>
<p>If not please tell me how to take the Skype app off my phone!!</p>

<p>Hello BKRN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Skype for Mobile devices does not have an option to answer calls (audio/ video) automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you want to answer a video call but does not want to show your video feed on the other end, you can turn off your video, here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>During a video call, tap <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34737_2a.png" />&nbsp; to turn your video on or off.</li></ul>
<p>There's no option to disable your video feed when starting a video call, you can turn it off as soon as you answered the video call. For&nbsp; more information, you may refer to this link:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34737/how-do-i-make-a-call-in-the-new-skype?q=How+to+make+video+calls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you. &nbsp;Since you say that I can't stop skype video calls to my cell phone BEFORE the video of me me starts up when I answser the call....then I need to know who to take the Skype ap OFF my cell phone please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was a terribly embarassing&nbsp;thing to happen and turning the video of&nbsp;me off AFTER it starts is just not a good solution.</p>

<p>Hello BKRN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we understand that you do not want to continue using Skype on your mobile device due to unable to turn off video feed before the video call starts, you may consider using Skype on a desktop. To know more about Skype for desktop, please refer to this
 link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA11099/how-do-i-find-my-way-around-skype-for-windows-desktop?q=Finding+your+way+aroud+Skype+for+desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I find my way around Skype for Windows desktop?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone wants to do a video call with you, you have the option to answer it as regular voice call then once you're ready, simply click the video call button to turn on your camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for deleting Skype application on your device, you may follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap and hold the Skype application and drag it to the <strong>trash </strong>
icon or <strong>Remove </strong>icon.</li></ul>

    <title>Installing Application on Different Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ab104  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Application on Different Drive</h2>
                    Hello. I am using Windows 10, and it is only allowing me to install an application to my 119GB hard drive rather than the 931GB drive that I paid for with my PC. I am trying to install Mirillis Action! to another drive so that I can record more than 30
 minutes worth of video without running out of memory, but it defaults back to "Local Disk (C:)" despite the location that I choose when installing the application. I have changed my Windows settings so that new apps should be downloaded to the 931GB drive,
 but it won't install there (https://gyazo.com/d39885fd6ff57e9f7514e01b76d35ac4). I applied the settings, removed Action! completely from my PC, and reinstalled it after selecting that I wanted it installed to New Volume (D:). It is still on my Local Disk,
 and I'm getting annoyed because I paid to be able to use that 931GB. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

            Even though you configured those settings and I have provided another link on how to do this, when you install an app sometimes they don't default and you have to change the drive.
<br />This is not a windows issue this is the app configured to default to C drive.
<br />In the link provided you will see firefox will try to default to C but you can just change the drive letter.
<br />Also be aware that any app you purchase from the Microsoft\Windows Store will go to the same drive your operating system is installed on.  This can not be changed unfortunately.

            I already tried changing the drive location on Action!, but it doesn't download it to the proper drive. I've been having issues with Windows on this computer (Windows 10 product key not working is a big one), so I'm assuming that it's another bug with
 Windows since I've never had an issue with Action! in the past. It works perfectly on my other computer that runs Windows 10, but suddenly it's having all sorts of bugs on Windows 10. I installed it to the D drive, but it still ends up on the C drive. I tried
 changing the output location of the video to the D drive, and that also doesn't work. I've already tried that link in my web searches, but it hasn't given me any working solution. Any other ideas of what the issue may be here?

            I would think that a recording program would record to whatever drive/folder you configured it to use and it doesn't need to be the same drive/folder where it is installed.
<br />
<br />I looked over the Action user guide and it clearly shows that the recording location can be specified as you wish. It doesn't have to be the drive where it is installed.

    <title>Skype ends every call after 6 seconds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ephesians525  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype ends every call after 6 seconds</h2>
                    Whenever I try to make a Skype call, the call ends after six seconds. This happens to any number, whether a local landline call or a call to a mobile number - it makes no difference. Every call that I make ceases after six seconds and never connects. I
 have an active Skype subscription which I have had ongoing and paid for several years now. Until recent changes to the Skype interface I have never had this issue before and calls have always been excellent however now I cannot make any calls whatsoever so
 my monthly subscription has been wasted for the last several weeks. I know that I am logged in to the Skype interface because I see my user profile image etc.

                    Does anyone know of an app for windows 8 that lets you write on top of PFDs that doesn't look like your drawing in MS Paint. I just bought a ideapad and in the attempt to replace the need to carry my iPad and older Vaio, but there is not an app that has
 the ability write as smoothly as any I have used on the ipad, particularly&nbsp;Notability. Also, none that I have used so far have had a useful sound recorder that allows you to record lectures and keep track of time while drawing on the PFD. As a student it is
 useful to be able to annotate the time in the recording on a particular slide and &nbsp;have audio when reviewing notes. So far I am super disappointed that my $1,500 Ultrabook can't replace a $500 tablet because the apps in the Windows 8 Store is weak sauce so
 far. Step it up Microsoft; I am banking on the assumption you have the ability to adapt.

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><span>You can continue to monitor the apps in the store for what you are looking for. If the computer supports it, you may be able to utilize
 two apps side by side to take notes while looking at the PDF file.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Alternatively, you can look for a desktop program to do the same.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>Hope it helps.</span></span></div>

            Just so Microsoft knows--and Matthew, if you haven't discovered it yet... Notability is EXACTLY what you're after. They don't have a Windows 8 app yet, (they're "considering" it, so the more people that request it the better off we'll be!) I've tried several,
 SEVERAL of these app's and Notability is the best.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Doesn't help you with your Windows 8 setup right now, I know... It's actually one of the things holding me back from switching the way you have. In any case, you can write (or draw) on blank sheets by hand or by keyboard, or you can do the same over pdf
 documents. Really great.</div>

totally agree with jason, microsoft need to address this urgently, noteability or equiv is a must have app before i consider dropping ipad to move. as a business user tablets just need note taking apps to be useful, &nbsp;I dont even carry paper or pens these days
 as noteability does it all. and the good news microsoft is there is still plenty that can be improved in that app so you dont have to set the sight on just matching you can really outclass.&nbsp;

            Whole-heartedly agree, I am a proud new surface pro owner, who was a bit shocked at the lack of features in the few note taking apps available.
<div><br />
<div>On the Ipad i was using Goodnotes which was phenomenal for what I need, viewing pdf documents and marking up with multiple options for highlighting, writing, shapes and also the function where the program could detect if i wanted to draw a circle, triangle,
 rectangle or straightline and if selected the program would auto correct. (useful for highlighting a line of text and instead of a rather squiggly line, it would straighten it up.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The app I am using at the moment on W8 is drawboard pdf. I used another app previously, but it converted all pdf's to jpgs and did not appear to nicely convert back.&nbsp;</div>

            I agree 100%.&nbsp; What would one need to do in order to lobby Microsoft to do such a thing.&nbsp; I have just started class and was sitting next to a guy who had this app and could not believe the functionality of it.&nbsp; Great APP and it would be nice if MS added
 or offered this.&nbsp; Also, is there a way to search for apps in the app store similar to XBOX or do we just get what is available?<br />

Thanks,<br />

            <p>I also use Notability on my iPad for work.&nbsp; It is the best and most versatile app out there.&nbsp; I just got a dell tablet and would really love to have the flexibility of that app or something similar.&nbsp; You can write, type or draw on a blank document.&nbsp; You
 can also import PDFs and write or type directly on them.&nbsp; It works great with any slide deck to have your notes on the slide.&nbsp; I highly recommend that Microsoft add this app to their selections.</p>

            <div>Just to add my pennyworth - mainly for Microsoft.&nbsp; </div>
<div>I am an academic and need to go through many draft papers and theses.&nbsp; Notability is ideal - a student can send a draft wherever you are onto which&nbsp;you can annotate, highlight, type - make any entries you would on hard copy - and send it straight back
 without the original pdf text being affected.&nbsp; An amazing App for students and teachers.</div>
<div>I now have a Dell tablet with Windows 8 (the XPS12 with flip around tablet).&nbsp; But I still need to lug my iPad around because I can't live without Notability!</div>

            I am an owner of the much talked about surface pro which promotes "productivity" as to why you should buy this product. &nbsp;I am surprised that this question was posed over a year ago and still to date no app available to do this. &nbsp;I wish something like Notability
 or GoodNotes was available for Win 8
<div><br />
<div>Wake up MicroSoft - I am quickly being turned off by your product.</div>

<div><br />
<div>I love my Mac, I love my ipad, I &nbsp;am also beginning to love my new windows machine with Win 8, let's face it we all winged about all new Win environments and yes, they all need plenty of work once they are released but I'm still up for working with organisations

<h2>            All &#34;media buttons&#34; stopped working. AGAIN. Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>This is the third time this has happened to me, and this time it's the last straw because none of the "fixes" i did the other two times work this time.</p>
<p>To be a bit more clear on what I mean by "media buttons" is next/prev. track, play/pause, vol up/down, mute, and stop. NO, it is nothing to do with my keyboard, because even sending the key(s) through a mouse or program doesn't work.<br />
</p>
<p>I have googled this to DEATH, and I can't even find one case of ANYONE ELSE having this problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It may be useful to know how I fixed it the other two times.</p>
<p>First time, I honestly don't know what I did. One day as randomly as it stopped working, it started working again.</p>
<p>(I reinstalled Windows at some point between the first time this happened and the second time.)</p>
<p>Second time, I uninstalled Windows Media Player and restarted about 4 times and then remembered to check if it worked and it did.</p>
<p>This time, Windows Media Player is still gone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the player I am using, because it has nothing to do with it. (Mute and volume up/down don't work even if it is not open.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Edit</p>
<p>I forgot some things...</p>
<p>sfc /scannow didn't solve anything.</p>
<p>The drivers are up to date on everything.</p>
<p>I have tried doing a "clean boot" and had no results.</p>
<p>I have tried booting in safe mode.</p>
<p>I have tried a system restore to before the problem started.</p>

<div>I troubleshot "Playing Audio", just in case it helps, and got "Enable AMD High Definition Audio Device." as an available fix, so I applied it. It said the problem has been fixed (The AMD HD Audio Device not being enabled "problem") so I closed that window.
 I am restarting my computer right now to see if that helped.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Edit:</div>
<div>It seems that troubleshooting "Playing Audio" didn't help. I didn't really expect it to, but it was worth a try.</div>

            <p>Obviously you need driver for that. Windows has generic one, (which ussually works fine with most of lap tops), but this one is not good for you.</p>
<p>First you should check if there are any windows updates (cause windows has that nice feature to find some drivers itself). If everything is updated there, go to Device manager in system and see if there are any problems there (black exclamation mark in yellow
 triangle). If it is, try searching manually driver for that hardware. If even that doesn't work go to support website and install drivers that you haven't already installed. (if not sure install all connected to media)</p>
<p>More info on lap top model would be nice info here. </p>

Obviously I already have the drivers, it randomly stopped working after working for 3 and a half months (Since I upgraded my computer, reinstalled windows while I was at it.)

            Yeah, many friends that&nbsp;I have similar problem, but many have left it unsolved cause they just couldn't find proper driver for that. (sorry&nbsp;I thought it was lap top, and in that case it may have been easier). Are those media buttons on keyboard?

    <title>Why does the volume on my laptop keep dropping even after I&#39;ve - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scary carey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does the volume on my laptop keep dropping even after I&#39;ve raised it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Though it doesn't happen every single time I use my computer, I have noticed quite a bit that the volume on my laptop seems to drop after I've raised it in order to listen to music.&nbsp; It's been happening off and on over the past couple of years, if I remember
 correctly.&nbsp; Sometimes, restarting my laptop works, but other times it doesn't.&nbsp; I uninstalled the sound software and found that the problem continued after it was reinstalled.&nbsp; I've gone through every possible Help and Support link in order to check for possible
 problems, but nothing seems to touch on this aggravating issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an HP Special Edition from 2007 that includes a touchpad above the keyboard where I can raise and lower the volume, but I haven't used that in a long time.&nbsp; I usually just adjust the volume with the speaker icon.&nbsp;

    <title>My Imminent Job Interview Using Skype for Business - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelwalsh3  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Imminent Job Interview Using Skype for Business</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The day after tomorrow I will be interviewed for a job.&nbsp; The interviewer e-mailed me and let me know that they will be using Skype for Business.&nbsp; I went to that site, but as far as I can tell, I would have to subscribe in order to use it (or at least, to
 initiate a call using it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this perception is&nbsp;<span>correct</span>, then I presume that the interviewer will initiate the call.&nbsp; Will they do that by e-mailing me a link, which I will then use by going to Skype.com and pasting the copied link there?&nbsp; Or would I paste the link at
 Skype.com/interviews?&nbsp; Or would I paste the link at a site other than those two?&nbsp; Or would I simply&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">click</span>&nbsp;on the link and it will then take me to the page on which I will need to be?&nbsp; Or something else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this perception is&nbsp;<span>not</span>&nbsp;correct, and I&nbsp;<span>can</span>&nbsp;join the interview using Skype for Business myself, could you please let me know how I would do that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                </div>

<h3> debraswartz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail Error ID&#58; 0x800CCC0E, Socket Error&#58; 10060 - SMTP settings stopped working around the same time a filesharing problem started</h2>
                    Trying to send email with Windows Live Mail to my work account, I started to get this error:<br />
<br />
The connection to the server has failed.<br />
<br />
Subject 'test smtp'<br />
Server: 'my.servernamehere.com'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC0E<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 25<br />
Secure(SSL): No<br />
Socket Error: 10060<br />
<br />
I didn't change anything in the email app; I am using the same exact settings on my laptop (wireless to my router) and having success with outgoing email, but on another (wired) desktop machine the sends fail. At the same time this occurred I had some issues
 with file sharing as well.&nbsp; I solved them by unsharing and resharing the directories.<br />
<br />
I have tried changing ports, authentication, etc. to no avail.&nbsp; Again, the settings work on my laptop.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?&nbsp; <br />

            <div>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and has even been responsible
 for loss of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />

<h2>            Access from External Network to blocked port 80</h2>
                    I have blocked port 80 (inbound - firewall) on my Windows server 2008 R2. I want few users to access port 80 from external network. How can I do that? External network will have static public ip address.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 constantly crashing and running extremely slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthony_81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 constantly crashing and running extremely slow</h2>
                    As the title says, ive had trouble with Windows 10 recently. When i turned on my pc today, i noticed that Windows was extremely slow, and it kept freezing. It then froze completely, so had to force the shut down by pressing and holdong the off button.
 After that, i turned my pc back on and it took around 5-10 minutes to take me to the login screen. Once i log i notice that Windows was still running very slow and kept freezing. I then restarted, had to wait another 10 minutes, and after logging back in,
 i get this black screen, with my loading pointer only. I had to wait around 15 minutes to finally be able to access my desktop. Then, after so many restarts, Windows is still running extremely slow and constantly freezing. I have paid anti malware software,
 so i doubt that i may have a virus. What should i do?&nbsp;

            Hi,  Anthony
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<h2>            lost audio output from headphone jack following reset</h2>
                    I was having trouble with slow start-up and no start pages coming up when trying to get onto browsers. I did a reset and reinstalled Windows 10, the problems I was having were cured, but now my headphone jack isn't working.&nbsp; The speaker icon on the bottom
 toolbar has a red X next to it.&nbsp; The automatic troubleshooter either says "restart to fix problem" (which doesn't work) or "Troubleshooter couldn't identify problem". Neither my headphones nor my speakers (with remote 110v adapter) work from the jack. However,
 my wireless headphones with a USB adapter work just fine.

            This can mean the PC is not supported on Windows 10.  But I'd still try Windows 8.1, 8 or 7 Audio drivers, in that order.

<p>You have done a great job describing the procedure.<br />
<br />
However, the fact that this elaborate procedure even exists is a testament to Microsoft's total lack of competence.</p>
<p>What in their right mind made them make an OS that you can't connect to by simply running an .exe.<br />
<br />
Teamviewer doesn't NEED to be installed, it can be ''run'' as a one time thing.<br />
<br />
Why does Microsoft keep shooting itself in the foot is beyond me.<br />
Naturally, the company itself doesn't feel any of it.<br />
<br />
It's the users that get screwed over when you get into a problem like this, a problem that could have been avoided with a few changed lines of code..<br />
I'm not even mad that they made it that way.<br />
I'm more mad at the fact that they went out of their way to hide the remote assistance as best as they possibly could without literally just scrapping it altogether.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>MSI BUG in Windows 10&#63;&#58; PATH env var not updated by MSI after - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MSI BUG in Windows 10&#63;&#58; PATH env var not updated by MSI after s&#47;w install finishes until user log out&#47;in &#40;or reboot&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I'm seeing different behavior when installing a software package under Windows 10 versus under previous versions of Windows.&nbsp; The software package is installed via a Windows Installer (MSI) package that is invoked by a setup.exe bootstrapper application
 (which&nbsp;requires elevated privileges to run).&nbsp; The MSI package updates the %PATH% environment variable during installation (using the MSI Environment Table).&nbsp; The MSI package ONLY runs in the&nbsp;per-machine context so the environment variables for all users should
 be updated by the installation.&nbsp; However, that is not the case on Windows 10 (until after the user logs out and back in or reboots the system).<br />
<br />
MSI Behavior on Windows 8.1 or earlier:<br />
After the MSI installation completes, the %PATH% environment variable&nbsp;is properly updated for all users.&nbsp; This is evidenced by opening a non-elevated command window and running "echo %PATH%" to display the value of the %PATH% environment variable.&nbsp; Running
 the command in BOTH a non-elevated command window and in an elevated command window (context under which the MSI ran) shows the same results: in both cases the %PATH% environment variable was properly modified by the MSI installation.<br />
<br />
MSI Behavior on Windows 10 (build 10240):<br />
After the MSI installation completes, the %PATH% environment variable is only updated for the user who ran the installation (the elevated user credentials used to run setup.exe).&nbsp; If I open a non-elevated command window and examine the %PATH% environment variable
 it was NOT updated.&nbsp; However, if I then log out and log back in (or just reboot), then the %PATH% environment variable is properly set for all users (as seen in both a non-elevated command window and in an elevated command window).<br />
<br />
Is this a bug with MSI on Windows 10?</p>
