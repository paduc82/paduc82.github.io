<p>I was prompted to update my console, i did so and it got stuck at 74% for around two hours so i power cycled but it still gets stuck at 74.</p>

<p>UPDATE-- I factory reset my console but it's still stuck at 74%</p>

I'm in the preview program if that makes a difference</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 cannot see network, Network cannot see Windows 7</h2>
                    I've just recently upgraded my system, so I've had to reinstall my operating system. I've tried every damn solution I could find as my current issue makes 0% sense what so ever, I'll try lay it out as best as possible.  My computer system is in its own Homegroup (which may I add, can NEVER be seen by any other system on my network even before the upgrade), I  have media sharing enabled and every game console (even the PS3) can stream media off my PC with ease. No issues there at all. But when I goto My Computer  Network my PC cannot see any other PC on the network, and if done on a different PC, it cannot see my PC (but the other PC can see other PCs on the network).  I've tried everything I know to resolve this.  IP settings are all on the same network (I've set DHCP to set things, which I've double checked) Workgroup is the same (Although I changed it one my machine and a laptop to test it, and things started working but then my 360 couldn't see my PC, so I reverted) I've added my networ

            Both method 1 &amp; 2 is something I check as soon as an OS is installed in my household as it's an important thing for me since my PC stores all the important stuff for the family.
<br />
<br />
Also, I've figured it out after a good night sleep. I was randomly in my adapters settings and in the IPv4 part I clicked "Install" and chose "Protocol" and now everything works. Problem solved. =]<br />

<p>If you purchased the game via Games For Windows and redeemed the key on GfW, you can't activate a key on Steam, because you didn't buy it from Steam.&nbsp; You can of course add the game to your Steam library for easier access, but all this does is add a shortcut.&nbsp;
 You can't update the game via Steam.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Error&#58; Send failed with hr &#61; 80072ee280072EE2</h2>
                    I have encountered a very unusual situation. Windows Update works with one ISP but not another. Cable fails, but ADSL works.<br />
<br />
I think it's associated with the May 9 issue of 23 updates, which were presented and installed normally.&nbsp; But, since that time I've been receiving the error message when trying to check for updates with Windows Update.<br />
<br />
I have tested using 3 computers.&nbsp; Each computer is running Security Essentials, but the error still occurs if I disable Security Essentials.&nbsp; I also disabled the Windows Firewall and the error still occurred.&nbsp; None of the computers are set up to use a Proxy.
 TraceRt to Microsoft appears reasonable as far as not having packet loss or long pings. The problem occurs consistently from day to day, not a one of situation.<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; Two computers use Vista 32 Bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; One is a desktop with Vista Home Premium, and the other is a laptop with Vista Business.&nbsp; Both computers receive the Error 80072EE2 when I try to manually check for updates.<br />
<br />
Here is the unusual part:&nbsp; This problem only occurs using Comcast HSI.&nbsp; It does not occur using Frontier DSL.&nbsp; To clarify:&nbsp; If I separately connect the computers via a normal CAT5 cable directly to the Comcast Cable Modem, neither computer will successfully
 work with Windows Update.&nbsp; I am doing this one computer at a time, directly connecting to the cable modem with no routers etc involved.<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp; When I connect the two Vista 32 bit computers, individually, using a CAT5 cable directly from the computer to the ADSL Modem, both computers work with Windows Update and receive software downloads.<br />
<br />
3)&nbsp; The computer with 64 bit Windows 7 works fine on either ISP.&nbsp; When I directly connect that computer to the cable modem, it downloads updates from Windows Update with no error message.&nbsp; Same for the ADSL modem setup.<br />
<br />
I have done all the steps in the various troubleshooter articles from Microsoft and others without resolving this.&nbsp; But, since all the computers work with the ADSL setup, I would think the problem isn't in the client computer side.
<br />
<br />
I don't have any restore points, but could restore the system from an earlier image.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
From the Windows Update log it appears the connection to https://www.update.microsoft.com/v6/ClientWebService/client.asmx is failing.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

            The problem is exactly as described in the kb/836941 report you cited, except the problem doesn't go
<br />
<br />
away after waiting a while. <br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, I took the laptop to a library to see if windows update would work over WiFi.&nbsp; It
<br />
<br />
worked.<br />
<br />
So, the score so far, using the same laptop without any software changes:<br />
<br />
1) Laptop windows update works with telco DSL connection.<br />
2) Laptop windows update fails with cable Comcast connection.<br />
3) Laptop windows update works with library WiFi connection.<br />
<br />
It seems like this problem is specific to something internal to the cable network, not within the client laptop.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is part of DSL windows update log;&nbsp; NOTE: "Synchronizing is extended" message appears<br />

            <p>1. Have you or have you not completed the mutli-step possible fix in my previous post?</p>
<p>2. Have you ever installed any Frontier and/or Comcast software on the computer-in-question?</p>
<p>3. Is the Frontier-supplied modem also a wireless router?</p>
<p>4. If you're using a Comcast-supplied modem, is it also a wireless router?</p>
<p>5. Does the computer-in-question connect via a router (wireless or otherwise) that belongs to
<em>you?</em></p>
<p>Note: According to your&nbsp;second post above,&nbsp;it would appear that Automatic Updates is (or at least was)&nbsp;still working&nbsp;as&nbsp;recently as 09 May-12&nbsp;&amp; keeping your computer fully-patched.</p>

            1 Yes I did all the steps recommended in your previous post.<br />
2. No, never have installed their software.<br />
3. No, it is a simple modem with no router.<br />
4. No, connected directly to arris cable modem, no router.<br />
5. Normally I use routers, but for these tests I dropped the router to make sure that wasn't the issue.<br />
6.Yes, that's what I first mentioned.&nbsp; The problem seemed to start after the 23 updates came through on May 9.<br />

Well, I'm totally stumped here as the multi-step fix <em>should have </em>fixed this very strange problem. Then again, it might have been too late for the Norton &amp; McAfee removal tools to&nbsp;"come to the rescue" here&nbsp;- and if that's the case, only a clean install
 of Vista will fix this.</p>
<p>Since this issue only occurs on the Vista computers and only when they connect via Comcast, perhaps you'd be better off posting in the Networking forum for further assistance:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-networking">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-networking</a>&nbsp;[1]</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>While the next round of security updates are scheduled to be released on 12 June 2012, Microsoft
<em>may be releasing </em>non-security updates on 22 May (i.e., this coming Tuesday). If the computers are connected via Comcast &amp; Automatic Updates installs those updates (if any), it would appear that Automatic Updates is still working anyway.</p>
<p>MSE autoupdates itself via the Windows Update tunnel but technically not via Automatic Updates. If MSE continues to autoupdate while the computers are connected via Comcast, well, that just adds to the mystery here.</p>
<p>Good luck!&nbsp; If I think of anything else, I'll post another reply to this thread.</p>
<p>======================================================<br />
[1] Just for giggles, you might contact Comcast Support about this, too. Certainly can't hurt.</p>

<h2>            How to hide updates in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: windows 10 updates</p>
<p>Hi </p>
<p>Whilst I agree that its a lot simpler for Windows to have auto updates this leads to an issue with my older machine.</p>
<p>With windows7 you could hide updates you didn't want, or those that caused problems. My question is simple, how in windows 10 do I do this ? I cannot find anyway to stop an update being listed/ installed.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should..</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Updates and drivers are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific driver or update might temporarily
 cause issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic driver or update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow the below link to know how to hide the update in Windows 10:</p>

<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
When I receive outlook event invitations, they show up in windows live mail as code. &nbsp;When I open outlook, they show up fine and I can add them to my outlook calendar, but not my windows live calendar.</p>

To best address this issue, please provide the following information:<br />
<ul>

<p><span>To&nbsp;upload a screen shot of the error, this will take a few minutes to do, and it requires extra steps

            I give up. &nbsp;I'm not uploading anything more. &nbsp;I'm not answering any more questions. &nbsp;I will go back to using Outlook and gmail separately. &nbsp;Windows Live mail and Outlook are both microsoft programs. &nbsp;The fact that they can't talk to each other is ridiculous.
 &nbsp;FIX THIS!!

 mess (see below); sometimes i can go through them and figure out the details and sometimes i can't.&nbsp; I am not using outlook directly but&nbsp;forwarding the event invite message&nbsp;to an outlook client (different acct), does no good at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;i tried to de-identify
 the text below by xing out names, phones and other into but i didnt delete anything.&nbsp; By the way, there's a limit of 3000 chars here but no way of knowing that there is a limit or how many characters you have left!!&nbsp; i had to delete parts of the text below!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks!&nbsp; JL/SATX&nbsp; <br />

            Hi LISACHRISTMAN, this is a common enough error, that dll is part of the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013
<br />
<br />You should go to Control Panel - Programs and Features and uninstall the version you have, then click the link below, download and install both the 32bit and 64bit version. Then restart your system - that's it!

                    <b>Using Fresh Paint: I</b> <b>like drawing a self-portrait with the tablet in the vertical position<br />
(called "portrait" I think),but when it is moved into any save or stored or emailed,it's<br />
in horizontal because that's the usual way to use the tablet.<br />
<br />
I have not found the way to rotate the drawing, the image, 90 degrees to the right<br />
(or rotate it at all).&nbsp; HELP,&nbsp; please.&nbsp; Can you tell me how to rotate a drawing done<br />
vertically but uploaded on its side?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Sanda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you will not be able to rotate the drawing within Fresh Paint. Alternatively, you may try to follow these steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Save the paint to your desired location.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open <b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/search-file-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">File Explorer</a></b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to the location where you have saved the paint.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Right click or press and hold</b> on the paint file. You will see the options
<b>Rotate right</b> and <b>Rotate left</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Choose any one option to rotate the picture as per your requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Vista Critical Downloads Not Happening</h2>
                    I've been trying for days and many wasted hours trying to get the September 2016 Critical Updates for my Vista 32-bit computer. All it says is "Checking for updates..."&nbsp; That has been happening for hours since the 13th. What is wrong and why hasn't anything
 been done to fix this never ending problem? I am 80 years old and can't continue to keep my Vista laptop running for hours to try and get these Critical Updates every month with no solution. What is wrong and why aren't the Critical Updates downloading? I
 am just about to give up because of so much wasted time. Can someone PLEASE offer a solution! This has been going on for months!

<p>

<p>
</p><p>#1---save the file and double-clicked on it</p>
<p>#2 -- use "run" from the dialog box</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both case, I get Windows Standalone Installer and a dialog box stating "searching for updates"</p>

</p><p>Nothing seems to happen and this dialog box has been open for quite some time now.</p>

</p><p>However--what should be my next steps to get all the updates I think are out there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my setup now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>wuauserv is "stopped"</p>
<p>"Never check for updates" is checked</p>
<p>
</p><p>When would I be able to start "wuauserv" and "auto check for updates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this going to happen every month from now one for W/Vista??</p>
        </p>

            <p>I have no idea what you are talking about. As I mentioned, I am 80 years old and know nothing about computers and cannot possibly understand. What you have supplied is completely confusing to me as a novice.</p>
<p>No one can even supply the KB numbers of the actual Critical Updates for Vista 32 for Sept. 2016. Every place I look shows different KB numbers and so no one know which ones are the correct ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are other people posting their questions on my thread? I am having trouble who is answering my question or who is asking a question. Shouldn't they start their own thread?</p>

            <p>I did install the KB3185911 and then when I checked for updates, it still continues to say "Checking for Updates." How long is that supposed to take?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add-on: After about 15 minutes, the screen said I now had updates. I allowed them to install and now show 7 updates installed successfully. I guess that KB318911 was the solution, but don't know what will happen next month. It seems to be a never ending
 story with MS and critical updates. I think they are paying too much attention to Win 10 and ignoring Win 7 and Vista.
<strong>Thanks </strong>for the suggestion about the KB318511. First bit of useful information I received over the past few days. I wasted many, many hours trying to get these downloads as I am sure others have also.<br />
</p>
<p>BTW: Are you 'connected' to MS or will anyone from MS read these posts and possibly correct the download problem?</p>

            <p>You are correct, Microsoft is not supporting Windows Vista, Windows7, Windows 8/8.1 as they should be. For those that paid "Retail" for these O/S (Operating Systems) my heart goes out to you.&nbsp; I only purchase OEM (Original Manufactures Equipment) related
 software from Microsoft.&nbsp; This means that there isn't any technical support offered. Since I have a CIS degree/ A+ Cert. and build my own systems, I do not rely on Microsoft's shabby technical support staff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered a page on Microsoft's website, where you are able to download&nbsp; and install the security updates from 2006 to the present.&nbsp; This includes Windows Updates for Windows XP Through Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I know that Microsoft purposely break links that people provide in these forums, I have no problem sending you the link in an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's theory is, if you are unable to find support for your current operating system, then you no other choice but to upgrade. In my book, that is nothing but a bunch of bull.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another practice everyone should follow, creating a "System Image". Back on 10/2015, I reformatted my hard drive(s) and performed a clean install of Windows Vista, 7, and 8.1.&nbsp; Plus made sure that nasty KB3035583 update did not download and install.
 If you recall, that update would set up your computer to download and install Windows 10.&nbsp; Once I have updated the drivers, programs/software and Windows Security Updates and Patches, I perform a system image. There are programs out on the web that are free
 for the "End Users".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I&nbsp; contract a computer virus, instead of playing around trying to rid of it, I just wipe my hard drive clean, and apply my system image and I am ready to go. Plus, Windows Updates works as it should.&nbsp; It appears that Microsoft has taken the feature
 "Updates on Demand" away. This was when you were able to see what updates were available before downloading and installing.&nbsp; The feature is still available, it just doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am opened to any questions you may have. </p>

<h3> chuckrenner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Libraries &#40;Music&#47;Videos&#47;Pictures&#47;etc.&#41; are not populating in Windows Media Player &#40;WMP&#41; and Windows Media Center &#40;WMC&#41;. How do I fix this user-specific problem&#63;</h2>
                    I've been Googling this particular problems for weeks with no luck. &nbsp;All the similar articles I have found for this problem are usually from 2009, and yet none of them show any consistent resolution!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem in a nutshell:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>On my Windows user account, Windows Media Player (WMP), Windows Media Player Network Streaming Service (WMP NSS), and Windows Media Center (WMC) will not populate my media files into their corresponding libraries.</li><li>The folders that are in the libraries are populated with media files, and I can "double-click" any media file to open it manually in WMP and play it.</li><li>Even though there are many media files in the folders that make up the libraries, WMP, WMP NSS, and WMC do not "see them"</li><li>Older versions of WMP allowed you to "import" media, and manually "refresh" if the media folders had more up-to-date content than what was showing in WMP.</li><li>Uninstalling WMP, WMP NSS, and WMC, rebooting, cleaning up settings, and reinstalling WMP, WMP NSS, and WMC did not solve anything.</li></ul>
<div><b>Here's what's really annoying. &nbsp;I am 100% certain that the problem is user specific (to my Windows account).</b> To verify this, I created a new user account called "Temp" and I logged into the PC as "Temp" (using Fast User Switching). &nbsp;I launched WMP,
 and it immediately starting populating the libraries in WMP. &nbsp;When I added new media to the explorer folders (that make up the libraries), it appeared in WMP with no user intervention.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I contacted HP for help (this PC is only about 3 weeks old). &nbsp;They wanted me to re-image/recover my entire PC. &nbsp;I basically told the tech he was an idiot? &nbsp;Why would I re-image my entire PC for a user specific issue. &nbsp;I&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;thought of two workarounds
 (that work because the problem is user specific), and shared them with him. &nbsp;He still suggested re-imaging the PC. &nbsp;Idiot. &nbsp;Here are the two workarounds I could do:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Windows user account called "Media". &nbsp;Move all of my media into the "Media" account, and setup WMP, WMP NSS, and WMC (which would allow me to stream from DLNA/UPnP devices on my network). &nbsp;The only drawback is that some of the content is DRM
 protected, and I might have license issues. &nbsp;I HATE, HATE, HATE DRM (but that is an issue for another day).</li><li>Abandon my Windows user account (and rename it something like "OldChuck"), create a new Windows user account (like "Chuck") and start migrating all my files documents and settings manually. I believe the problem was introduced during migration (Windows
 "Easy" Transfer Wizard) from an old Windows XP netbook, so I wouldn't do the Windows Easy Transfer Wizard again (in this case). &nbsp;Drawbacks include having to reconfigure all my settings for all of my apps, and the same licensing/DRM issues. &nbsp;Did I mention that
 the only thing that DRM is good for is locking paying consumers out of their own, PAID, legitimate media? Sorry. &nbsp;Went off track again.</li></ol>
<div><b>Can some WMP/WMP NSS guru PLEASE tell me how to do the following:</b></div>
</div>
<div><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. &nbsp;Force WMP to populate its libraries from the corresponding folders (with media in them)?</b></div>
<div><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. &nbsp;"Import" media into WMP when it's being stubborn. OR</b></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><b>A good, clean way to "reset" my "Libraries" for my Windows User account, and&nbsp;</b></li><li><b>a consistent method to make WMP automatically update it's libraries based on available content.</b></li></ol>
</div>
<div>Honestly, I wouldn't even care about WMP (it is just about the worst Media Player ever), except for being able to use WMP NSS from various DLNA/UPnP devices (Blu-Ray Devices). &nbsp;The only time I use "brand-name" media players is when I'm playing DRM protected
 content (iTunes Movies, UltraViolet Movies, etc.).</div>
<div>The same library problem seems to carry over to other Media Servers (not just WMP NSS). &nbsp;MediaMall's PlayOn and PlayLater are not showing media in their library folders when browsing from the network. &nbsp;Even XBMC isn't serving files from this account over
 the network.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So basically, I can't stream my media to my network devices because something is screwed up with the Windows Media Libraries.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HELP!!! PLEASE!!!</div>

<div><b>Unfortunately, this erased my libraries (the little content that was showing in them), and hours later on an idle computer, the libraries are still empty.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>I have figured out that specifically in Windows 7, the Windows "Indexing Options" are related to the libraries, so I let Windows rebuild the entire index, but the libraries are still blank.</div>

            OK. &nbsp;I'm making progress.
<div><br />
<div>Here are the steps that I have done.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li><b>WMP </b>-&gt; <b>Tools</b> Menu -&gt; <b>Advanced</b> -&gt; <b>Restore media library...</b></li><li><b>Explorer</b> -&gt; <b>Libraries </b>-&gt; <b>Context Menu</b> (Right Click) &nbsp;for each library -&gt;
<b>Restore Defaults</b></li><li><b>Start </b>-&gt; <b>Settings </b>-&gt; <b>Control Panel</b> -&gt; <b>Indexing Settings</b>. &nbsp;Make sure all folders for all libraries are marked to be indexed. &nbsp;Let Windows build index while computer is idle.</li><li>If libraries in WMP still don't show media, then <b>WMP </b>-&gt; <b>Tools Menu</b> -&gt;
<b>Advanced </b>-&gt; <b>Restore deleted items...</b></li><li>If libraries in WMP still don't show files, select a library in the <b>WMP Navigation Panel</b> (the library, not any folders or items in the library) drag media files into the
<b>WMP Main Panel</b>. &nbsp;It doesn't seem to matter which library is selected in the
<b>Navigation Panel</b>, as long as one of the (local) libraries is selected.</li><li>Do <b>NOT </b>drag folders into the library, only media files. Dragging folders will add those folders to the ones that are supposed to be automatically added to the library, but this does not force WMP to add the files in those folders.</li></ol>
<div>On my user account, this seems to build the library for the files I drag and drop into WMP (but only if the Windows indexing is already done).</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I figure out how to get it build automatically (like it does for other users on my PC), then I'll post the working methods here.</div>

1) Amen.
<div><br />
<div>2) My libraries (media and documents) are working correctly in Windows Explorer. &nbsp;If, in Explorer, I attempt to open the local WMP NSS device, it opens WMP, where my libraries are empty.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) No. This PC is three weeks old. &nbsp;Also the problem only happens in my user account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4) Yes, but it does not add media (music) in those folders to my WMP libraries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5.1) My Music, My Pictures, and My Videos are listed in this registry folder. &nbsp;My TV Recordings (which would be in HKLM instead of HKCU since it's not user specific).</div>
<div><br />
<div>5.2) The same as 5.1 in this case.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6.1) I just tried it. Should there be any progress noticeable? My libraries show no media in WMP again? &nbsp;Should I shutdown these two services before deleting (with WMP closed), and start them up again after these files are deleted: WSearch (Windows Search
 indexing) and WMPNetworkSvc (WMP NSS)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>6.2) I just tried it. &nbsp;Same as 6.1, should there be any noticeable progress, and should I shut down WSearch and WMPNetworkSvc before deleting these files/folders?</div>

 (be it SEP 12 MP9 ot SEP 14, this error will pop up every few seconds). Thanks to you in advance, :)</p>

            Hi,
<br />I am not sure if it is legit or a leftover of a malware. let us do both of those.
<br />Please remove Symantec first:
<br /><a href="https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.HOWTO74877.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.HOWT...</a>
<br />then run Malwarebytes:
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />Reinstall Symantec and see if the issue persists.
<br />Disclaimer:

            1. Remove Symantec completely from your system.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Symantec Endpoint Protection - <a href="https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.TECH184988.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.TECH...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Now, if Symantec was installed, then install it again. And run the scan from Symantec End Point again.
<br />
<br />3. You should run malware scan
<br />Malware Bytes - <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />
<br />4. Use Defender Scan (If Symantec End Point was not installed)
<br />Open Windows Defender &gt; Virus &amp; threat protection menu &gt; Advanced Scan &gt; Full Scan

            Hi NgLouis, don't worry you are not infected, this is very common
<br />
<br />Symantec Endpoint, or any Norton product never uninstalls cleanly, use the page below to remove all remnants of that installation . . .

<h2>            I need the microsoft Epson LX Series1 &#40;80&#41; printer driver. My printer driver list was updated, and the option was removed.</h2>
                    <p>I am installing a new PC. The Epson LX Series1 (80) driver was available on my "Add Printer" list, but while searching for the correct USB port that my printer was connected to, I mistakenly clicked on the "Windows Update" button, and when the update was
 completed, the only Epson LX option available to use was the 300 series. The Epson site has no help for the newer versions of windows. I do have the driver on another PC, so if possible, maybe I can copy it to a flash drive and install on my new PC that way.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div><br />
1. What is the exact model number of the Epson printer?<br />
Please refer,</div>
<div><a href="http://www.epson.co.uk/gb/en/viewcon/corporatesite/products/mainunits/faq/1864/3394#toc6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.epson.co.uk/gb/en/viewcon/corporatesite/products/mainunits/faq/1864/3394#toc6</a><br />
<div>2. Which version of Windows are you running?</div>
<div>Example: Windows 7 Professional 32 Bit.</div>
<div>If you have an older version of the driver, then you may try installing the drivers in compatibility mode or in XP Mode.</div>
<div><br />
If there is no current driver version available to download off the Epson website, you may have to contact Epson support regarding the same, and request a driver for your operating system.</div>
<div><br />
The best possible option that you may try is to run a system restore to a prior date to the update that you installed and check if it helps. However if the driver option were to search online and download externally then you would be in the same loop.<br />
<div>Hope this helps.<br />

            After a full day of trying various recommended fixes, this post seems to have solved the problem (same issue - 9 Critical updates, stopping at 15% during the configuration step).&nbsp; The first two options in this post did not find anything or solve the problem,
 the clean boot appears to have resolved the issue.&nbsp; I also disabled my Norton 360 Antivirus protection as the most recent updates of this software seem to have made my system a bit less stable. (Win 7 Pro)<br />

<h2>            Trying to set a different &#39;view&#39; for each folder in Windows Explorer -- I have Window 7</h2>
                    I have Windows 7.&nbsp; I'm trying to set each folder in Windows Explorer to a specific view (e.g. 'List', 'Large Icons', 'Details', etc.), and I want that view to apply to that one folder only, and I want that folder to display in that selected view every
 time I access it.&nbsp; And I want to be able to set different views for different folders.&nbsp; But whenever I change the view in any given folder, it keeps that view for every folder I open.<br />
<br />
I have clicked 'Tools' and then 'Folder Options', but I can't see anything that helps.<br />
<br />
How do I set different views for each individual folder?<br />
<br />
THANKS much!

I'm an idiot lol.&nbsp; I just realized I had mistakenly copied my entire "My Documents" folder into&nbsp;the 'Documents' Library, instead of just copying a&nbsp;shortcut into my&nbsp;"Favorites" (which is what I had intended to do).&nbsp; And I&nbsp;had been trying to modify all my folders
 by accessing them through the Library instead of&nbsp;via the original location&nbsp;within "My Documents".&nbsp; And the Library does not allow you to change the View of each specific folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why the&nbsp; "Apply to Folders" and "Reset Folders" buttons were shaded and
 wouldn't allow me to push them, because&nbsp;I was in the Library.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's all good now.&nbsp; Now that I'm accessing the files from their original location in "My Documents", it is letting me change the View of each individual folder.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your help.&nbsp; Without you walking me through those steps, I wouldn't have stumbled upon the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!!<br />

    <title>What is the difference between these USB Host Controllers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank3si  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the difference between these USB Host Controllers&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Over the last week I have been configuring a semi-recent Dell PC for use with audio recording. I have a Lexicon Omega audio interface that connects to the PC via USB, so I went into the Dell's Device Manager to scope out the USB situtation. This PC looks
 like so:<br />
<br />
Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller<br />
USB Root Hub (top two rear USB ports, bottom front single USB port)<br />
<br />
Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller<br />
USB Root Hub (bottom two rear USB ports, top front single USB port)<br />
<br />
For audio in/out, I know that having&nbsp;dedicated USB&nbsp;controller for that task alone is preferable to having many USB devices connected and sharing the resources. I just bought a USB 7-port hub, so I can connect the mouse, keyboard,&nbsp;and so on to one port going
 to one USB Root Hub, while I use the Lexicon Omega attached to a port associated with the other USB Root Hub.<br />
<br />
The question is, what is the difference between the two controllers listed above the two USB Root Hubs, and which one would best handle the audio in/out for recording and playback use?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice!</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Frank3si</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>USB2 is enhanced and the other is USB1.</strong></p>
<p>The difference between front and back ports is that the front ports interface with USB 1.1 devices and transfer data to the back ports.</p>
<p>If you have an&nbsp;enhanced USB Host Controller then you have High Speed USB (USB 2.0)&nbsp;</p>

I pre-ordered my X earlier this month from my locale EB Games store in the CBD. They txt me this afternoon and said EB Games stores throughout NZ will be open from 10:30pm tonight for the Xbox One X Launch Party. (I also went to Sydney NYE fireworks December 2016 leading into NY 2017 and Sydney has the best fireworks NYE display in the world!). I confirmed by ringing them when I got a friendly confirmation from this chick who answered the phone (salesperson from the store)

            <p>O yeah It's Monday 6 November 6:18 pm NZT for me. Definitely going to that midnight launch party which starts at 10:30 pm tonight but may arrive at the store a bit after 11pm tonight. Good time too since summer for NZ/Australia is December - February and we have our long summer holidays (people at work, and schools which finish up early to mid December for the summer break). It will be like the only retailer open in the CBD late tonight. Night life. Well EB Games and Microsoft are American so it's great to have this event in NZ. Perhaps EB Games stores in Australia are doing it?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

Too late for me and the school holidays aren't on yet even though seniors have study leave. I'll get mine after school and get my bf to help set it out cause I know my brother won't help. If my bro breaks it or hassles me when I'm on it, he'll get grounded with no electronics for .... days. My dad knows I deserve it :II</p>

It will be still November 6 in the UK and US by the time he puts up his photo with it anyways, unless these people cheat and receive it before their November 7.

Now I have to set it up, record more screenshots and videos and post to YouTube. I've shared one photo to facebook. It would be great if Microsoft acquired Facebook. They have tried.... but those people are stubborn.

            <p>Hello. Back again. I've connected wi fi to my secure home network (wireless). Just downloading something like a 700MB approximately Update for Xbox One. Few! Everyone will get this update. And we can thankfully it's NOT the combination of all Xbox One updates because if you add those MB all up it would be a whole lot more than just 700MB. The console took like 60 seconds to boot up, not too bad. But it's the initial setup I'm going through right now. Wonder if Microsoft will release the super duper graphics pack for Minecraft today. Still be transferring my most important games throughout this afternoon. </p><p><br /></p><p>Important games: </p><p>Final Fantasy XV (disc), Minecraft (digital), Infinite minigolf (digital), rocket league (digital), FH3 (digital), Screamride (disc), Zoo Tycoon (digital).&nbsp; &lt;---- These games I can do this afternoon. I will also install Netflix and YouTube. I wonder if Microsoft has a Facebook app too and if it's available in Australasia or Oceania or Australi

            <p>Also to let everyone know, you will need to manually update the store separately. As the initial set up's System Update does not include it. </p><p><br /></p><p>The store Update, when you first use it on the X, is 140MB big roughly. Also when you get the X, only 780GB of the internal 1TB or 1000GB or 100,000MB however you put, is useable. I also have a Seagate Slim 1TB HDD which has a 3 year warranty from Seagate XD. </p><p><br /></p><p>IMPORTANT. Once you have applied the Store Update to your X (only takes a minute), the UI/Dashboard will show you your entire Xbox One games library on the left "Ready To Install". Thank you Microsoft for this feature. Be back with an update soon. </p>
