<h2>            Microsoft Launcher&#47;Windows 10 April Update has created incessant notification sound</h2>
                    <p>Ran the Windows 10 Update yesterday and followed the instructions on the screen to get the Microsoft Launcher app on my phone (android) in order to take advantage of the new features.&nbsp; Immediately after that my phone started making an unknown notification
 chime every few minutes.&nbsp; The only time when the notification sound on my phone stops is when I turn my newly updated laptop off which leads me to believe that the laptop is trying to access or communicate with the phone.&nbsp; I've since uninstalled Microsoft
 Launcher but still the notification sound persists.&nbsp; I've gone through every app and every setting imaginable on the phone to turn off notifications.&nbsp; Also have powered down the phone several times.&nbsp; It's definitely related to my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft to get some help but they say that I should go to the manufacturer of the phone and of course, I'm sure that the people at the phone store will send me back to the computer since the problem goes away when I turn the computer off.</p>

            Hi Helen. Even though you stated you have uninstalled the launcher I would see this link to make sure your phone is reset to use the default launcher<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/reset-your-android-phone-to-the-default-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/reset-your-android-...</a><br /><br /> Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

            Thank you so much Dadof5.&nbsp; I did follow that exact procedure but it hasn't stopped the notification chimes.&nbsp; One thing that I haven't done since it is to shut the computer down so I'm going to do that now.

<p>Shoot, I turned off my computer and enjoyed an hour of blessed silence, turned the computer again and the chiming notification sound started right back up coming at aprox every 90 seconds.&nbsp; It looks like my only option at this point might be a factory reset
 and time spent installing every single app again.&nbsp; But even then, why would the chiming stop since it's clearly coming from my laptop?</p>

<h2>            Managing of user profiles in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 8.1 yesterday and these are the interesting things that happened. My (bad) User account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** disappeared from view on my PC tree (under Users). It remains under Manage Accounts. A new User Account named 'Abby' appeared in its place
 under Users. I deleted all files (not folders) under this account as they were in most cases duplicates of what is under the 'good' User Account: abbyl_000, which is associated with my 'good' sky account,&nbsp;&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** .&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** remains as a Sky account.
 In my 'good' @outlook.com account, the 'other' email account of &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** has disappeared. I still seem to be getting all email and haven't lost anything and nothing else seems wrong except that: I have info regarding purchases I have made from Microsoft
 sitting in the old, 'bad, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account in the sky. In one case, which my bank is exploring, I have been charged $239 twice for MS Office 2013.&nbsp; And today I had to deal with $10 charged for my discontinued Office 365 which was in the 'bad' account in the
 sky. I can't wait to get rid of User 'Abby' (formerly *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and Microsoft sky account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. It may be that only Jack Cook can translate this post because he is the one who helped me out of the original 'bad' account creation.</p>

<h2>            surface forces reboot every 15 minutes</h2>
                    <p>The latest updates forced 2 restarts before they considered installation complete. Now my PC tells me it will force reboot in 15 minutes *every time it boots*. So, my PC is a brick right now. Help. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi, John.</p>
<p>I have shut down manually a few times and it's still happening. The pc was up to date when this started. It seems to take an inordinately long time to boot up. I could be just bored with how many times I see it, but it seems to be longer. Like, leave the
 room and go do something else longer.&nbsp;This might be related to the updates that were pulled and it will self-correct when an&nbsp;improved&nbsp;update is pushed, but in the meantime, should I manually remove the updates I received?</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, Regan_L.</p>
<p>Yes, per prior response I've done what the TS suggests.</p>
<p>To quote:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Q: I keep getting prompted to restart my PC to finish installing updates.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">A: Some updates apply to files or services that Windows is using, so these updates can't be installed while Windows is running. You should save your work, close any open apps, and then restart your PC to finish the update process.</p>
<p>This is not my problem. My Surface has been rebooted about 50 times already. I get no prompt WRT finishing updates. My problem is that it boots without any "updating your computer" modal prompt as it does. It boots without announcing any difficulty or delay,
 but is stuck in an infinite loop of forced reboot.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            I hard reset the Surface RT, and everything was glorious for a few days. Then Patch Tuesday rolled around and I was pushed a different problem. Now, instead of just freezing the modern IE app, which happened with great frequency already, the entire OS
 freezes. So, I'm back to power cycling, but not every 15 minutes.

</p><p>Thank you for your response. I am sorry to hear that hard resetting the device only worked for a few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>To clarify, has your initial problem of the device force rebooting been resolved after the hard reset?</li><li>Does the entire OS freeze completely randomly, or are you on a certain app/program when it happens?</li><li>When the OS freezes, what do you do get it to start working again?</li></ul>

<h2>            My Bluetooth headphones are at very low volume</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looking for some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Bluetooth headphones are now at very low volume, even when at 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add some more detail</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are Sony Wf1000x</p>
<p>When connected there are two devices listed</p>
<ul>
<li>WF-1000x Stereo</li><li>WF-1000x Hands-free</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When I set the default to the stereo the volume is very low, when I set it Hands-free the volume is correct, but only from the left speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached the headphone to the phone and the work perfectly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has only arisen in the last few weeks, for the previous 2 months I had no issue, nor for the previous six months before when I had a different laptop on windows7, instead of my current Windows10 one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that the drivers are all up to date, as well as windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have unpaired, removed/replaced the drivers, uninstalled the device.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>All to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be great;y appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<br /> Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menu at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page.  While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>Hey Den1CW7,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that the games are not very compatible with Windows 7. Follow these steps to determine the root cause of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Change the compatibility setting.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the games in XP SP2 compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Make older programs run in this
 version of Windows</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Change hardware acceleration.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To determine whether there is an issue with the video adapter or with the video driver, reduce the graphics hardware acceleration setting. To do
 this, follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the desktop, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Settings</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Move the
<strong>Hardware Acceleration</strong> slider to the left. The <strong>Hardware Acceleration</strong> setting should not be reduced to less than three notches from the right side. The
<strong>Hardware Acceleration</strong> setting should be the following: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable all cursor and advanced drawing accelerations. Use this setting to correct drawing problems</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you reduce the
<strong>Hardware Acceleration</strong> setting, you may experience more issues with video rendering.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong> two times.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> If reducing hardware acceleration
 resolves the problem, you may have to update your video card drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Update video card driver.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the driver for your graphics card that is released for Windows 7 from the manufacturer’s website. You can find this mostly in the support
 section of the website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this link for help with driver updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update drivers: recommended links</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Download the latest patch.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Most of the bugs and known issues are fixed in the new patch. See if this helps in your case.</span></p>

            Hi Antoina.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If Chrome won't open, then uninstall it in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, restart PC and then reinstall from a fresh download here:  <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a>
<br />
<br />Set it as default browser at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps. 
<br />
<br />I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser.  Set the preferred one as Default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having issue with bluetooth on my Windows 8.1. I just can't find it, it should be in pc settings&gt;pc&amp;devices but it's not.
<br />
Tried to restart service also, nothing. I'm using Acer Aspire 5755G. Need help.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
Marko<br />

I read the forum about this same issue in Windows Vista, but running the SFC /Scannow command didn't do the trick.<br />

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
I struggled to find a solution to this issue on my Windows 7 x64 Enterprise, but then Peter's reply prompted me to try 3 different freeware softwares: ContextEdit, ShellExView, and ShellMenuView.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, none of these tools helped my case.<br />
But I suspected a program "Memeo LifeAgent" backup software (which came with Seagate USB drive) and found the context menu handler in the registry, exported it for backup, and deleted the key.<br />
<br />
This solved my issue of: unable to launch a program using run as different user (or Administrator).<br />
<br />
I hope this writeup helps someone out there save 4 hours of his/her time. :)<br />

    <title>Saints Row 3 Season Pass Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richi immortal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saints Row 3 Season Pass Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo, ich bin's mal wieder!</p>
<p>Es reicht nicht, das mein guter Halo: Reach Spielstand verschwindet, nein, jetzt kann ich auch meinen frisch gekauften Season Pass (vor ca. 10 Minuten erstanden) nicht nutzen. Habe den -50 %-Abverkauf von THQ wahrgenommen, und um 800 MS-Points den Season
 Pass gekauft. Erst wunderte ich mich, dass die Doqnload-Anzeige innerhalb von 10 Sek. von 1 % auf 100 % sprang, na gut. Ich starte das Spiel, wähle als Speicherort Festplatte aus und klicke auf "Inhalte zum Herunterladen". Nach 15 sekündiger Suche sagt er
 folgendes: "Warnung: Herunterladbare Inhalte sind derzeit nicht verfügbar." Ja, wie soll ich den jetzt darauf zugreifen? Gut, dachte ich mir, vllt. mal online Code aktivieren. Schnell auf die Rückseite der Anleitung geschaut, Code eingetippt, Fehlermeldung.
 Wenn ich den Code schon eingegeben haben sollte, müsste ich ja online gehen können, oder? Nach mehrmaliger, penibelst genauer Überprüfung der Zahlen gab ich schließlich auf. Xbox aus und wieder an, hat nichts gebracht. Was tun?</p>

            <p>Welche Version des Spiels nutzt du? Die PEGI- oder die USK-Fassung?</p>
<p>Möglicherweise ist das das Problem (Kompatibilität). Habe das Spiel nicht, kann es dir daher nicht zu 100% sagen.</p>
<p>Der Season-Pass an sich ist nur ein paar KB groß, deshalb wird der Download so schnell abgeschlossen.</p>
<p>In deinem Downloadverlauf kannst du alle Inhalte erneut herunterladen. Versuche den Pass zu löschen und ihn per Verlauf erneut zu laden.</p>

<p>Hallo! </p>
<p>Ich nutze die USK-Fassung (Saints Row 3: BRD), da es sie mal bei Amazon.de im Abverkauf gab. (Bin Österreicher).
</p>
<p>Auf "erneut herunterladen" habe ich schon geklickt. Hat nichts gebracht. Da es keine Rückerstattung gibt, sind meine 10 Euro jetzt im Ar..., äh verloren, oder wie?

<p>Du bist Österreicher?</p>
<p>Dann benutzt du wohl den Ösi- Marktplatz und hast dementsprechend die PEGI Versionen auf dem Marktplatz und die gehen mit der USK Version nicht.</p>
<p>Also ist es nicht möglich den Deutschen Season Pass mit nem ÖSi Account zu aktivieren.</p>

<p>doch. gears funzt. das spiel ist weltweit inhaltsgleich. bei saints row erscheinen ja dann 2 verschiedene spiele im profil, SR3 und SR3: BRD. das sind zwei völlig unabhängige spiele. wie wenn du jetzt den gears 3 season pass eingelöst hättest, um SR3 online
 zu spielen. das wird auch nichts^^</p>

Try those three things, in that order, rebooting in-between (pretty sure right-clicking still works when the start button does not.)

 about a year and this error is somewhat new, post public release in July 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it's video related (NVidia 8400gs) or related to a SATA drive; just my gut.&nbsp; Feeling very much like a nube. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run the Windows Verifier which bricked my PC. I had to restore it from the recue DVD and HD backup I had made.</p>

            <p>I would see if there are any updates for your capture card, the drivers for it are 4 yrs old</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a few old drivers on your hdd. ntk_dtv_64.sys is dated 2009, I think this belongs to the capture app or a TV app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OpenHardwareMonitor.sys is from 2008 it belongs to a monitoring program. i8042HDR.sys is from 2006. This belongs to something from Chicony.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a preview version of Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats the specs of this system windows is on?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the response.&nbsp; In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Preview Version 14371</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) It's a home build older box, ASUS mobo, so the Bios is old as well (8 years!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 5000+, 2612 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 2 Logical Processor(s)<br />
BIOS Version/Date&nbsp;American Megatrends Inc. 0602, 10/29/2008</p>
<p>Hyper-V - VM Monitor Mode Extensions&nbsp;Yes<br />
Hyper-V - Second Level Address Translation Extensions&nbsp;No<br />
Hyper-V - Virtualization Enabled in Firmware&nbsp;Yes<br />
Hyper-V - Data Execution Protection&nbsp;Yes<br />
</p>
<p>I can go to the NVidia web site and grab the latest; but in my experience not all of the sub-system drivers are updated. Often it's the GEForce Experience that gets the bigger updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can uninstall the older Video Capture software, or at least disable it and the drivers from loading. Uninstall Roxio, Motion Man, Open Hardware etc. Get back to a more base version. I'll probably uninstall 1 item at a time to see if it BSOD's, which is
 pretty much every 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In my heart of hearts I've been convinced&nbsp;it's a Hard Drive or Video issue. I Binged "<strong>nvstor.sys"
</strong>and ran across a boatload of hits regarding BSOD and this driver. So I've downloaded the latest &amp; greatest GEForce Full Install exe and&nbsp;chose 'fresh install' to ensure all the older drivers are overwritten.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I&nbsp;see&nbsp; the time/date stamp for nvstor.sys is&nbsp;6/21/2016 - so according to the4 MSINFO program it's the operational driver now</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver&nbsp;c:\windows\system32\drivers\nvstor.sys (10.6.0.23, 158.27 KB (162,064 bytes), 6/21/2016 10:40 AM)<br />
</p>
<p>As I stated in my original post, I'm feeling nubish. What has made this frustrating is I have two other boxes that are basically the same [except for the fact they are 3 years newer] that have performed flawlessly through all the Insider builds. Of course,
 3 years in computer terms is decades in human life (:/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just updated to 14372 so we'll see how things play together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will let it run and report back. Since this has been a pretty regular occurrence I should know soon.</p>

<h2>            .NetFrame 3.5 won&#39;t install after reboot</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I want to install Netframe 3.5 and it tells me to restart my computer to finish the installation. However, when I finish restarting the computer Netframe 3.5 isn't installed on my computer. I've repeated this process multiple times and yielded the
 same results. I've also tried things such as using DSIM and System Update Readiness Tool. Troubleshooting doesn't really help out either. How do I fix this?

            I checked the box before the reboot. After the reboot, I checked back onto the features to see if the install worked, and the box next to Netframe 3.5 remained unchecked. For example, a program prompts me to install Netframe 3.5, I follow the steps needed
 to install and reboot my computer to finish the installation. After the reboot is finished, I go to the program again and the same prompt to install Netframe 3.5 is still there.

<p>Hello Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. First off Home console will only work between two consoles. If the console is getting kicked off the internet connection that is a router issue, which may need to be upgraded. You can view
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
setting home console</a> to make sure you set it the best way possible. Personally I run into this also as I own multiple consoles for all the kids and such. If need further help please reply and we will assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Hey there,&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a15f84e8-05cc-4296-b429-4d33d0089309" title="adamrobinson3">adamrobinson3</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I understand what you have done. You can only set one console as your home Xbox at a time. So if you have three, then one will be able to share your membership. I suspect you have set your home Xbox on your daughters last, which has left your sons
 Xbox and yours that has not been set yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your son signs into your account, and then uses his. The gold membership will be shared. However, when you sign in, it signs your profile off from the other Xbox and your son gets disconnected from multiplayer games as he does not have Xbox live gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, what your trying to do is not possible, unless you shared with your son. Or you took it in turns to play online. Another way is to get your son and daughter to take it in turns on their Xbox's while you play online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or another option would be to pay for Xbox membership on one of your other child's accounts so the other one can share your membership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can suggest this to be a feature, as this will be a good suggestion for large families, here:&nbsp;<a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Xbox Suggestions">https://xbox.uservoice.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, Xbox used to do a deal where all the family got Xbox membership, however this was removed for some reason. Right before Xbox One came out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

            You can only share Gold on one console. And you can only change it 5 times a year. Sharing with 3 consoles isnt possible.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many accounts do you actually have?&nbsp; If you have three consoles, you'll need three accounts.&nbsp; Two accounts can share Xbox Live Gold, not three.&nbsp; The third account will need separate subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, an account can only be used on one console at a time.&nbsp; If you sign in with the same account on another console, the previous console will sign out.</p>

            &nbsp;We are having a similar problem.&nbsp; We have two Xboxes, we made the new one the home Xbox.&nbsp; My son who uses our main account has no problem using either Xbox, my son that is part of the Xbox family cannot use our old Xbox&nbsp; he constantly gets kicked off
 it says he has no Live account. We found a way around this by logging into games and then switching users, but it doesn't always work. If he tries to open games it says he needs to purchase the game or insert the disc. He can only play on the new xbox.&nbsp; I
 can't imagine that to get this working smoothly I need to purchase two live subscriptions and every game twice.

<p style="text-align: center">Hi, sorry but you can't share 3 account, the site says maximum 2, then you should get a live gold to your son separately. or you take the gold separated from your child. still it was a nice feature that unified family.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 not retaining settings for Acer touch screen that is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petridish38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 not retaining settings for Acer touch screen that is not main display</h2>
                    I have a 3-monitor setup and just updated to Windows 8.1. One of those monitors is an Acer T232HL touch screen (on the left)<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3033f313-71c1-4771-9660-407569ddf58f" />
<div><br />
<div>The problem is my touch screen is not my main display (the middle display in the picture is my main display) and every time I touch my touchscreen, the computer thinks I am touching my non-touch main monitor. Basically every touch on my touch screen registers
 on my main display that is not a touch screen. I had this very same problem in Windows 8.0, but found a way to fix it by going to "Tablet PC Settings" and clicking "Setup..." under "Configure" which brought me to the setup procedure (pictured)</div>
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd52f28e-1270-4a09-b091-1755e2b8750d" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After hitting "Enter" on all non-touch displays and touching all touch displays I am not able to have my touches register on my touch screen like it should.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This worked great in Windows 8.0. Now in Windows 8.1 <b>the setting is not retained when I reboot.</b> Each time I boot up I have to go through the entire setup process to get my touch screen to work properly.</div>
                </div>

I would suggest you to install the latest display drivers and update the chipset drivers from the manufactures’ website and check if it helps.</font></span></p>

<div>Thanks for replying. As indicated above I have even gone so far as to reformat my hard drive and perform a clean install of Windows 8.1. This has not worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I do follow the procedures in "Tablet PC Settings" and this works until I reboot; then the settings are lost. This was not the case in Windows 8.0. In Windows 8.0 everything worked as expected.</div>

I'm in the same boat. &nbsp;I have a Samsung ultrabook that upgraded perfectly from 8.0 to 8.1. &nbsp;My main desktop that I built from scratch I'm out of luck. &nbsp;I have the Acer touch monitor. &nbsp;It worked like a charm with 8.0 now it's a regular display monitor with Windows

            <p>The "faulting module" "ole32.dll" is a Windows system file.</p>
<p>However the problem may be another possibly third party file.</p>
<p>It may be useful to try to capture a user-mode dump of the explorer.exe crash to get more information on the crash and see what other files are involved in the crash.<br />
<br />
You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file, then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time explorer.exe crashes&nbsp;should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong><br />
</em><br />
After&nbsp; Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />
<br />
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Internet connection keeps disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a mountain man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Internet connection keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    Ever since upgrading to Windows 10, my Ethernet connection (desktop is cabled directly to my router)&nbsp;my connection to the internet&nbsp;keeps disconnecting.&nbsp; Other devices in my house still keep their connections.&nbsp; So I go to settings and click on diagnose
 connection, connection gets fixed, then I'm back on internet (for awhile anyway), then problem repeats itself.&nbsp; Not sure what the deal is.&nbsp; Occasionally I have had to restart my router to resolve and get back on line.&nbsp; But I just don't understand why the problem
 keeps repeating. I get messages like network adapter needs reset and gateway not available.&nbsp; I go to settings and diagnose connection, and after 5 minutes of internal checking including seeing&nbsp;gateway and network adapter messages, get a green checkmark that
 "now fixed" but problem periodically repeats itself.
