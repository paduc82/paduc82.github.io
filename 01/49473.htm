<h2>            Windows 10 1709 People App getting error 800706be on pinned taskbar contacts</h2>
                    <p>Just installed a Windows 10 Fall Creators version 1709 (newest updates). Trying to set people app so I can easy chat or email to pinned contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it doesn't work, as when I click on the pinned contact it tries to open skype, but gets error&nbsp;0x800706be. The same goes when trying to open pinned contact and choosing People instead of Skype.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Søren,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate your patience regarding your OneDrive.<br />
<br />
Have you already tried performing a Clean Boot? This will disable the unnecessary applications from the startup, and will let you know if a certain app, possibly your OneDrive, is the one really causing the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong> helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when running or installing a program in Windows 10.<br />
<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</em><br />
<br />
Let us know if the same issue will occur after clean boot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

    <title>Reinstallation of Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordontate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstallation of Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Compaq Presario CQ56 Notebook which came with Windows 7 Home Premium pre-installed. I made and retained recovery disks as recommended and the product key is on a label on the Notebook.</p>
<p>The computer is now starting to slow up and perform badly in other ways. For instance it will not go into sleep mode in spite of all attempts to rectify the problem. I am therefore considering installing Windows 7 afresh in the hope this will give the Notebook
 a new lease of life.</p>
<p>I know I could use the recovery disks that would return the machine back to its factory settings. However, I understand these settings include a lot of what I have seen referred to as 'bloatware', i.e programs I probably don't need or want.
</p>
<p>Would it be possible to use a Windows 7 installation disk that was purchased for my wife's computer, instead of the home made recovery disks, or does the product key on the Windows 7 disk prevent its use with my Notebook's product key? I do not know if the
 Windows 7 disk is authorised for use on additional computers and I do not want to invalidate it in case it is ever again needed for my wife's machine. Advice would be very welcome.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>No, but it installs the drivers appropriate for your system that the manufacturer has certified and tested at the time it was manufactured and packaged. You can always download updated drivers from the manufacturers website if any are available.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Certainly using the recovery disc or the retail Windows 7 Home Premium disc will install and almost 4 to 5 year old copy of Windows which would have numerous updates available. Using the recovery disc, you would be in a much better position since
 all you would have focus mostly on is updating your Antivirus and applying the latest Windows Updates.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Using the Windows 7 disc although it provides a pristine install, you will be spending most of the day installing drivers and probably will have to do numerous restarts and then you have Windows 7 updates to install, especially if its a Windows 7
 Home Premium RTM disc (July 2009). </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Keep in mind, both will do a clean install, meaning your personal files and programs will be deleted. So make sure you back those up first:</strong></p>

<p>I have a HP Compaq Presario CQ56 Notebook which came with Windows 7 Home Premium pre-installed. I made and retained recovery disks as recommended and the product key is on a label on the Notebook.</p>
<p>The computer is now starting to slow up and perform badly in other ways. For instance it will not go into sleep mode in spite of all attempts to rectify the problem. I am therefore considering installing Windows 7 afresh in the hope this will give the Notebook
 a new lease of life.</p>
<p>I know I could use the recovery disks that would return the machine back to its factory settings. However, I understand these settings include a lot of what I have seen referred to as 'bloatware', i.e programs I probably don't need or want.
</p>
<p>Would it be possible to use a Windows 7 installation disk that was purchased for my wife's computer, instead of the home made recovery disks, or does the product key on the Windows 7 disk prevent its use with my Notebook's product key? I do not know if the
 Windows 7 disk is authorised for use on additional computers and I do not want to invalidate it in case it is ever again needed for my wife's machine. Advice would be very welcome.</p>

<p>Yes you can, follow the instructions here to convert it to to a Bootable USB and delete the ei.cfg file:</p>

</p>
<p>Install without a product key and&nbsp;apply OEM SLP using ABR as instructed in the same guide which will activate the OEM install correctly without the hassle of calling Microsoft. You may want to use the Backup mechanism on ABR on your current installation
 just in case&nbsp;although the HP cert should be the same for both HP and Compaq. See also Windows 7 installation:</p>

            <p>Thank you all for your contributions in answer to my enquiry.&nbsp; </p>
<p>From what I have read it seems that reinstalling Windows 7 would not be a straightforward procedure and, in the end, might not make any difference to the overall performance of my Notebook which is a pity. I had hoped that, apart from generally speeding
 up operations, a reinstall would reinstate sleep mode and stop the system freezing when I try to make alterations in 'system diagnostics'. It seems I have to look elsewhere for solutions.</p>
<p>Thanks again for taking the trouble to reply.</p>

            <p>Please, take it from me, This is the wrong conclusion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I look after 160 Windows 7 computers and have been for 13 years now.&nbsp; I have done this many, many times.&nbsp; It always results in a dramatically better performing computer.&nbsp; It takes a lot of elapsed time, but the difference will be very gratifying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use <em><strong>any </strong></em>Windows 7 disk that matches the type of your activation code.&nbsp; For example Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost always use a Dell Windows 7 re-install disk, no matter the brand of computer.&nbsp; A version that has
 SP1 will save you a lot of time.&nbsp; In many cases, the activation process will be automatic.&nbsp; If not, type in the activation code on the sticker.&nbsp; If it is not accepted, call Microsoft and ask for their help in activation.&nbsp; They will do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a benefit to not using the OEMs restore disk in that it does not load all the bloat stuff that serves to slow your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not that difficult, in fact you may be amazed at how easy it is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, the Windows 7 install process will install all the drivers you need, and if you set Windows Update to get other Microsoft Updates, Windows Update itself will update your drivers and even provide drivers that were not installed by the Windows
 7 install process itself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a chance that you will need to get a driver from the computer manufacturer, but that is usually not that hard to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;Worst case scenario is when the network driver is not installed automatically by Windows 7 install.&nbsp; In that case, you will need
 another computer to&nbsp;get the driver.&nbsp; You could play it safe and download that driver before you begin the re-build, just in case.&nbsp; Without that driver, you can not get online to get Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the computer manufacturer's web site to get these drivers, not the plethora of driver download sites.&nbsp; It has been my experience that the drivers provided by Windows and Windows update are better than any other source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more assistance in this process, come back to this thread and ask.&nbsp; I will be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do yourself a service and do a lot of diagnostics work on the hardware of your PC before you invest this time. Use the Windows 7 memory tester.&nbsp; Run the drive tester software provided by the hard drive manufacturer.</p>

<p>The Dell Windows 7 Reinstallation DVD is a true Windows installation disk. All it has added is the Dell&nbsp;OEM SLP and Dell branding/logos. Dell OEM SLP activation inputs a generic Dell OEM SLP key from the Dell Windows 7 Reinstallation DVD which will work
 only on Dells with an eligible BIOS. If the BIOS is not eligible you have 9 days to input a genuine key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is different to media created using the likes of Dell Backup and Recovery which is a system image. It is also different from the Dell Direct USB which can also be provided if one procures recovery media and won't work on non-Dell systems:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/desktop/f/3514/p/19629092/20756108#20756108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/desktop/f/3514/p/19629092/20756108#20756108</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell the Recovery Media procured from the likes of&nbsp;HP is usually&nbsp;pretty bad&nbsp;including all the bloatware and is locked to install on specific models which is one of the reasons I never buy anything&nbsp;HP. I have never seen factory settings as
 low in performance as my friends Windows Vista or Windows 7 HP computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its partly the reason that I wrote a guide on using the Digital River .isos and OEM SLP. Microsoft have removed the .isos replacing them with a non-functional Microsoft Recovery Tool which blocks OEM users from reinstalling. Before advising on using other
 installation media to install we need to check that it is actually "proper" installation media.</p>

    <title>Windows stuck in boot loop after trying to revert to previous build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pokeperson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows stuck in boot loop after trying to revert to previous build</h2>
                    After having problems with a windows update, I tried to use the 'Go back to an earlier build' and it started the process, but after a while it entered a boot loop. It repeatedly shows a black screen saying 'Attempting to recover installation' and then
 a screen saying 'Restoring your previous version of windows' both for a combined one second of time. I have a windows 10 installation media and have been able to boot to it. Automated Startup repair did not work, and I opened command prompt and tried a few
 things: bootrec /fixmbr finished successfully, bootrec /fixboot says 'Access is denied.', and bootrec /repairbcd and bootrec /scanos both say I have 0 installations of windows. I have tried using the regback registry instead after backing up, and it did not
 change anything. I ran a few different chkdsk commands, one of them took 6 hours, and it said it found and fixed one bad sector, after which nothing changed. No clue what to do now.

<p>Hi Pokeperson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We encounter this issue mostly on users running an AMD processors. The good is that we already released a fix to sort out this issue. Try to boot to Windows Recovery again and this time, select
<strong>Startup Settings &gt; Safe Mode</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From Safe Mode environment, go to <strong>Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; View installed updates</strong>. Uninstall the
<strong>KB4056891</strong>. Restart your device. If you were able to boot properly, go to
<a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4057144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Update Catalog</a> to download the standalone package for KB4057144 which should fix this issue. Install the update then restart your device if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. When I boot to my installation media then enter the troubleshooting, there is no startup settings option. I can't get into the recovery environment without booting to the installation media for some reason; guides say to hold down
 the power button while the windows logo is on the screen, but in my situation it never is. I have the dell logo with a loading bar at first, then it switches to the same dell logo but with the loading symbol with dots moving in a circle, then a command prompt
 I think pops up for a fraction of a second then it switches to the screen I described in the original post. I have tried turning the computer off while it was showing the dots loading symbol, but that didn't work nor did it when I tried turning the computer
 off while it was at the situation in the original post.

<p>Quite weird. Restart your device while holding the Shift button. Make sure that the bootable media is not plugged in. When it restarts, select
<strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Safe Mode. </strong>
As far as I know, it's on the same screen with System Restore and Command Prompt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still cannot see the Startup Settings, it's probably hidden. Select <strong>
Command Prompt </strong>and follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>bcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu yes </strong>then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Once successful, restart your device.</li><li>If you see the Windows Boot Manager screen, press <strong>F8</strong>.</li><li>Proceed with <strong>Safe Mode</strong> and do the steps above.</li></ol>

            I was able to start safe mode, but it does not finish starting: it shows the black screen with safe mode written in all four corners and Microsoft(R) Windows(R) with some numbers in the top middle, then after a few seconds it gives me the 'Attempting to
 recover installation' and 'Restoring previous version of windows' screens, then goes back the the safe mode screen for a few seconds, then restarts the computer. No clue why this is happening

<p>It depends on the games. Some might work on Windows 10 and other might not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not work, you can try using Windows Xp compatibility mode in Windows 10 and see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other option would be to run Windows Xp in VMplayer or VirtualBox. </p>

<p>As TomJeson64 said, it depends on the game. I actually had the old Unreal Tournament running on an Insider Build of 10 for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One option might be to check Steam and GOG.com and see if the game in question is available. They both have a lot of old games - XP and even earlier - tweaked to work with current versions of Windows. It won't be free, but shouldn't be more than a few bucks
 for the game if available, and they've already gone through the trouble of making it work for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The printers are not listed for print set up In Word, Notepad, Adobe, etc, when I try to add a printer, it tells me the local print spooler service is not running, or the active directory domain services is currently unavailable.&nbsp; The printers are shown

<p>Thank you much for the response onse.&nbsp; I appreciate it.&nbsp; I tried your suggestions and while the fix it did say the print spooler was repaired, it still wouldn't print.&nbsp; I ran the safety scanner and came up with no issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a system restore back to a point before the issue and the printers are now working, apparently something in an update caused an issue.&nbsp; I'll watch it over the next week and see what happens.</p>

    <title>Putting Computer to Sleep manually causing it to beep repeatedly. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chunkyjackson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Putting Computer to Sleep manually causing it to beep repeatedly. Anyone else having this issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After many attempts to use 10 on my HP Pavilion this major problem keeps having me to go back to 7. Over the last week I got 10 to clean install which solved a lot of my problems. The two problems I have left are as follows the minor one being that after
 the computer goes to sleep automatically after a few hours it will wake up on its own, now for the major problem when I put the machine to sleep manually the screen goes blank like it should then it will slow the fans down then boom the high pitched repeating
 beep coming from the machine like there is some kind of hardware failure. This forces me to turn the PSU power switch off because the computer will not respond at all. I know that this is not a hardware issue as this dose not happen at all on 7 as when I put
 the machine to sleep it turn off the screen slows down the fans and it will also write data to the HDD before going into full sleep. I noticed that 10 dose not write any data to HDD before the full sleep mode is activated I think it might be shutting HDD off
 before it can write the save state data to the HDD but I'm not sure. All drivers were from the Windows 10 install (because HP no longer supports this computer) except for my Nvidia GPU I was using the most current Windows 10 driver dated December 29th 2015.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my specs:</p>
<p>HP Pavilion p6310y</p>
<p>AMD Athlon 630 x4</p>
<p>6GB of Ram</p>
<p>Nvidia GTX 660Ti GPU</p>
<p>(pretty much stock the only thing I added was a secondary HDD and 600w PSU)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is last hurdle I need to pass so I can Upgrade to Windows 10 and stay there.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying to answer the 2 questions:</p>
<p>1. No there were no Hardware/Software changes made after this issue this was a fresh install with some non service software post install.</p>
<p>2. No error code just a blank screen and the CPU rapidly beeping all usb devices were turned off by initiating sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now about your troubleshooting suggestion.</p>
<p>I have tried this in the past when I was having issues with my screen saver not working all it dose is rest the turn monitor off and sleep timers. The beeping issue still remains.</p>

            Okay disabling Hybrid Sleep in advanced power settings seems to be a good workaround for now, I'm not sure if this is a driver issue or a Windows 10 issue maybe possibly both.&nbsp; Although like I've said before this issues is only present in Windows 10 not
 in 7.

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tested it.&nbsp; This issue only occurs on the secondary monitor.&nbsp; If I present both my screens or the primary desktop, then the status changes correctly.&nbsp; If I present just the secondary monitor, then my status does not change to "Presenting".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an older program (Maptech.com Marine Navigator 2002 version) This program will not install on my Windows 7 64bit system. It checks the file system to see if its 32 or 64 bit. I have heard of Wow64 but can find NOTHING on where to download it or
 how to get it to work. Obviously I am too stupid to be able to figure this out my self. I tried the windows compatibility mode it doesn't work for this program. &nbsp;I tried to use the Windows virtual machine (I only own 1 copy of windows and the map program I
 want to install isn't worth my having to get a second copy of windows for this install) How can I get Wow64 to work on my system? Or is my only option to ____ and Reinstall?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Scott</p>
<p>In addition to the information posted by Jeeped.</p>
<p>The WOW64 sub-system in the Windows 64bit versions is the compatibility layer component that allows 32bit software to run on the 64-bit versions. This is already integrated in Windows.</p>
<p>If the software program you mentioned is not working properly, I would recommend that you check first with the developer of that program for any compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Here is a link for your convenience.</p>

<p>If your Maptech Marine Navigator or its installation&nbsp;application is a 16 bit based&nbsp;program, I believe you will need to run and install&nbsp;<strong>Virtual PC</strong> in&nbsp;<strong>XP Mode</strong> to have any chance of a fully operational 16 bit subsystem. If
 you are running Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate, you can use<em> Windows XP Mode</em> and<em> Virtual PC</em> without a second Windows license.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: you cannot run XP Mode on Windows Home editions. If you are using Windows 7 Home Premium, you would need to use<strong><em> DosBox</em></strong> or any other 3rd party virtualization
 program that works with Home Premium. Please visit forums dedicated to these programs for more information.</p>

<h2>            Blurry Pictures in Windows Movie Maker when using Pan and Zoom</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am making a movie with Windows Movie Maker 2012 and in my video I am using pan and zoom animations for my jpgs. However, the pan and zoom animations make my jpgs look grainy and&nbsp;wave-y, as if there is a wave going across the screen whenever the movie
 pans this way or that. </p>
<p>How do I keep this from happening? My pics are pretty hi-res, so I'd like for them to look professional.

            <p>Then don't worry about it. Movie Maker will sometimes lower the resolution of the preview to try and show you a real-time view of the applied effects, titles and transitions. But it will often compromise quality for speed of rendering. That's why it is a
 preview and not the final result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judge the quality instead on the final movie when it is saved (File &gt; Save movie). That's what you are aiming for anyway.<br />

<p>In order to get the last hostage and put an end to the Riddler's machinations, you will need to complete over 400 challenges. This includes combat challenges for Batman, solving secrets, and collecting trophies. The Enigma device should eventually give you
 a final riddle and expose Nygma's hideout.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge failure after Windows 10 latest update. Movies and Video is disabled as well, and no videos from You Tube, Twitter, or using Adobe Flash will open in either MS Edge or IE.</h2>
                    I need support assistance over issues caused by the latest Windows 10 update. I no longer have any ability to open videos, from Adobe Flash to You Tube videos and Twitter videos embedded in articles from the Microsoft Edge browser. Amazingly, Microsoft
 Internet Explorer fails to open video now, as well. If it's helpful, along with MS Edge and IE losing the ability to play videos, Microsoft Movies and TV no longer works, and refuses to open like the videos in the browsers. I've already invested upwards of
 20 hours of my time since the Windows update on July 11, 2018 caused this problem, and I no longer believe I have the ability to restore the system. By the way, along with resetting both Microsoft Edge and Movies &amp; TV using the Apps &amp; Features advanced settings
 functionality (twice now), my early attempt to restore my system to July 5, 2018 that appeared as an option for the first of two available restore dates failed just as the reset attempts have. The July 5 date &amp; file w

            HI,  
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Clear browsing history.
<br />
<br />3. Run the SFC scan 
<br />Run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "System File Checker" or "sfc". This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. Here's how: 
<br />1. Press Windows key + X, click Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command, sfc /scannow and then press Enter.  
<br />3. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk 
<br />    and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive.  
<br />4. Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the system. 
<br />
<br />4. Repair and reset the app: 
<br />Right-click on the Start menu button, and select Settings. 
<br />Select App, click on Microsoft Edge from the list, and select Advanced options. 
<br />Select Repair. 
<br />If the issue persists, repeat the steps and select Reset. 
<br />
<br />In case the procedures above didn't work you can try the procedures in the links below:

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death, STOP error 0x00000024 unable to boot Windows XP</h2>
                    I was surfing the net one day when an error window appeared saying 'System Hard Error', and my computer (Inspiron 6000, Windows XP) automatically shut down. I tried turning it on again but during the booting process, the Blue Screen of Death appeared.
 It says:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Technical information:</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Usually when my computer gets the BSOD, i just restart it and everything will be fine afterwards. However, this is the first time my computer gets this persistent error whenever i try to boot. I cannot boot from safe mode or last good configuration at
 all. I can still access my BIOS Setup. I found out that i should boot from the installation CD from other websites; however i am unsure of which CD i should use, or which settings in the BIOS Setup I have to configure. This is very frustrating.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a
<br />
process of elimination :<br />
<br />
Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin) - at the prompt type in <br />
<br />
MSCONFIG <br />
<br />
and hit enter<br />

<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
Do all of these :<br />
<br />
If you had a 3rd&nbsp;party antivirus&nbsp;on the OS you upgraded OR if you&nbsp;have one<br />
now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender<br />
which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus.&nbsp;Despite&nbsp;all the hype&nbsp;out there<br />
Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are&nbsp;true superstars.<br />

<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
Right Click Start button - Control Panel - Troubleshooting - on right side click View all -
<br />
System Maintenance.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and the<strong> major on-board and separate&nbsp;<br />
device&nbsp;</strong><strong>drivers</strong>.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update
<br />
those without&nbsp;Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Uverse startup screen - Press OK</h2>
                    
<p>I have the Xbox connected to my Uverse cable box. &nbsp;When I first turn on everything with "Xbox ON", the initial screen from Uverse says "Press OK to watch TV" . &nbsp;I cannot figure out how to do this without using a remote. &nbsp;How can I get past this screen using
 voice controls??</p>

<p>Hi a2ron44, from talking with AT&amp;T, they said that a power command will also work to get past this screen.</p>
<p>Have you gone into Live TV power settings and enabled "turn on my devices with Xbox On" and "turn off my cable box with Xbox off".</p>

<p>Hey, I actually tried that and it's not helping.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, it worked (after 2 failed tries) in setup — it took it out of the blue screen.
</p>
<p>"Xbox On" isn't even acceptable when watching TV, it keeps thinking the command is "Xbox Pause", "Xbox Stop", or "Xbox Home".
</p>
<p>I'm at a loss here</p>

<h2>            Having problems to log in</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to enter Xbox Live, but when I put my login and password I receive the following message:</p>
<p>"You can not enter. Try again in a few minutes or verify the service status on Xbox Assistance. (0x8007000E)"</p>
<p>I search this code, but the only thing I found about it it's not about login but about installation of a game. Please help me! Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey there Passos! </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having a hard time logging in I would advise going through your network settings and going through the
<strong>Test Network Connection </strong>to see if you are seeing any error messages, If any error messages appear go through the "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I need help with my
 Xbox One network connection</a>" support article. If you do not have any error messages try and
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Physically Power Cycle </a>your Xbox One console and give it another try. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us&nbsp;know if this works. </p>
