            <p>Hey there J18 RSA.<br /><br />To start, be sure your Xbox One is in an open well-ventilated area, as poor ventilation can cause your console to shut off. If you're also using a surge protector, try bypassing that and plug directly into a wall outlet. If you're still having issues, be sure to check out our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/console-turns-off-unexpectedly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One Powering Off Troubleshooter</a>.</p>

                    <p>I don't play my Xbox&nbsp; ONE&nbsp;on a daily basis,&nbsp;having a family doesn't give me a lot of spare time. But when I do turn on my Xbox&nbsp;I want to play a game, hence the reason for turning the Xbox on. But these last 30 days, out of the 10 times, 5 of them gave me a message I need to update my game or OS first before I could continue, making it impossible to let me play the game. Downloading can take for ages...&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>As a user I want to turn on my Xbox and play the game at the time-frame convenient to me and not wait for an update to install. Putting the update&nbsp;before playing a game doesn't make me feel Microsoft is putting the user first.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be a lot friendlier if the update just downloads in the background and installs when I want it to install, instead of the other way round!</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope in the future things will change... the PS4 has better user focus</p><p><br /></p><p>I could use my Xbox offline of course... but th

 </blockquote> <p>Do what I do...Buy a wi-fi plug-in controller/timer (or just a timer) I put the xbox one in stand by mode. Then I plug it into my controller. I can operate that plug remotely via wi-fi, plus I can program it with a timer (as a bonus, it tracks electricity usage over time). Set the timer to turn on for a couple hours each night (or three times a week for 2 hours each) or during the day if you are working away from home.. All controlled from my phone or tablet or computer and I can monitor it away from home, just in case I forget.</p>

            <p>Why don't you simply keep the console disconnected from the internet?<br /><br />It sounds as if you mostly play single player&nbsp;so the lack of an internet connection wouldn't be an issue, unless of course you are desperate to see Achievements pop up during gameplay&nbsp;but you would be able to enjoy your games quickly.<br /><br />Then when you have a little more free time just enable the connection and do the pending updates. Just because something is internet capable, doesn't mean you need to use that connection&nbsp;all the time.</p>

    <title>BSOD after windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willwork4food  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD after windows update</h2>
                    <p>I use Windows 10, and a Dell monitor S2230 MX, capable of 1920x1080 @60 Hz resolution.&nbsp; My graphics card is NVIDIA Quadro FX 1700.&nbsp; All worked perfectly until the most recent windows update on 12/8/2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the update, the display adapter was Microsoft
 Basic Display Adapter.&nbsp; I downloaded the appropriate driver from NVIDIA and installed.&nbsp; Although the installation reported it "failed', the driver resolution problem was resolved and the display driver shows the NVIDIA driver is working properly.&nbsp; However,
 soon after, I began to get blue screen reports and have nine (9) bugchecks since 12/09/2016 in the event viewer.&nbsp; These 9 events are not all the same.&nbsp; I have seen at least three types of error:</p>
<p>- critical process died</p>
<p>- IRQL not less or equal</p>
<p>- system service exception</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the latest three bugcheck details:</p>

            <p>I ran Driver View again for all drivers and updated OneDrive with the results.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also captured the all system events and placed the results in OneDrive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I ran Driver Verifier for all drivers.&nbsp; It required a restart so I restarted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon restart, I have gotten four BSOD screens so far, each stating 'special_pool_detected_memory_corruption.' &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon the second instance, and every instance after, I see a message that 'Windows didn't load correctly'.&nbsp; I have a choice to 'see advanced repair options', or 'restart my pc'.&nbsp; I chose 'restart my pc' and another BSOD as noted above.&nbsp; Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to another PC to post this status.</p>

            <p>No one responding since my last post.&nbsp; So I continued on my own.&nbsp; I used a windows 10 repair disk to go back to last restore point.&nbsp; This finally enabled me to boot up again.&nbsp; I have since tried to install 3 versions of the NVIDIA quadro FX 1700 driver.&nbsp;
 All installs "fail".&nbsp;&nbsp; I also ensured that I am current on all windows updates.&nbsp; I received two windows updates for the NVIDIA driver, but they, too, fail to install.&nbsp; I have saved multiple screenshots to my One Drive folder showing details from device manager
 properties and event viewer failure to install.&nbsp; See all added screenshots and text file of "event viewer nvidia quadro fx 1700 needs further installation.txt" here:

            I had the same issue. what i did is I started in clean slate since Windows 10 is such a mess. I Backup all files in an external drive then reset my PC. "keep nothing" then update EVERYTHING including drivers before reinstalling my software and apps. so
 far, BSOD not happening.&nbsp;

            <p>I updated <span><span><strong>NetTcpPortSharing&nbsp; </strong>(it was not running) and confirmed it remains in effect after a restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried Driver Verifier again, went through multiple rounds of BSOD special pool detected memory corruption, restart, windows
 did not load correctly, etc.&nbsp; Then I chose advance repair to get to a command prompt, ran verifier only for special pool, force IRQL, and a few more, selecting all drivers not provided by Microsoft.&nbsp; Restart, BSOD special pool, etc.&nbsp; Ran verifier again doing
 a /querysettings, /reset, /bootmode oneboot, for special pool and force IRQL checking with only NVIDIA drivers selected.&nbsp; more BSOD special pool, restart, etc.&nbsp; Did advanced repair, startup repair(couldn't repair), did a system restore.&nbsp; System up, system
 installed two windows updates for NVIDIA drivers, successfully.&nbsp; Shutdown system after creating a restore point and backing up entire system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Restarted this morning, soon got some screen flickers, checked display in device manager, found drivers not installed
 (code 28).&nbsp; I am back to square one.</span></span><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't work for Microsoft and there are no Product Keys sent from here.</p>
<p>And Microsoft does not know what your Product Key is anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how a reinstall and activation works:</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc) is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard, so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reinstall it will pick up the Product Key and activate the system&nbsp;automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not, follow these steps:</p>

            Hello,<br />
&nbsp;I am using internet&nbsp;explorer. It is not just one website, it can be several.&nbsp; I can type with the keyboard www. yahoo.com. However once I am on that&nbsp;site I cannot&nbsp;type&nbsp;in&nbsp;the search box. I have to&nbsp;turn off&nbsp;&amp; on my laptop. Yes, while I am online I can go into&nbsp;Word
 &amp; type a letter. It is just on&nbsp;the webpage and not all the time.<br />
It has happened on 3 different webpages.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The&nbsp;laptop is&nbsp;was purchased in Aug 2012 &amp; it has only happened 3 times.&nbsp;Does anyone know of a key that locks the&nbsp;keyboard when you are on a webpage?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you<br />

Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Could you provide us the exact error message along with the error code, if any?<br />
b. Which commands have you already tried from in the diskpart utility?<br />
c. I would recommend you to perform the complete format rather than the quick format and check.<br />
d. Also try formatting the drive on a different computer and check.</span></span></p>

I would recommend you to use the clean command to delete and format all the partitions on the external&nbsp;drive and check. Refer to the article below for more information.

<h2>            how to change product key on windows 7 OEM</h2>
                    
<p>I brought up a computer with windows 7 proffessional preinstalled. It has the OEM product key already activated, but I would like to change the product key to our volume licence key. In the other computers I can go to the computer properties and view the
 basic information and where there is the product key there is a link to change it, but in this one that came preloaded from the vendor I don't have the link.<br />
Any suggestions?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            The answer is no, volume license key is hard coded. What you should do is get a copy of the volume license media and do a in place upgrade from Windows 7 Professional (OEM) to Windows 7 Professional (volume license).

<p>When attempting to download photos from my Panasonic DMC-ZR1 through USB the following pops up on the "Import Photos and Videos" screen</p>

<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access is denied</em></p>
<p>This occurs with each succeeding photo and if I then say accept with errors I don't get the photos even though it appears as if they have been downloaded.</p>
<p>HELP</p>

<h2>            The &#38;quot&#59;I would like to see...&#38;quot&#59;  thread</h2>
                    
<p>Normal 0 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 </p>
<p>I wish they never changed these forums.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since the first game came out, I had posted a thread before each expansion listing cards I would like to see as potential unlockables.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then it was always a nice surprise to see a few of my picks, make it into the expansion.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Surprisingly however, is the shear number of picks that have made it into this game.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would have loved to have been able to link to those old threads, but alas I can not.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>So with that said, here are some new picks for what I would like to see in the next expansion:</p>
<p><br />
Chandra:<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Siege Gang Commander- I don’t care what red deck they put it in but seriously!
</li><li>Stigma Lasher-<span>&nbsp; </span>Punishing fire is awesome but we should further kick Life-gain card users in the groin!
</li><li>Demon Fire- Better than Blaze </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Koth:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Earthquake-<span>&nbsp; </span>More sweepers are greatly needed, the flavor seems fitting for Koth
</li><li>Jaws of Stone- another flavor fitting card </li><li>Ashling the Pilgrim- Awesome creature </li></ul>
<p>Garruk:<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lignify-<span>&nbsp; </span>Just a piece of spot removal that seems fitting and not overly powerful for Green
</li><li>Harmonize- Awesome card draw </li><li>Tooth and Nail-<span>&nbsp; </span>Less broken than if this was in the ramp deck </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gideon:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Day of Judgement-<span>&nbsp; </span>Sweeper that makes regen stronger
</li><li>Basilisk Collar- Awesome equipment that’s not too powerful for the deck </li><li>Steelshaper’s Gift-<span>&nbsp; </span>Decent tutor. Nothing more </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jace:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Counterbalance-<span>&nbsp; </span>I have a sweet spot for bomb enchantments </li><li>Glen Elendra Archmage-<span>&nbsp; </span>Great creature- would like to see the persist mechanic
</li><li>Ancestral Vision-<span>&nbsp; </span>I want to see the suspend mechanic, this is SOOOO good!
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soren:<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Kalastria Highborn-<span>&nbsp; </span>This deck could Greatly use another bomb 2 drop, the early game is pretty terrible
</li><li>Profane Command-<span>&nbsp; </span>Any of the commands would be awesome but especially here as there are currently no other recursion effects in the game
</li><li>Mutilate- Another Awesome sweeper that this game drastically needs </li></ul>
<p>Nissa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elvish Branchbend- Fun elf that fits the “numbers matter” theme of this elf deck
</li><li>Allosaurus Rider-<span>&nbsp; </span>Alternative costs are cool and fun with counterspells
</li><li>Sylvan Messenger-<span>&nbsp; </span>Card drawing elf </li></ul>
<p>U/G Ramp:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green Sun’s Zenith-<span> &nbsp; </span>fits into early or late game, good utility for this deck
</li><li>Mystic Snake-<span>&nbsp; </span>Awesome card! </li><li>Rampant Growth- If you’re gonna ramp… </li></ul>
<p>Sarkan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fling-<span>&nbsp; </span>seems fun here! </li><li>Blood Cultist-<span>&nbsp; </span>Better early game card </li><li>Predator Dragon- I really like the Devour mechanic here </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tez:<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Esperzoa-<span>&nbsp; </span>adds a great deal of speed to an otherwise pretty slow deck
</li><li>Windwright Mage- Another Decent early creature </li><li>Tidehollow Sculler-<span>&nbsp; </span>I thought there were some cards using the exile zone, if so…
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Rumored New Decks***</p>
<p>U/R:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Swerve-<span>&nbsp; </span>Cool card that adds tons of awesome possible plays
</li></ul>
<p>G/W:<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Oversoul of Dusk- Pure 100% Awesome </li><li>Qasali Ambusher-<span>&nbsp; </span>Fun card! </li><li>Gaddock Teeg-<span>&nbsp; </span>Fun Powehouse card! </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liliana:<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Nixathid- Great creature for a discard deck, was disappointed this never made it into the first game.
</li><li>Duress/ Thoughtseize-<span>&nbsp; </span>Any card that shows us opponent’s hand and lets us choose will be Amazing!
</li><li>Dark Confidant-<span>&nbsp; </span>Just an awesome creature </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...So those are my picks,&nbsp; I always try to stay within the boundaries of this game.&nbsp; No planeswalkers, or mana producing creatures, etc.&nbsp; What would you like to see?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to completely wipe and factory reset the Xbox 360 slim&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to completely reset my 360 Slim back to when i first pulled it out of the box, walkthroughs and all. How can i do this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my gamesaves in the cloud storage. I am concerned about whether or not i will be able to restore my profile and retrieve my cloudsaves afterwards?</p>

<p>You can factory reset by:</p>
<p>1) Go to System Settings &gt; Console Settings</p>
<p>2) Make a note of the Console Serial number under System Info</p>
<p>3) Go to Memory and press Y</p>
<p>4) Select Format (Make sure you don't leave anything you don't want to be deleted on the console.)</p>
<p>5) Enter Serial Number, and you should be good!</p>
<p>Note: this will not delete your gamer profiles, game saves etc. So you should have no issues getting them back from the cloud.</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>

</p><p>I've recently ran into a problem when charging the laptop, it seems to freeze/lock up completely after being idle for 2 minutes, requiring a force shut down using the power button. When the laptop isn't charging however, running on the battery, everything
 seems to work perfectly fine, and it can be left idle all day long without freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scanned the system for corrupted files, which turned up with no problems, and I've ran a disc check which also turned up with no issues, and I've also done a system restore, which seemed to have fixed the problem, but it returned again after a few
 days and it's back to locking up after being idle for 2 minutes while charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know what the problem could be? Is it hardware or software related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

            Hi Hayley.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />5) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>BAZZATHE1,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sorry you're having issues with your Elite controller. Are you referring to the magnet part that sticks onto the controller, or the stick itself moving in game when you do not want it to? If you see there is something physically broken on it (pieces&nbsp;not
 staying on, or drifting inside games) then you'll need to send it into device support using<a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this link</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My Elite controller left thumb sick floats up and down. &nbsp;I've only had it for about 7 months with very limited use. &nbsp;Microsoft only has a 90 day warranty, for a faulty product which is BS for a $200 controller! Every other company I know of would replace
 a defective product and stand by their products, but Microsoft doesn't. Don't buy an elite controller from Microsoft because they produce defective products and will not replace them.

<h2>            Keep receiving prompt for backing up encryption keys</h2>
                    
<p><em>Original Title: backup your file encryption keys</em></p>
<p>my windows 7 ultimate laptop is prompting me to backup my file encryption keys. When I run "cipher /u /n" from a run as admin command line, the result is "the system cannot find the file specified"<br />
<br />
Why would I be being prompted out of the blue to backup encryption keys?<br />
<br />
( In the tray, there is a "solve PC issues" flag.&nbsp; It says to schedule a system backup. )<br />
<br />
( also, I downloaded the source code of a web programming book.&nbsp; After that download the encrypt your keys prompt started. Those folders and files display in green text in windows explorer. Normally with zip files I copy them to another directory to unzip em.
 That does not happen with these files.&nbsp; Are these green files encrypted somehow? )<br />
<br />
thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi SteveRichter,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There could be a possibility that the encryption keys are not being recognized by the files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s verify the same by trying to backup the encryption files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    When I initiate a video call to my brother (or he to me), I can see and hear him, but he can only hear me. &nbsp;I get a banner that says my camera is in use by another application (which concerns me, since I don't have any other video-active apps). &nbsp;After
 seven minutes and a few seconds, we are cut off. &nbsp;After reconnecting, we have another seven minutes or so before the next disconnect. &nbsp;Why is this happening?

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Good Day! </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for that information.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To start, are you both using the latest version of Skype? If not, we highly suggest for you to have the new version. With that, please uninstall and re – install the Skype application,
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10634/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10634/</a>, and then get the latest version of Skype. This is applicable for the classic Skype App.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using the Skype for Windows 10, we suggest just to update the version, as the said app is already built in/pre-installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks! &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Roy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can delete the sip_roy@****.com file to have a shot. This directory will be rebuilt when the Lync client starts next time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, please provide full view screenshot of external communications <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">
via PM</a></p>
<p>by logging in to the Skype for Business Admin center&gt;organization&gt;external communications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also need to confirm the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can all the contacts be added, both internal and external?</li><li>Have you tested if all the users cannot add contacts in Skype for Business?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the "ShayTeam" group:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached are 3 images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;shayteam.png - The team defined in outlook 2016, all members are internal office 365 users.</p>
<p>2. skype.png - As u can inside Skype showing as presence unknown, with question mark.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;skype group.png - Another group, different type, a Skype only local group, showing all previous</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;group members as Available and online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why is the outlook group stuck on Updating / Presence Unknown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the Skype-exchange connection:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I succeeded in connecting Skype using power-shell (add to install and run some stuff)</p>
<p>Why do i need to run this:</p>
<p>"<em><strong>Invoke-CsUcsrollback -identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***"?</strong></em></p>
<p>Need to run for every user i want to add?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't all of this connected to the fact the UCSConnectionState showing as "down"?</p>
<p>What should correct value there?</p>

            <p>Hi Roy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your detailed information.</p>
<p>Exchange Online is configured to store Skype for Business Online users' contacts as part of their Exchange mailbox.
</p>
<p>Now, your <strong>Contact List Provider</strong> is the Skype for Business server, and UCS connection Down, which means the contacts list is stored by Skype for Business Online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the following.</p>
<p>Check that all the necessary Domain Name System (DNS) records for Exchange Online Autodiscover are present. Lync uses the Exchange Autodiscover service to connect to the user’s mailbox. If the Autodiscover service isn’t working correctly, Lync won’t be able
 to pull the user’s contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then open your Skype for Business&gt;click the gear (Options)&gt;Personal&gt;tick the following options (Exchange and Outlook integration)</p>
<p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=91353ac8-5a37-4fa3-97df-006eeecca822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d91353ac8-5a37-4fa3-97df-006eeecca822" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then remove the problematic contacts in Skype for Business, and re-add them to give it a shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above don’t work, I need to confirm the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you using Skype for Business online or the on-premises Lync server?</li><li>Are you using Exchange online or the on-premises Exchange server?</li><li>Are the problematic contacts users or groups? If they are groups, which type of group, the Office 365 group or the Distribution group?</li><li>Provide your <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">
sign-in address via PM</a>, I’ll check the DNS records.</li></ol>

            <p>I'm adding a response here to help folks who may have run into the problem I was having. I upgraded my Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro and for the longest time after the update I kept running into installation/upgrade issues with various applications including
 iTunes, Skype, etc... The event log would show that the installer errors out for various but one of the common errors would be 1603 or 1602 &nbsp;etc... I was just living with an older version of iTunes. The problem seemed like some sort of permissions issue but
 I don't fully understand Window's permissions on the various folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So searching around I ran into this tool from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tweaking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.tweaking.com</a>&nbsp;to repair a windows installation and so I downloaded their free version and ran it and to my surprise it fixed the
 problems. The program runs a bunch of different Microsoft tools to fix-up your Windows installation and some of these tools take a while to complete. I think on my system, the tweaking program ran for 2+ hrs in safe mode. But one of the areas it "fixes" is
 to set all the default permissions to the various folders (Program Files, Windows, etc...). I don't know why my system was messed up and can only assume it was the "windows 10 update" that didn't handle things well but the tweaking tool fixed it for me and
 now I'm able to install all of the problem programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tool is also real good at telling the user (and providing an interface) to 1) backup their registry, and 2) create a save point in case things go badly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may arise if the currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt or if your PC requires an update&nbsp;for issues that may conflict with a USB device and Windows. This
 may also occur if your USB controllers may have become unstable or corrupt. So, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<h2>            Lost Windows 10 Pro After Factory Reset</h2>
                    <p>My daughter, who&nbsp;is working in Chile,&nbsp;has a new HP laptop which was pre-installed with Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>I paid for an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for the laptop back in February.</p>
<p>After a recent&nbsp;automatic update the laptop locked up and had to be sent back to HP in Chile under warranty to be fixed.</p>
<p>They performed a factory reset but the laptop now only has Windows 10 Home again. All her files were lost, but&nbsp;she has backups of most.</p>
<p>I bought the upgrade from the Microsoft Store but all the details, copies of the transaction, etc, were on the laptop itself.</p>
<p>These more recent files were not backed up.</p>
<p>How do we get Windows 10 Pro back?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 DHCP service configuration used by Hyper-v default virtual - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fabiolobao  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 DHCP service configuration used by Hyper-v default virtual switch</h2>
                    <p>I would like to change the configuration of the DHCP service that responds under the default switch used by the HyperV virtual machines to access the internet.</p>
<p>In my case the VM get the address in the range 172.24.160.0/28 and I would like to change it to 192.168.100/24 plus set a different nameserver as default to be forwarded to the VM.</p>
<p>The connection is working and I can get internet connection on the VM, although the nameserver is not set properly and I need to setup manually for each machine.</p>
<p>I tried using powershell on the host machine to get the DHCP configuration but Get-DhcpServerSetting is not recognized by the system (just through me CommandNotFoundException).</p>
<p>Tried searching the registry but could not get from where this IP is coming from after searching it.</p>
<p>My system is a Windows 10 Pro, version 1803 (updated ‎19/‎05/‎2018). VM are running Ubuntu 18, servers and desktop.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install xbox wireless adapter drivers on windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>So i have tried multiple different options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what happens or what i try, my PC will not recognise any wireless update drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am presented with a message saying "unable to install XBOX ACC at the end when i try and update the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method of downloading the drivers from the Microsoft Update Catalogue doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple other people have said that they've been in contact with Microsoft support and no results were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even returned the product and swapped it for a new one and the result is still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone help?</p>

            None of these solutions fixed anything. I literally unplugged XBOX wireless adapter from my computer and plugged it into my brothers. It worked immediately. I plugged it back into my PC and again it didn't work.&nbsp;

<p>Before we download the newest version of System Update, let's disable and re-enable the USB Root. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the Search bar, type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> to open the <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.<br />
Note You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</li><li>Right-click the each USB hub, and then click Uninstall to remove it.</li></ol>
<p>Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB root hubs that you uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this works.</p>

            This also didn't work, i did exactly that. I uninstalled each USB HUB individually, restarted my PC and when I tried it again after startup, still unable to update the drivers or anything of the kind for the device.

<p>Neither of these options worked either. I uninstalled the update through the Windows Recovery, It then told me when i logged back into the computer that it's already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there more options to explore with this or?</p>
