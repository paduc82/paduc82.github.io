    <title>McAfee Livesafe being paused by Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            McAfee Livesafe being paused by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my desktop to Windows 10 and while I am pleased overall, I am having some difficulty with McAfee Livesafe that appears to be related to the OS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever the desktop is locked, scheduled scans will begin on schedule, but they appear to be paused after just a few moments. &nbsp;If a scan is running and I lock the desktop, or the desktop is locked by the screensaver, the scan is paused. &nbsp;If I go into the
 McAfee application and simply open the section on scanning, the scan will resume; but the next time the machine is locked it will pause again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates to the McAfee library have a similar issue. &nbsp;If the desktop is locked, the update will try to begin (there will be a notification that an update is underway and that it is paused) and when I open the application to the update screen, it will immediate
 begin with step one (find the update) and then continue as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if there is some feature that is preventing McAfee from running in the background. &nbsp;I have seen similar behavior with the xBox Music application; if it is minimized it will stop uploading to the cloud, for example. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>I'm having&nbsp;a similar issue but mine doesn't seem to be paused. It just will never complete the update....EVER, it tries, and tries and tries. It is causing my whole system to lock up and eventually be unresponsive when it is trying to do the update. My taskbar
 will show that McAfee is updating but when I try to open the program (and that is if I can open it because most of the time it is&nbsp;also unresponsive and won't actually open) the update will start and finish in usually less than a minute.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that anytime the McAfee icon in the taskbar has the little blue circle going around and it is "updating" my entire system locks up and nothing works right. I've taken it off of automatic install and set it to notify me when updates are available
 and then I install them. It seems to be working this way but kind of a pain. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Craig said, Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I also had major system problems with Windows 10-updates of the vulnerabilty scanner not working, scans not getting past 50 %-and yet prior to me downloading Windows 10 it worked like a charm.I got Windows 10 the day it was released and wow what a major
 mistake that was-essentially Beta! I got so annoyed I uninstalled 10 and went back to windows 8.1.I am not sure if I will bother with Windows 10 again-though the layout and other features are quite good.Go back to 8.1 and wait for the bugs etc to be resolved
 by MSN perhaps.I am.<br />

<p>Do you people at Microsoft ever wonder why this has not been marked as helpful?&nbsp; That's because it is not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem, 11 June 2016, and it is nothing to do with a power plan because I have everything set to "always on".&nbsp; And in case you didn't notice (or just don't care because you have met your quality contol response time), this is about Windows
 10.&nbsp; The link&nbsp;you provided above is for Windows 8!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is this a recommendation from Microsoft to return to Windows 8 in order to resolve this issue?&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Yeah, I mostly post here because occasionally some fellow user will offer something useful... &nbsp;:D</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI for anyone else having the same problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue turned out to be on McAfee's end... &nbsp; they acknowledged it and created a fix. &nbsp;It worked for me... &nbsp;but I actually needed to uninstall and reinstall Livesafe - it's pretty straightforward you just log into your McAfee account and select your machine
 and click to reinstall. &nbsp;It'll download the .exe and get you going.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I occasionally still see the "paused" notification for McAfee when the machine has been locked; but the updates and scans are actually working now.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got my xbox one x a few days ago (I've had one s, one, all the 360's, and the original) and holy
<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> is this thing noisey!!! It sounds like I'm burning a disk on a 2004 PC the optical drive is so loud it's almost overpowering my tv audio. Is this normal? I read some people having issues with fan noise but i domt hear
 the fans at all. And before you ask, it happens with or without a disc. Even when youre just on the main menu screen and has since the second i started it up. I get it when youre downloading a disc but jesus if this continues I don't know if I'm going to be
 able to keep this thing...</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! If there is a lot of mechanical noise coming from your console, then it may have an issue with either one of the fans since there is not disc in the console. Sometimes a bearing can go bad and cause these sounds. Check out our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Support</a> page for service options and warranty information for your console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, thanks again.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try changing adapters and bindings order in the advanced panel of network connections.<br />
<br />
In the start menu, search for 'network connections' and press enter.<br />
<br />
In the window the comes up, use Alt-key for menu. Choose Advanced. (alt-n-s) On the Adapters and Bindings tab, re-order the connections, putting your wired connection at the top.<br />
<br />
When more than one network connection is available, Windows uses the one with the lowest metric value.&nbsp; By default, it automatically assigns a metric value based on the network connection's rated speed.&nbsp; See An explanation of the Automatic Metric feature for
 Internet Protocol routes .<br />
<br />
To force Windows to use a specific network connection, assign a metric value to each one, giving the lowest value to the desired connection:<br />
<br />
1. Open the Network Connections folder (Start &gt; Run &gt; ncpa.cpl)<br />
2. Right click the desired connection.<br />
3. Click Properties &gt; Internet Protocol Version 4.<br />
4. Click Properties &gt; Advanced.<br />
5. Un-check "Automatic metric".<br />
6. Enter a number between 1 and 9999 for the "Interface metric".

<p>Okay... so it works sometimes... I am finding that it will at times default back to the LAN connection for no reason at all. Any other ways to securly lock it down so that the internet always looks for the Wireless first?</p>

<div>I want to use the windows speech regoniztion, but when I open it, it says "windows speech recognition does not support the current language"... I am swedish, therefor I have my computer language on swedish, but apprently I need to change landuage for it
 to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BUT, when I try to "update windows update online" it says that there is no optional or normal updates available.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Picture:&nbsp;http://postimage.org/image/mue4ug0jv/</div>

</div>
<div>So, when I try to change language, the window box is white, not even an option to change...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div><br />
<div>Well okay, thanks for one of the answers. Sadly Ultimate costs way to much for me at this stage...</div>
<div><br />
<div>IS there anyone that knows how to fix the windows speech recognition without changing language (which apprently I can¬¥t).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If not at least I think it is a bit scam for money if you sell a product with for example windows speech recognition but you can¬¥t launch it on the product.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyways, help always appreciated!</div>

<h2>            Virtual machine on Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    Can I install Microsoft's virtual machine on Windows 10 Pro on a 32 bit computer. If yes, can you send me a link. If no, what is the best alternative. I want to run a Windows XP software.

            <p>I assume by Microsoft virtual machine you mean Hyper V.If Yes,I would like to inform you that Hyper v isn't available for 32 bit systems.However,there are always alternates and you can use Virtualbox or VmWare to install a virtual machine.</p>

<h2>            Vista SP1 upgrade fails &#58; after 100&#37; installation of phase 3 the upgragde installation rolls back and show later error code 80070057</h2>
                    <p>The Vista SP1 upgrade (KB936330) fails.</p>
<p>I tried the upgrade presented by the automatic Windows upgrade.</p>
<p>I tried the standalone, downloadable version.</p>
<p>I tried the different Microsoft Fix Its (e.g. the Fix it portable).</p>
<p>All in vain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The funny thing is that installs completely (including the 100% installation of phase 3), but then rolls back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error code I get is a general error code 80070057. </p>
<p>No specific reason is given.</p>
<p>There is plenty of room on the hard disk (so, the 6GB limit is not the issue).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each installation and roll back takes approximately 3 hours.</p>
<p>I've already made 9 attemps.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your advice.</p>
<p>Given your advice, I additionally tried two times (each time more than two hours).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2, with the "Fix It" which resets the Windows Update Components was of no help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1, with the "Clean Boot" (i.e. with all non-Microsoft apps and services off) didn't do the trick either.&nbsp; This method assumes somewhere a running service is blocking the update or a not running service is lacking in order to perform the SP1 update.
 Which one (or which ones) ?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I tried even without the Firewall (Windows Firewall), Microsoft Security Essentials (Microsoft Antimalwere &amp; Windows Defender) turned on and with User Access Control turned off.
</p>
<p>Just for the record, these services are also running (given advices elsewhere to check them), i.e.:</p>
<p>Windows Driver Fondation </p>
<p>Windows Event Reporting Service </p>
<p>Windows Event Collector </p>
<p>Windows Event Log </p>
<p>Windows Installer</p>
<p>Windows Modules Installer</p>
<p>WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Discovery</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the failed installation of the Vista SP1, each time a virtual Netword Adapter is installed but not correctly (i.e. the Microsoft WAN Miniport SSTP , but I can remove it each time (by running netcfg -e -u ms_sstpminiport at the CMD prompt). Elsewhere,
 it is even mentioned that this doesn't bother a new attempt to install the Vista SP1 update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the long list of Windows updates, there is only one which has failed and never later was installed successful, i.e. the KB960225 (Vulnerability in the S-Channel), however manually downloading and reinstalling the update revealed that it couldn't install,
 since irrelevant, not existant on my system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I only could detect why the Vista SP1 did not install and after 100% install of the Phase 3 (last phase) of the upgrade, keeps on "Reverting Changes".&nbsp; That Error Code 80070057 is really of no help.</p>
<p>Anybode any suggestions ?</p>
<p>Greetings<br />

                    There's a file on my computer that I want to delete, but when I try to delete it, it says administrator permission is needed. So I click continue and it says "Folder access denied" and that I still need permission to complete the action. The problem is
 that I am the administrator as well as having ownership of the file, so all other responses I have seen to fix this sort of problem have not worked for me.

            There is no such built-in ability to show the "Windows 7" or "Classic" style menu in Windows 10. &nbsp;Did you perhaps install some kind of extra program to accomplish this? &nbsp;There's several such programs available, like "ClassicShell" and "Start8" from the
 StarDock company. If you installed one of those, go to your control panel to remove/uninstall it and your Start menu will return to normal.

</p><p>Sorry for the delay.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try right clicking Task bar to open task Manager, on Details tab look for msiexec.exe to End Process or Task.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Now try uninstall again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this fails try these steps to repair or reinstall MS Installer.&nbsp; Some are for previous versions but should still work, the reinstall script is tested and works for Windows 10: &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My laptop won&#39;t boot even in safe mode&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop powered off earlier today and when I tried to reboot it I got an error from Windows Boot Manager reading:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File: Windows\System32\Drivers\RapportKELL.sys</p>
<p>Status: 0xc0000098</p>
<p>Info: WIndows failed to load because a critical system driver is missing, or corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The laptop is a Dell Inspiron 1525 and runs a windows vista operating system.</p>
<p>I've tried running in safe mode and this won't work. I believe Rapport is some sort of software which my bank promted me to download. Is there a way of removing the file from my hard drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just ran diagnostics and ended up with error code 0142 and 2000-0142.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access a computer on a workgroup network Win 10 pro.</h2>
                    I have added a new computer to a workgroup network. The 3 other computers are all the exact same computers purchased together at the same time. After adding the new computer, I can see it from all computers on the network. The new computer can see all
 the old computers and access files on them. On the 3 older computers, one computer can see and access files on the new computer, but the other 2 computers can only see the new computer only. I get a Error code: 0x80070035, The network path was not found. When
 I run troubleshooter, it says Windows can't find"\\MAIN-TIM\IPC$". The name might be misspelled. They all have Windows 10 Pro, Version 1803, OS Build 17134.112, any help would greatly be appreciated.&nbsp;

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  What's working most for network detection issues caused by Version 1803 is here:  <a href="https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/network-computers-no-longer-present-in-file-explorer-on-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/networ...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />There are Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409269...</a>
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot  sharing problems:

<br />
<br />This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>

<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Sticky Notes app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Thanks for the reply greg. I did everything you asked but it still doesn't work. I had tried to re-register again and again it shows me this. --&gt; As you can see when my cursor hovers the sticky note icon at the taskbar,&nbsp; a half visible new note appears
 but see nothing.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61a2d21b-7964-46c6-b40f-88b7ec0b501a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61a2d21b-7964-46c6-b40f-88b7ec0b501a?upload=true" /></a>

            If the reset and re-register do not work then the next step is to reinstall sticky notes as shown here: <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/sticky-notes-currently-not-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/sticky-notes-cur...</a>

            Use the following to remove the Sticky app completely:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Windows-10-Store-Apps-5f60b9e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcen...</a>
<br />
<br />Download, extract, launch it, scroll through the list, select Sticky Notes then click Remove.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer and redownload Sticky Notes:
<br />
<br />Get Microsoft Sticky Notes - Microsoft Store
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-sticky-notes/9nblggh4qghw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-sti...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you perform a repair upgrade next.

            Try the Apps troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />What happened exactly when you attempted each of the steps I've given?  One of them should have worked.
<br />
<br />If nothing works then you may need to Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem appears, you may try to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
