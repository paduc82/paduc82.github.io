<h2>            Xbox One Afterglow Controller is not working on Win 10</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>firstly sorry for my bad english, but there is no other way to contact anybody at microsoft.</p>
<p>Recently I bought the Xbox One afterglow controller, but when I try to play a game the controller only works for like a minute or so. After that I have to reconnect the controller and nothing changes. It worked fine with the Xbox 360 Controller but it physically
 broke so I had to buy a new one.</p>
<p>If you need more information just ask I'll try my best t to answer.</p>

    <title>HDCP Issues with Hyper V and AMD video drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HDCP Issues with Hyper V and AMD video drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have purchased a legitimate copy of Windows 8 Pro and have acquired two films through Xbox video, I also have a Netflix account. Whenever I&nbsp;try to watch the purchased videos or play a movie through Netflix I receive the following errors.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2a14397-2e1c-4f68-a763-b84249d2ed2d" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c30afcd-ea1d-4d97-b419-2bc4be6969ac" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;After much&nbsp;research&nbsp;I understand that it can be caused by a combination of different things.</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Video Drivers</li><li>Hyper V</li><li>Windows Media Player/Xbox Video bug</li><li>Windows 8 bug</li></ul>
<p>Here is&nbsp;my computer&nbsp;specification</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01dffdb0-4296-4127-b9f1-de22e5a724bd" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b55056f5-a433-4d91-8fed-55f2a10f2606" /></p>
<p>As you can see I have the latest driver installed, I have also&nbsp;tested video playback from these apps on every previous version of the video driver. I also require Hyper V and Windows 8 (as is) for work so these things cannot be compromised.&nbsp; I have also
 opened up posts on the following forums so please do not try and direct me to someone else.</p>

            <blockquote>I had the issue as well. I resolved it by uninstalling Hyper-v.&nbsp; Not a great solution as this was the reason I went for Windows 8 Pro.

<p><br />
It's a nasty problem. Another work around is at <a href="http://digitalmediaphile.com/index.php/2012/12/16/a-fix-for-wmc8-hdcp-hyper-v-video-display-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, if you are running these programs INSIDE a VM, it does not help.</p>

<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Documents and settings of Windows XP has been replaced by AppData in windows Vista</span><span>In Vista, the biggest
 change in the arrangement of a user's settings is the creation of the AppData folder.&nbsp; Furthermore, this AppData folder has three subfolders, Local, LocalLow and Roaming.&nbsp; As with Local Settings, a folder called Application Data exists in Vista for backwards
 compatibility with XP.<br />
</span><span><br />
If you look closely at the icons under the Users folder, you will notice that some subfolders have a shortcut arrow.&nbsp; These arrows indicate a Junction point or Symbolic link.&nbsp; For ordinary mortals stick with the idea that these folders represent shortcuts,
 for example, the 'All Users' settings are now actually stored here --&gt; C:\ProgramData.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></p>
<p><span>All the best!</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 lock screen &#47; login &#47; logon &#47; sometimes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonardo lombardi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 lock screen &#47; login &#47; logon &#47; sometimes doesn&#39;t accept enter key to allow typing of password. Need to click with mouse or press Ctrl&#43;alt&#43;del</h2>
                    <p>So basically every time my windows 10 was locked, before the problem, I would just press the enter key in the keyboard and I would see the password box / sign-in screen / login screen, but after the november 2015 upgrade "<span style="color: rgba(44, 45, 48, 1)">Upgrade
 to Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1511, 10586 </span>" sometimes the enter key doesn't work, nothing happens when I press it, and I have to press the mouse button or &nbsp;ctrl+alt+del or alt+tab to get to the sign-in screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the upgrade, everytime I could just press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to happen after some time that I locked the screen. If I lock and unlock after soon afterward, it always accept the enter key. It seams it looses focus of the screnn, because if i use the alt+tab combination, and them press enter, it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is annoying.</p>
<p>Anyone can help? </p>

            There's a little more to the error message than that, isn't there?<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
That error indicates a problem with the NT File System (NTFS) and you need to start by running a chkdsk /r from the XP Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).<br />
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'd save the file to the Desktop if what you want to do is save a Notepad file to the Desktop location. 
<br />
<br />But if you want to save a shortcut to Notepad to the desktop, instead of simply right clicking it in the Apps list to Pin To Taskbar, then here's how:
<br />
<br />Type Notepad in Start Search, right click result to Open File Location, right click on the Notepad file in the Explorer that opens and choose Send To: Desktop (shortcut).
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            <p>Yes they are 3rd party (not the notifications or notification settings though). The apps i refer to are 'cyber power power panel' (used to monitor my UPS and issues unnecessary battery warnings) and 'malwarebytes anti exploit' (which pushes a notification
 every time i start a web browser). but i dont think the problem is intrinsic to the apps as these are windows notifications that turn on and off just fine but just don't save, they are the only apps that frequently push notifications to the action center,
 bar the mail app. I have no problem with that notifying me though as its useful.
</p>
<p>No the notifications are not the type that offer options, just standard homogeneous Windows notifications displayed in the bottom right and the action center bar on the right.
</p>
<p>Once i turn off notifications for any of the individual apps i don't get more till i restart or log off and on again which clears any changes i made to the notification on/off sliders next to each app picture in settings/system/notification &amp; actions area.
 Note that all other settings save as usual. I haven't checked if the same issue happens on a different account as i have no intention of changing accounts due to the hassle involved. I could try Clean Boot but how will i know its worked if the apps aren't
 running? and correct me if im wrong but if they aren't running i don't think they show up in the notification setting area</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we are not aware of the third party apps and the triggers it might pull off. Clean Boot step might help us ascertain if the issue is confined to one software/app in this case,&nbsp;since you mentioned in your query 'constantly display annoying popups'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot will help not load the app/software. However, the dependent/container apps initiated by this one software will still continue to play in the background if configured in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can be other reasons to this issue as well, Clean boot is just the first point of diagnosis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly keep us posted with the outcomes.</p>

<h2>            What&#39;s the time frame for Windows 10 adding HEIC format Support for Pictures&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently having issues uploading HEIC format pictures to Windows 10 Dropbox via the Cloud coming from an iPhone 8 with iOS 11. The pictures on HEIC format won't upload automatically to Dropbox or if they do I cannot see them on my W10 PC, saying "incompatible
 format". I know there are workarounds on the iPhone by changing the default format or by uploading the files via iTunes with a cable, but I don't want to use those, I want Windows 10 to support the HEIC format as Apple do, as it saves space on my iPhone and
 frankly I don't see why Windows won't support this format? It looks like you are falling behind on this matter</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chatted with someone on MS support and she couldn't answer why or when will Windows 10 support HEIC. She gave me this reference number:&nbsp;<em><span><span>***Personal information deleted by the moderator.</span></span></em><span><span><em>***</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>She

<p>Hi, I contacted support and I was told to write on this forum and put the case number, I did. Now I'm told to go somewhere else with a suggestion. This is not a suggestion, is a must, it is a technical issue because I cannot see certain format on my Windows
 PC and as such you should give me an answer on what are you doing to resolve it. But I can see this issue is just a waste of time with you, I'm extremely disappointing with you right now. Terrible customer service!</p>

<p>I believe the true reason is licensing complexity and too high cost to add HEVC to PCs, not "windows developers".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best solution probably will stay the same as for DVD playback, installing small extra decoders.</p>

</p><p>Something like <a href="https://www.copytrans.net/copytransheic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CopyTrans</a> or similar, if this one will start advertising over time.</p>

</p><p>HEVC videos already play OK with VLC.</p>

    <title>Files to DVD are recorded with Hidden attribute set &#91;possible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mt073  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files to DVD are recorded with Hidden attribute set &#91;possible malware effect&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Several months ago, files that I routinely copied to DVD (such as Quicken BU files) suddenly started being copied with the Hidden file attribute set.&nbsp; It seems that some sort of default setting has been changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's quite possible this is coincidental to a malware attack suffered on my wife's user account on this computer.&nbsp; The attack was cleaned up quite simply with a System Restore to an earlier date.&nbsp; However, she noticed some weeks afterwards that all her jpg
 files in her "My Pictures" folder were gone.&nbsp; They in fact had all been set to Hidden.&nbsp; I have reset them, but I'm wondering if there is something else amiss not accounted for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to check the default settings for file recording on the DVD drive?&nbsp; The hard drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize this is a rather nebulous request, but any assitance is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I did not find this KB document particularly helpful as it was related to READ ONLY and was related&nbsp;to setting or&nbsp;removing&nbsp;(the READ ONLY in this case) attributes.&nbsp; That process&nbsp;I understand.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Perhaps my question was not clear; prior to a few months ago, files I saved to DVD were "normal", no file attributes were set when recorded.&nbsp; Beginning a few months ago, the files I save to DVD are
<u>automatically</u> being recorded with the HIDDEN attribute set.&nbsp;How do I turn this off?&nbsp; Presumably some default setting has been erroneously or surreptitously changed to make the HIDDEN attribute a default event when recording to (at least) this DVD drive,
 I just would like to know how to reset the default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform these methods provided below: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><b>Method 1:</b><br />
&nbsp;</span></div>
<span>
<div><span>Perform System Restore to an earlier point prior to the issue.
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore</a></div>
<div>System Restore can return your system files to a point in time before you noticed a problem, without affecting documents, photos, or other personal files. If System Restore doesn't fix the problem, you can undo the restore operation and choose another
 restore point.</div>

            Sounds like you still have malware on your PC. Try this http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and see if it finds anything. If it doesn't try booting into Safe Mode and try scanning. Trust me, it malware won't just hit one profile, it will hit the machine.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Do you recall when was the last time copy/paste did work ? <br />
Would it be less than 15 days ago ?<br />
If yes, care to do a system restore ?&nbsp; <strong>Pick the date when copy/paste did work as your restore point</strong>.<br />
<span><span>Start button &gt; search box, type system restore &gt;press Enter key &gt; uac prompt &gt; click Choose a different restore point &gt; Next &gt; select the date as your restore point, click it &gt; Next &gt; Finish<br />

    <title>Win 10 updates and Sony Walkman NWZ-WS613 USB connection problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3>    say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 updates and Sony Walkman NWZ-WS613 USB connection problem</h2>
                    After recent Win 10 updates my Sony Walkman NWZ-WS613 devise stopped being recognized by system as USB disc drive. After connecting Walkman to any USB port sound of "USB recognition" may be heard but then after about a second it starts again and again
 and becomes "endless-never-ending-cycling-recognition". Devise is not appeared in device manager but can be recognized as USD disc drive properly on other PCs (running Win Vista and Win 8.1). There are no device issues (yellow 'i') in device manager. Other
 USB devices work properly. I believe this problem is somehow connected to recent Win 10 update. Any suggestions on how to solve it?&nbsp;

            I followed the steps in the article you provided the link to.&nbsp; That really screwed my system up.&nbsp; Couldn't access anything.&nbsp; fortunately I was able to do a safe boot and undo all the things in that article.&nbsp; Now I still have my old next to useless system
 back.&nbsp; Seems like every time I try someone's suggestion, it doesn't fix anything, it only gives me more issues.&nbsp; I even did a restore to the earliest restore point, and I still have all the problems.&nbsp; All this started when I took the free upgrade to windows
 10, decided I didn't like it and went back to windows 8.1.&nbsp; Its been a mess ever since.

 updates installed, Internet Explorer had already frozen up, and the only way to get it to close was using the task manager to end the task.&nbsp; None of the normal closing actions had any effect.&nbsp; Since now upgrading to windows 8.1 again, I haven't noticed this
 problem yet, but then I've been busy installing all the things that went away when I reset my PC, and haven't been using it a lot.&nbsp; This isn't the first time I've reset this computer, but that seems to be the only way to get this thing to work halfway.

<h2>            clean up contacts made duplicates of duplicate numbers in my live mail address book, Win10 64</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 10 64. When I tried to use the clean up contacts option in the live mail address book to delete duplicates, it made duplicates of all of the contacts, including duplicates of duplicates! I thought it was a bug, shut down the PC restarted,
 and tried again. Now I have between 4 to 6 duplicates of every contact! FRUSTRATED!!

    <title>Can&#39;t log in to Windows 10 after restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kerpow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t log in to Windows 10 after restart</h2>
                    <p>So this is how it went:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 on my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. Everything is fine until they had me log in. I typed in my 4 number quick password and then there was a glitch (like after I typed in my 4 number password, the field showed that I typed more than 4) but
 I was able to log in. Everything was fine, the operation ran smoothly and all that jazz. I turned it off and left it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned it on again and now the startup had me log in. Typed my 4 number password and W10 said it was a wrong PIN. I went to the other password option (the one for the long Microsoft password) and typed out. It said
<em>"That password is incorrect. Make sure you're using the password for your Microsoft account. You can always reset it at account.live.com/password/reset."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried it over and over and over again...then I reset my password. Restarted my tab and I still couldn't get in. Contacted Microsoft Chat Help and they told me to wait 2-4 hours so it would fully sync. If it's any help, I waited from 11 PM to 4 PM the next
 day and I STILL can't get in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, all my powerpoints, reviewers and docx are inaccessible just because I can't log in even if my password is the right one. And prelims are next week. Yay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, you need to address this issue. I am very sure i'm not the only one involved in this stupid bug. W10 is great but this whole jig is infuriating. If it's any help, my reference number is&nbsp;1305562190.</p>

            <p>I tried this for a whole WEEK. NOTHING is working! My head hurts because all of the instructions are for conventional laptops and I have to search for hours to find a solution for my tablet and most of them don't even work. I spent too much money shelling
 out for equipment to get the bootable media method to work. My only problem now is to get it to do a PXE boot. The touchscreen wont work in the BIOS and I shelled out money for a mouse and it still won't work (the mouse works in the start up but that's IT)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, I need help. I can't afford to lose my tablet now... My exams are coming and I can't afford to fail just because I can't get pass the log in page.</p>

    <title>Precision Touchpad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ethangs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Precision Touchpad</h2>
                    <p>I just got a Surface Pro 6 and love the precision touchpad gestures, but I want to be able to control the inversion for specific gestures instead of as a whole. For example, I want to scroll normally with 2 fingers (scroll down to go down), but when I switch
 between desktops with 3 fingers or try to use the 2 finger command to switch between pages I want to use the tablet-style inverted gestures. I know that this can be fixed by changing the option for inversion to "down motion scrolls up" in the touchpad settings,
 but then I'm back to the first problem that I want to scroll down to go down like a normal laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this so that my horizontal 2 finger and all-around 3 finger gestures are behaving as if I selected "down motion scrolls up" in the touchpad settings, but my down motion still scrolls down like a normal laptop touchpad.</p>

    <title>WiFi Connection Conflicts with Bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WiFi Connection Conflicts with Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using an Acer Aspire E5-532. I've had several issues with it before, most notably my Bluetooth driver completely disappearing from the PC. I tried checking for hardware changes, making sure it would automatically turn on, etc.. I ended up downloading
 a new driver off the Acer website (Atheros NFA435) and it installed and worked smoothly for about a week. After this period, I began having audio stuttering which escalated to audio cutting out completely or only hearing static. After fiddling with a few settings,
 I discovered that the audio works perfectly when I disable WiFi. However the moment I reconnect, the audio issues return. I tried resetting the router, restarting the laptop and headphones, turning Bluetooth off and on again to no avail. I'm unsure of what
 else to try. Ideas?</p>

<p>I currently have version 1709 (OS Build 16299.15) of Windows 10 installed. When I bought the laptop, Windows 10 was already installed, though I do not know which version it was at that time.&nbsp;</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>

<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release significantly flawed. Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade loses functionality.

            Hi Danielle.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Make sure you have all drivers Updated from the PC's Support Downloads webpage:  BIOS, Chipset, Display, Sound, Bluetooth, Network, etc.   Compare to the installed versions in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />Run the Bluetooth, Sound Playback and Hardware troubleshooters from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If the audio driver is latest, in Device Manager, choose Audio controller, then Driver tab, then uninstall.  Restart to reinstall.  If that fails try rolling it back in same place.
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the problems are caused however by upgrade to the latest version then you can roll back Fall Creators Version 1709 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            Unlock remote display during RDP Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>What settings do I need to change to keep the remote display UNLOCKED while I RDP to it? &nbsp;I want my users to be able to see what I am doing while I am doing it. &nbsp;I have looked for all the settings and do not see anything. &nbsp;I did use the Group Policy editor
 to disable the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that when I RDP to the remote machine (I have Admin rights to it), the screen is still locked, even if I disconnect and leave the display showing!!??</p>
<p>I use this for a computer that displays PowerPoint presentations in our lobby, but overtime I remote to it, it changes to the lock screen and I have to dig out a keyboard and a mouse to plug into the computer in the lobby of the office (which is hidden)
 and then unlock it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I stop this??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            HP LaserJet 1018 - MS Office Connection to Printer Failed</h2>
                    I have Windows 7, and my HP printer worked fine until last week, when I tried to print PDF and Excel file. PDF File did not print at all and my Excel print tab said: "Unable to connect to printer". I tried all the troubleshooting techniques, reinstalling
 the drives from HP website, reconnecting the USB, checked all the Windows updates, and &nbsp;tips to fix it, and nothing worked. Printer can print test page and Notepad texts, but nothing else.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you please advise, as I suspect it has to do with MS Office and Windows compatibility?</div>

            I deleted the drive for 1018 first, then tried the one up - 1020 I think, which worked for a bit.<br />
I reinstalled the 1018 drive from HP website, and it started working. I did many things at once, so not too sure what exactly worked. HP has the maintenance/troubleshooter software which also helps to fix the driver problem here:&nbsp;http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?product=1814094&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=ca&amp;dlc=en&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=ca<br />

Good luck!
