    <title>Error Code 80154002 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fewerthought33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 80154002</h2>
                    
<p>So I've been running around with XBox Support, and Windows Live Support for the past month trying to get a lost password for a Windows Live account.&nbsp; I finally spoke with someone at the corporate office who was able to help me resolve that issue.&nbsp; Just to
 be on the safe side I decided to start up a new Windows Live account and move my gamer tag to that new windows live account, however when I attempt to do this on my XBox I get error code 80154002.&nbsp; So I came here to see if I could find some information out
 in the forums, but when I logged on to the website it tells me my gamer tag is "FewerThought33."&nbsp; This is not my gamer tag. In fact, it seems that the website just created that tag for me for no apparent reason. &nbsp; My gamer tag on my XBox is "fahey."&nbsp; How can
 I change the "fahey" gamer tag from one Windows Live ID to a different one?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greetings, Fewer. Are you encountering any error messages along with the code you are mentioning and if so, at what point does it appear? I would recommend following the steps in the link that Snub posted for how to move your gamertag to a different Windows
 LIVE ID. Give it a shot and let us know if this helps!</p>

<p>I got the same error code of 80154002 as well. &nbsp;I accidentally created a new xbox live account under the wrong profile on our xbox 360 instead of my profile, and, when I went to try and change the user account linked to the profile, I get this error message.
 &nbsp;And I can't find anything online about it either. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><em><strong>Ullyses68</strong></em></span>, &nbsp;these forums work best when you create a new thread with a first post of your own, as the original poster's problem and solution, although similar, could be very different in detail.
 It's great that you're researching here, but the quickest path to a solution is your own thread. &nbsp;That being said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue&nbsp;often is caused by missing proofs or other missing information in your Microsoft Account or Xbox account. &nbsp;I'd go to
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a> and sign in there then click on Edit Security Info to make sure you have a cellphone number, an alternate email address and a security question/secret answer there. After
 you check that, please change your password.</p>

<p>Then, go to <a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> and sign in there, click on My Account, then choose

<h2>            Windows 10 infected with the FBI virus</h2>
                    My laptop is infected with the FBI Ransom Virus. Can anyone tell me how to start Safe Mode in Windows 10 or how to remove this virus? Windows will start but is immediately locked down.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I appreciate your interest on Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand your concern and will surely help you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To fix this issue you need start the computer in Safe Mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers
 aren't causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>In safe mode you will not be able to see a FBI Virus Alert.Now you need to delete the infected files from the following locations.<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>C:\WINDOWS\Temp.</span></strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><strong><span>C:\Users\{Your User Name}\Appdata\Local\Temp</span></strong></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>C:\Users\{Your User Name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</span></strong><strong>
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>There you will be able to see one file called</span><strong><span>ctfmon.lnk.
</span></strong><span>Delete that one from the start up. Now restart the computer…<br />
<br />
Delete all of the files inside the Temporary folder.<br />
<br />
Now restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
After a restart check if you are able to see FBI Virus alert.. If you are still seeing the same pop up's you need to start the computer once again in Safe mode....<br />
<br />
Then GoTo the location <strong><span>C:\Users\{Your User Name}\Appdata\Local\Microsoft\Windows\</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span>There you will be able to see one 4 or 5 digit numbered folder. Delete that one and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also suggest you to refer the article below</span></p>

            <p>I want to thank you Amrita. Although the remedies you suggested were not successful at cleaning the FBI Virus from my machine, they did give me some training in getting around in windows 10. But, after trying your fixes, I chose to reset my computer from
 the factory installed partition. It returned me to the original windows 8.1 that the computer came with. It is working like new again. I appreciate the time and effort you put into your answer.</p>

    <title>How can I combine accounts, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgethomassr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I combine accounts,</h2>
                    <p>This may be confusing, so please bare with me, my original Microsoft account is mu yahoo.com account I used it to sign up a while back, Well I bought this computer about 6 months (or so) ago and when I set it up I started a new account, it was the exact
 same as my yahoo, but had outlook.com at the end, (Example *** Email address is removed for privacy *** : *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)<br />
All was fine, I was having trouble with the HD it kept crashing a lot with the newer builds, now the HD does not work at all, I installed an older one I had and reinstalled windows 10, my outlook I had windows 10 pro, but I don't have the original disk or key,
 so I had to load windows 10 home and my yahoo account was already setup with it so I used that one to resetup my computer...<br />
Well I was playing a game "Sniper Fury" from the windows store on my outlook account and also was connected through facebook on the game, Now when I log in I have been losing progress in the game a lot, example yesterday I gained two new guns and had over 2,000
 rubies, this morning I log in and I did not have the guns and I only had slightly over 800 rubies..<br />
So how do I connect my account from my outlook to my yahoo, and by the way, on the game I can not use microsoft connect only facebook, because microsoft starts me back to the beginning and I am one of the top players (well was on my outlook account)<br />
Sorry if this sounds trivial, but this is the only game I play and I really got into it....&nbsp;<br />
Any help would be appreciated....</p>

            Check with the makers of the hardware (the fingerprint scanner) for an updated version of their driver and/or software.&nbsp; (It's not a Windows issue.)

<h2>            unable to create homegroup windows 10 pro 15063.296</h2>
                    I just finished upgrading my moms laptop to the creators update of windows 10.&nbsp; I am now trying to set up the home group between her computer and mine. Both computers are running windows 10 Pro and on the exact same build/version (15063.296) I am trying
 to set her computer as the host for the homegroup, but on the join/create homegroup screen it says (her computers name) has created a homegroup, and only the join button is available. I tried clicking the join button, to se what would happen, and it asked
 for the homegroup password. I have checked the control panel and explorer. there is no option currently for viewing the homegroup password. I don't know why windows is saying a computer with her PC's name has already created a homegroup when this is false.
 I check the homegroup screen on my PC, and it is nearly identical but says you have been invited to a homegroup.&nbsp;how do I fix this issue?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
In Contana's Search box type Control Panel - find at top of list - Homegroup - there should be a "View the Homegroup password" option there (as well as an option to change the password).
<br />
<br />
If not look for "Leave the HomeGroup" - perform that then when done reboot - do same on ALL computers (and you may need to do this anyway if the password options do not help). Then rebuild the Homegroup starting with the same machine that was first setup on
 the Homegroup&nbsp;before leaving. <br />
<br />
The Homegroup troubleshooter can also be run from there.<br />
<br />
===================<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Start to Finish</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Be sure you have the latest firmware for your router (even if other computers are<br />
working well) and the latest network drivers on the Windows 10 computers.<br />
<br />
<strong>All&nbsp;computers need to have&nbsp;unique names.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>All&nbsp;computers need to have the same time and date.</strong><br />
<br />
Some antivirus/security programs can block or cause networking issues. Disabling a<br />
3rd party antivirus/security program may not be sufficient. You may need to uninstall<br />
it and then run the maker's Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants.&nbsp;Use<br />
Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10&nbsp;is a full&nbsp;antivirus.<br />
<br />
Your router and all computers must be IPv6 capable (hardware, firmware, and drivers)<br />
to use HomeGroup. Check the System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems)<br />
or the actual device makers' sites for update network drivers. Also check the router<br />
maker's site for updated firmware. Check their support and ask in their forums for any
<br />
known issues.&nbsp; (Run the Home Group troubleshooter to enable IPv6.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Try both a wired and wireless connection. Of course update both drivers (see
</strong><br />
last&nbsp;section below). If using a wire now be sure to check cabling.<br />
<br />
<p>Check the Services to be sure they are running :&nbsp; Right Click the TaskBar - Task<br />
Manager - Services tab - at bottom Open Services. Be sure these are correctly<br />
set. Normally ALL are&nbsp;set to Manual and Running.<br />

</span></a><br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager -&nbsp;Network Driver&nbsp;- write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your&nbsp;network adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            I have done all but the driver check. no action was necessary. I did shutdown both mine and my moms PC and then only powered up hers. I was then able to finally create a homegroup. however, as soon as I joined my computer to the homegroup,my moms computer
 (hosting the homegroup) displayed a message in the homegroup saying 'Windows detected another homegroup on your network, you can share.....' (I won't type the rest of the message as it's irrelevant.. The only other PC on the network is a laptop with vista(my
 dad's laptop) which doesn't have homegroup capability. there are no ther homegroups in the network, yet my mom's laptop insists there is. My laptop, does not think there is another homegroup, which is correct. pressing the join now button on my moms laptop
 brings up a password dialog. but since there is no other homegroup, finding the password for this phantom homegroup is impossible. how do I get my moms laptop to quit seeing this phantom homegroup?

            ok, I tried running the homegroup troubleshooter again, and before it got to the part where it asked about the network troubleshooter it fixed *something*, even though it said nothing was wrong at the end. the dialog from my last post changed to the 'homegroup
 is currently sharing libraries on this computer....' message. so I guess... problem solved?

<h2>            After re-boot, I have to enter my password twice on a Windows 10 Desktop PC</h2>
                    <p>A couple of months ago; either after a Windows 10 update or a McAfee update, I have to enter my password twice - every time. This is not a typo situation, I am very concerned about this especially with the recent flaws with Intel chips and other vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9d1a1ade-8380-49ec-b274-ea4c8994c529" title="BettyMayer">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure that you and the person you're calling are using the latest version of Skype. Make sure as well that you have a strong Internet connection, if Skype detects a weak connection it will reduce the call quality. Close other applications that
 could interfere with the connection, such as web browsing and file sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do a test call:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign into Skype for Windows 10</li><li>Search for the <strong>Echo / Sound Test Service</strong> contact.</li><li>Call Echo and follow her instructions.</li></ol>
<p>If you heard Echo’s voice <strong>and </strong>heard your recorded message, then your sound and microphone are working just fine and you are good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to this <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA265/how-do-i-test-my-sound-is-working-in-skype-make-an-echo-test-call?q=test+call" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Same here, the update runs for 16 hours now and is for at least the last 4 hours (after getting up in the morning) stuck at 91%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot use this fix because even if I force a restart I don't get into Windows to do anything. It immediately goes back to the update and to 91%</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really have to let users know these things before they start an update. I have work to do and now I can't do anything. If an update takes more than 30 minutes you have to warn me before I start it. If you know that an antivirus program can interfere
 then you have to let me know to disable it before I start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sitting here looking at a rotating circle when I have work that needed to be done hours ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to wait another 16 hours? Do I need to force several more restarts, potentially breaking something? Do I need to format my hard disk and re-install? What are my options? For disabling the anti-virus it is too late, I can't get there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This appeared to solve my issue (stuck at 91%) too - after three failed attempts, the update installed successfully overnight. In addition to using the trouble shooter as suggested by you and others, I also removed the SD card from the laptop's in-built
 card reader (all other peripherals were unplugged).</p>

<h2>            Windows 7, windows xp, home premium, Music, windows.old, files</h2>
                    
<p>Previously i had "windows xp media center version 2005" installed on my labtop and i installed windows 7 through dell. He did a normal setup and through what i know he made copies of every file. But now when i look through my hard drive i am missing a great
 deal of music files, there are less then half of what i had before. I searched on the internet for possible solutions and to my knowledge there should be a windows.old file... But there is none when i searched my hard drive! I've did an advanced search on
 my computer for some songs i know im missing, but they are no where to be found. Now also i subtracted most of the main files on my computer from the amount is taken, and there is abou 20-25GB&nbsp;of something that i cant find(im guessing my music). So basically
 my question is from reading my problem is there anyway to find some music thats renamed maybe or something that is changed... Thank you very much.</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span><span>Icefire7454,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Since you mentioned that there is a disk space of 20-25GB&nbsp;used up, I’m guessing it is the root drive because
 after performing clean installation, all the personal files should be migrated to a hidden folder at the root of the drive called
<strong><span>Windows.old. </span></strong><strong><span>It is generally located in</span></strong><strong><span>
 C:\Windows.old</span></strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>Configure the folder setting to show hidden files and folders and you should be able to locate it in the root
 drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Alt key, go to Tools &gt; Folder Options</span>
</li><li><span>Go to view tab.</span>
</li><li><span>Under Hidden files and folders, select “<strong>Show hidden files and folders”.</strong></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Now go to the root drive and see if you’re able to locate the windows.old folder. Most programs store a user's
 personal files in the <strong>"Documents and Settings"</strong> folder. Generally, you do not find personal files in the Windows folder or in the Program Files folder. Most personal files are located in folders that are labeled for each user who logged on

    <title>Anyone make a tall piston elevator that works reliably&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Anyone make a tall piston elevator that works reliably&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As far as I can tell, there are three models of piston elevators--the zipper (using stairs attached to sticky pistons), a version that pushed you in a small square upwards, and a version where you stand between two pistons and move straight upwards.&nbsp; I am
 trying to build a functioning elevator that can reliably take me up 70 blocks from bedrock to surface.&nbsp; I made a full zipper elevator at that height, but it was extremely unreliable and worked only 5% of the time due to piston glitches.&nbsp; The big problem there
 is that when it works up to a certain height and then fails, you drop to your death.&nbsp; So it was more of a suicide machine than an elevator.&nbsp; Now I'm once bitten, twice shy. It seems that the pistons on the Xbox 360 version are too unreliable to make an elevator
 that is both functioning and reliable.&nbsp; Has anyone overcome this inherent unreliability in the pistons themselves to make a piston elevator that actually works at significant height and does so consistently?</p>

<p>Obviously I already did that, as I noted in my post the three kinds of piston elevators that have historically been made. &nbsp;99% of those videos are on the PC version, where the pistons are not as glitchy (some of those videos say "works on xbox," although
 the video was clearly shot while playing on PC and the comments often reflect that the designs do not, in fact, work on the Xbox). &nbsp;The 1% of videos regarding piston elevators made on the Xbox 360 reflect that the elevators made in the videos are both completely
 unreliable (it often takes the player a few tries to get up to the top--which can be fatal for tall elevators, the subject of this post) and relatively close to the ground.</p>

<p>Downspin18, thanks for the video link. &nbsp;I've seen Minecraft ladders before. &nbsp;It's a cool concept, but I'm trying to see if I can create a tall and reliable working elevator with pistons. &nbsp;At this point, I don't think its possible, but I'd be curious if anyone
 has been able to accomplish that feat.</p>

<p>You might get it to work sometimes but the lag of mp makes piston elevators unreliable. Even if there is something that works it will get broken in future updates. The minecart one will work until the minecarts decide to glitch into the wall or fall through
 the ladders, but this type is really fast. Another good one to build is a boat elevator. Like the minecarts, boats can get pretty glitchy at times too.</p>

<p>The minecart "elevator" doesn't work on xbox anymore after the update they did in april, I had one and after the update ladders and signs won't hold the cart in place anymore they just slide right though it.</p>

<p>Globalization doesn't mean you can change your region on the fly</p>
<p>You can however comply with your local laws and create a account in your actual region</p>
<p>This is with every online service </p>
<p>When you want to change server or region you do need to astart a new character or an different account</p>
<p>Credit cards can only be billed to the region they were billed from </p>
<p>Any attempt to charge otherwise will set off fraud flags</p>

<p>Globalization actually refers to the increase of global relationships of culture, people and economic activity (Wikipedia) and this is what is happening here. That way I can have an XBOX in my country and play around the world.</p>
<p>I can perfectly understand that legal issues can raise if you give everyone in the world with a credit card to get a game, so sounds fair that this is restricted.</p>
<p>Anyway this is just a principles cause. I just want to see my profile updated with the reality, I'm argentinian and would like to see it reflected in my profile.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live downloads being throttled or bottlenecked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live downloads being throttled or bottlenecked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking this up around the web for quite a bit and see a lot of folks in a similar situation, but can't seem to find a conclusive answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My downloads/updates on xbox live seem to throttled by MS and not my ISP or a lack of bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, I have a fiber connection, and when I initiate a download, the speed starts out fast (~90mb/s) then within the first minute or so drops off to less than 5mb/s, and often will hover around 1.5 - 2mb/s for the entirety of the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>THE SPECS:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a single-user, high-speed, network with 4 devices connected (including my xbox).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All devices have strong uninterrupted bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a Google mesh wifi router in a single room building with direct line of sight to all devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Router report shows average&nbsp;down speed ~572mb/s and average up speed ~834mb/s (at the router).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speed test on the xbox (wifi) during the last update showed a speed of 82mb/s (down) and 91.4 mb/s (up)</p>
<p>
</p><p>ISP is not comcast&nbsp;and not in the habit of throttling or capping data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>THE QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Is MS throttling download speeds intentionally or unintentionally?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the result of bottlenecking from too many concurrent users downloading from the same server (I imagine the initial spike in download speed makes a good case here?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, is there a way to switch download servers&nbsp;mid download?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there additional settings in my xbox to take advantage of this lost bandwidth?</p>
<p>
</p><p>@MS can't Azure do better than this? I'm in your backyard and it took an hour to update a six-year-old game last night on a fiber network. Hardly the future of entertainment you promised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            It may&nbsp;have something to do with your area&nbsp;possibly. My net is at 160 Mbps and if no one else is using the net I get 140-160 Mbps. Even with my whole family streaming, I'm still above 100mbps consistently.&nbsp;

<p>Hello!<br />
</p>
<p>I would guess there's some sort of ISP or connection issue you're experiencing.&nbsp; If it's consistently happening, it's possibly even an issue from your ISP to Microsoft, which usually your provider would have to resolve.&nbsp; I have a 100Mbps connection with
 multiple devices, and typically have download speeds around 60-70Mbps on my Xbox.</p>

<p>Hi Paul-</p>
<p>
</p><p>The console has been set up on wifi for the past 5 months. However, previously, this had been a recognizable issue on a wired connection in another setup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before, I was a comcast&nbsp;user with a significantly slower package (max 60mb speeds). Typically, my up/down speeds with a wired connection straight to the xbox&nbsp;would plateau, again, around 5-8mb/s. I had tried swapping cables several times, but because my
 internet experience with comcast&nbsp;typically showed that speeds on all my devices seldom ever lived up to promised speeds, I didnt associate the xbox live with throttling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward to a new apartment, new ISP, new router... I have far more visibility on my network health and ISP, and far more bandwidth. So the performance dip here on xbox live is far more easy to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to your other questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network tests on Xbox show ALL GOOD:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, the last check showed </p>
<p>down speed ~102mbps</p>
<p>up speed ~103mbps</p>
<p>Latency 24ms</p>
<p>Wireless strength 100%</p>
<p>packet loss 0%</p>
<p>MTU 1480</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not prioritized the console on the network, but when I'm running an update or download on my xbox, I'm not multitasking on other devices. And with fiber bandwidth of over 500mbps down, it sure seems like I ought to be pulling in higher download speeds
 than 5mb/s from xbox, especially when the console still reads data streams coming in around 100.</p>

<p>Thank you for responding so quickly to the message. When you see the plateau how far are you along with the update? Is it possible the slow rate you see might be the transfer/write rate from the hard drive? As well once you prioritize the console on the
 network please let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Thanks Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically, the speed starts off strong... full speed within the initial 30 seconds to one minute or so. That's an estimate. It's pretty inconsistent. I have had some updates stay consistently strong for 75-80% of the download then plummet for the remainder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost always tho, once the speed lowers, it never recovers back to initial speeds.</p>

<h2>            cannot start bfe service access denied error 5</h2>
                    <p>I am on a brand new laptop running Windows 7 SP1</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a Windows update, lost internet connectivity and firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp; After much looking up of various error numbers, etc. on this support site, I have identified that the ICS service isn't working anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; More investigation showed that the BFE service was
 totally missing, hence the problem with connectivity and firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-imported the bfe.reg&nbsp;file into the register and it is now showing in my services again, but when I try to start it I get&nbsp; "Error 5: access denied"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried a SCF scan and there is nothing wrong.&nbsp; I have also tried to restore the system to before the windows update, with no luck, the system says due to an unindentifiable error, the restoration could not complete.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no other point
 of restoration, since this is a new laptop.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
</span><span><br />
1. Do you receive any error message?<br />
2. Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
</span><span><br />
BFE ties into many other features besides the firewall, and may even be required for a third-party firewall to function properly. I would recommend keeping this service enabled.</span>
<p><b><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></b><span>You may </span><span>try disabling the security software and check.<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 2:<br />
</b>You may<b> </b>run the fix <span>&nbsp;</span>it provide and check:<b><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_security_diagnostic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_security_diagnostic/</a></b></span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 3:<br />
</span></b><span>You may follow the steps provide and check:<br />
a. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\BFE<br />
b. Right click on it-<strong><span>permissions</span></strong><br />
c. Click on <strong><span>ADD </span></strong>and type<br />
d. Everyone and click ok<br />

<li>The system has been scanned for viruses and is clean.</li><li>A known good version of the BFE registry key from a functional server (this is on a W2K8R2 server 64 bit) has been imported.</li><li>the NT Service\BFE has been added to security.</li><li>Permissions have been set to "Full" for the registry key.</li><li>Downloading and implementing a third party software is not allowed (nor should it be needed).<br />
</li><li>I've also tried a few other things that would not normally seem to be related. (don't ask).
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Suffice it to say that if it has been mentioned more than three times in a Google/Bing search, I have tried it. ... Please note that rebuilding the OS is NOT an option nor should it be required. This is just a service and should have the ability to be removed/updated/re-added
 etc. without wiping the hard drive. ... Such a solution should be deemed unacceptable by any tech worth their cert!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, given the above, I will be open to exploring possible solutions. I need something with some serious meat on the bones to put forward to the System Admins.<br />

</p><blockquote><span>Hi,<br />
</span><span><br />
1. Do you receive any error message?<br />
2. Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
</span><span><br />
BFE ties into many other features besides the firewall, and may even be required for a third-party firewall to function properly. I would recommend keeping this service enabled.</span>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></strong><span>You may </span><span>try disabling the security software and check.<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may<strong> </strong>run the fix <span>&nbsp;</span>it provide and check:<strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_security_diagnostic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_security_diagnostic/</a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method 3:<br />
</span></strong><span>You may follow the steps provide and check:<br />
a. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\BFE<br />
b. Right click on it-<strong><span>permissions</span></strong><br />
c. Click on <strong><span>ADD </span></strong>and type<br />
d. Everyone and click ok<br />
e. Now Click on Everyone<br />
f. Below you have <strong><span>permission for users</span></strong><br />
g.Select full control and click ok<br />
h. Now, open <strong><span>RUN </span></strong>and type<br />
i. <strong><span>services.msc</span></strong> and click ok<br />
j. Start base filtering engine service and then windows firewall service <br />
</span><strong><span><br />
</span><span>Important: </span></strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article below:<br />

</p><p>None of these options work with Windows 8, Does anyone know of a fix for this? Surely Microsoft should be able to sort their act out to share an Internet connection ??</p>

            <p>Solved all my services "error 5: acces denied " by doing this : icacls %windir%\system32 /Grant:r administrators:f /T /C /Q</p>
<p>then icacls %windir%\system32 /Grant:r system:f /T /C /Q</p>
<p>and for future peace : icacls %windir%\system32 /grant:r trustedinstaller:f /T /C /Q (because, as usual, errors 5 appeared after a security update ) .</p>

            I understand how/why that works however anyone would agree thats not a good solution because of the security compromise on the system32 folder/files by granting those permissions. I'm going to check newer threads which hopefully have more of a real world
 solution than that. I am not dissing the solution as stupid, and in fact it is great to be resourceful and creative to be able to find solutions to problems, even if not ideal/secure.

    <title>Partition Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macoveitudor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Partition Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a little problem with my Hard-Drive.</p>
<p>I installed Ubuntu 16 LTS on a 20gb partition. After that, I installed Windows 8.1 in a 30gb partition, and formated the rest of the remaining space (400gb) in a NTFS partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I killed Ubuntu, from Windows, and that partition that Ubuntu used, remained as free space. Neither the Disk Management or the Windows installation disk can't create a partition. When I try to install Windows directly on that free space it says: "Can't
 create partition. Error: 0x8004240f".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do now is to reinstall Windows 8.1 on that 30gb partition, and make dual-boot with a Windows 7 Ultimate, which I want to install on that previous Ubuntu partition.</p>
<p>*I don't want to lose any data from the 400gb partition.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sound like if it's Free space that it is Logical, so it needs to be deleted again in Disk Management to become Unallocated Space that can be absorbed into either of the other Primary partitions using Disk Management if it's to the right, or a partition Manager like Easeus if it's to the left. Easeus can also convert it from Logical Free Space to Unallocated.  Disk management can only delete the Volume which creates Free Space, and then delete the partition which creates Unallocated needed.  
<br />
<br />If you need further help please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which we read like a doctor reads X-rays:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I believe Easeus treats Logical like Primary so you can probably Resize into the Free Space from C or Data partition either way.  <a href="https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager-guide/resize-and-move-partition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager-guide/...</a>
<br />
<br />Or here is conversion tutorial:  <a href="https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager-guide/convert-logical-partition-to-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager-guide/...</a>

<br />If any problems post the requested screenshot as it specifies and I'll read it in the morning.
