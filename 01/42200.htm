            Hi  YeLin 
<br />
<br />If your computer managed within an organization?
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did this behavior start recently?  If so can you System Restore to a point before it happened?  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then try updating your Sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  
<br />
<br />Run the Sound Recording and Playback troubleshooters at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Does the problem happen on another PC using the same headset?  
<br />
<br />Try creating a new test Local Admin Account to sign into see if the problem happens:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then move into the new account and when ready delete the old one in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />If so then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Mic
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level

    <title>Recovering the Windows Live Mail database... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recovering the Windows Live Mail database...</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I hope somebody can help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 and it is currently updated as of today 29 August 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of 27th August 2014, I have been unable to open WLM to access my email. I keep getting a dialog box with "Recovering the Windows Live Mail database..." and then another pops up stating WLM has stopped working and the only option is to click 'close'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have come across several solutions and have tried them all, from creating a fixkey.reg file to uninstalling and/or repairing the WLM. Nothing seems to work. Not even a fresh installation of the Windows Live Essentials (complete) after not having it for
 2 days on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access my emails via Outlook that is integrated into my system, however, it is not always up to date, and syncing doesn't always work, unless I log into my Hotmail account via IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather prefer to be able to use the WLM application as I find it easier and better than using Outlook (integrated software) or via IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any help or can offer tips that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps you have stated did nothing to help WLM start correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using WLM 2012, as it is the latest version online to download. However, as of this very moment (29/8/14 19:23GMT)&nbsp;I think I may have got it working after I searched my WIN8.1 search engine&nbsp;and found this article:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.vistax64.com/live-mail/188023-windows-live-mail-database-recovery-restore-failed.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the second entry and with a little patience and searching through the system files, I found what it said and is currently syncing. I will post an update and the section of the article I used in full if it is successful.</p>

            <p>As stated in my previous update, I shall now post the sections I used from the article I found as it was the only thing that was entirely relevant to the issue I had:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that your WLMail database is corrupted but WLMail was unable to recover it from a backup, or do a full recovery for some reason.<br />
<br />
There are several things you can try, so I will mention a couple from the least to most dramatic. I won't bother you with Esentutl though, since replacing the database is a better option I think.<br />
<br />
First though, to be certain your messages remain safe, please make a backup/copy of your WLMail Message Store*.<br />
<br />
1. Restore the database backup:<br />
<br />
Close WLMail.<br />
<br />
Navigate to your WLMail Message Store folder*.<br />
<br />
Within it, you will find the database file called 'Mail.MSMessageStore'. After ensuring that the backup** of the database is in place within the folder Backup\new, delete the database file 'Mail.MSMessageStore'.<br />
<br />
Restart WLMail.<br />
<br />
When WLMail is restarted, it should automatically restore the database file from the backup. A few messages within the Message Store may be 'recovered' during the process and moved to a folder called 'Recovered items' under 'Storage folders'.<br />
<br />
If the problem remains:<br />
<br />
2. Force a full recovery of database and messages:<br />
<br />
During a full recovery, your database will be re-created, and all your folders/messages will be moved into subfolders of a folder called 'Recovered items' under 'Storage folders'.<br />
<br />
Close WLMail.<br />
<br />
Navigate to your WLMail Message Store folder*.<br />
<br />
Within it, you will find the database file called 'Mail.MSMessageStore'. Delete the backup of the database within the folder Backup\new (if a recent compaction of the database has occurred, this backup may not exist).<br />
<br />
Delete the database file 'Mail.MSMessageStore'.<br />
<br />
Restart WLMail.<br />
<br />
When WLMail is restarted, it will automatically re-create the database file, and all e-mail messages within the Message Store will be 'recovered' and moved to appropriately named subfolders within a folder called 'Recovered items' under 'Storage folders'.<br />
<br />
Be aware that any messages left on your Mail Service Provider's server for a POP3 account, may be re-downloaded.<br />
<br />
You should wait for the new database to index all your relocated messages (may take hours, with high processor usage) before beginning to move them out of the 'Recovered items' folder.<br />
<br />
Do not move any folders out of the 'Recovered' items folder. Rather, create a new folder in the desired location and move the recovered messages into it.<br />
<br />
You can delete the 'Recovered items' folder when you have moved all of the messages out of it, but be aware that doing so will break the Quick views. To repair the Quick views, see
<a href="http://liveunplugged.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!F92775FC46A390CA!205.entry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
<br />
*Note that Windows Live Mail's Message Store, in its default location, is a hidden folder, so ensure "Show hidden files and folders" is checked under Folder Options in Windows Explorer.<br />
<br />
The default location for XP is: C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;USER_NAME&gt;\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail<br />
<br />
<br />
**After deleting the database file, as long as there is a backup of the database file 'Mail.MSMessageStore' within the ...Backup\new folder, the database will simply be restored from the backup with minimal drama upon next restart of WLMail. However, if that
 backup has not yet been created, such as after a database compaction has recently occurred, then a *full* recovery of the database and messages/folders will occur.<br />
<br />
<br />
The above solutions would normally repair problems associated with the database.</p>

            <p>I found my emails under "Recovered items/12-30-2104 823/storage Folders" and inside this folder is all my saved emails inside their respective folders categories with an alpha-numeric and .eml (I assume that's the actual email). I can actually view them
 if I go through all the subfolders from C:XX/XX/XX/XX/XX/XX/XX.eml, you get the idea...So how to I get these subcategories emails back into my Windows Live Mail account when I open my email so I can view them like before from WLM??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

<p>I'm using Windows 8.1 with WLM 2013 and it works each time this problem has occurred (which in the last 18 months is twice)... so it does appear to be generic. However, different operating systems (Granted) will have different workarounds. Seeing as I have
 not seen an answer from Microsoft themselves - everyone is out for self help and advice. So if my advice has helped people then that's all good and well. However, should the problem be different - then a separate question should be asked. But, and I say that
 BUT lightly, in 95% of all cases with WLM - the solution I posted will work. On rare occasions it will be something different. I originally found my answer on google... and copied it to text and saved it for future reference... I hope it helps people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to note is that on rare occasions, WLM certificate will expire and require Microsoft to update or create a new one and this will automatically be downloaded. Should that fail, i would suggest logging in to Hotmail/Outlook etc online to see
 if you can still access your emails. Then try uninstalling your current WLM, downloading the new WLM directly from Microsoft and re-install it and try again. Take note of any errors that appear and post them in the relevant forums on Microsoft...</p>

            <p>Hello. This post was very useful. </p>
<p>This window "Recovering Widows Live mail database" started poping up all of a sudden every time I launch WLM, ad since, I couldn't receive any mail on any account (Pop3).
</p>
<p>I followed your procedure, <span><span>erased the Mail.MSMessageStore files (make a copy on an external HD).</span></span></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><span>And this time, when I&nbsp; restart WLM, it works ! I receive all the messages storaged on my webmail servers.</span></span></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span><span>The problem that still remains : how do I get back my archives ? The messages storaged on the Mail.MSMessageStore that I deleted ? I can reinstall it form the HD back up, but then, I will have 2 files with the same function ..
 What it's going to do ? I don't know ..</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I lost all the subfolders that I had before, and don't have any

<p><span><span>Any idea ? </span></span></p>

    <title>Problem Playing MP4 Videos on Windows 7 via MCI Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sparkz42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem Playing MP4 Videos on Windows 7 via MCI Drivers</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 x64 which I want to play HD mp4 videos via a MCI device (MPEGVideo).
<br />
<br />
The videos in question play fine directly through WMP 12 but when playing via MCI from a program I just get&nbsp; "cannot determine the device type from the given filename extension" error. Other videos types play ok via MCI. I've also tried this on a new installation
 of Windows 7 with the same problem.<br />
<br />
I've tried 3rd party codecs but it didn't make any difference. I assume this is either a configuration issue, bug or MCI just can't handle it?<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to get this working?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Mark<br />

            The files in question play fine through Windows Media Player if play them directly. They just won't play via the MCI route which gives programs control over WMP.<br />
<br />
I should mention, my MP4 files are HD 1920x1080.<br />

<p>Exactly what is suppose to be classic about this? It offers very little gameplay variation from the base game, which plays like every other Halo, except the original. Even worse, no one ever votes for classic CTF, which is the mode that made the first Halo
 a hit online.</p>

<p>The original Halo was played online through Xbox Connect. What is a classic map to them? Stuff from a game that was just released not that long ago. C'mon. I thought I'd have a classic style gameplay option, but I guess not.</p>

<h2>            I don&#39;t know what to do anymore</h2>
                    <p>Basically I hate windows 10 and wanted to go back to windows 7, sadly windows doesn't want to cooperate with me. I want a clean install so all my files and settings would get removed and/or reset which is totally fine. Sadly windows 10 does not like me,
 I've been stuck at winver 1607 for months, maybe a year. I tried everything, someone from microsoft even got access to my computer and did some stuff, he told me to reboot my pc and all my issues will be resolved. Sadly after the reboot it said error and stuff
 so basically I'm still at winver 1607, updates do not work manually or automatic. He gave me a software to ignore updates, which does not work. Every single day I reboot my pc, it updates for an hour, says error and then uninstalls the updates which takes
 another hour. I've tried to re-install w10 with an USB, I got the purple screen and all, but when it reached 100% it said error and all I can do is press OK and it reboots and I can wait an hour for the not-working updates. I went to the advanced boot options
 and clicked Troubleshooting &gt; Re-install computer and wait several hours. After those several hours it said error and no changes were made. Also tried normal troubleshooting, of course that didn't help anything. Rollback pc with restore points? They do not
 work and they even get deleted after it says error. Went from trouble shooting &gt; command prompt and opened the setup.exe there. It opened, but after it reaches 100% it said error. I can't formatt the C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to install windows 7 but I can't even re-install windows 10</p>

<p>You may be able to run a virtual windows XP machine inside of win 10 if your hardware supports it</p>

            Notepad is for text files only (using a fixed width font to display text). The pen will only work to move the cursor around, not to draw anything.

    <title>Call of Duty Ghosts - xbox one and xbox 360 prepaid code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ash racer 5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call of Duty Ghosts - xbox one and xbox 360 prepaid code</h2>
                    
<p>I've just bought a prepaid code for Call of Duty Ghosts from amazon, saying that it is an xbox one and xbox 360 combo. I'm not really fussed about the xbox 360 version, as I only wanted it on the xbox one for a cheap-ish price.</p>
<p>I entered the code on the xbox one, which redirected me to the website. I tried to redeem the code on xbox.com, entered the code correctly and it acknowledged that it was the Call of Duty Ghosts pre-paid code. I clicked accept and then it stated that 'something
 went wrong'. Suggesting that I try again, I did so, several times over the space of a couple of hours. It then suggested looking at the error code which is&nbsp;<span>0x80153016. This error is when something on the marketplace has supposedly changed and offers
 help from the 360. Sadly, this is no help to me as I am trying to get the code to work on my xbox one, by going through xbox.com.</span></p>
<p><span>If anyone could think of a solution to this, it would be of great help.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>

    <title>UIMain.exe Freezes on Windows 10 Pro Version 1703 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billsmart  say:</h3>
<h2>            UIMain.exe Freezes on Windows 10 Pro Version 1703</h2>
                    <p>I have a USB modem that uses UIMain.exe to start the application. I've used this for several years and with Windows 10 Pro when I upgraded to it many months ago. I recently upgraded Windows 10 Pro to version 1703, and now the USB modem will not freezes when
 it tries to start. I've checked with TaskManager and the program that freezes in UIMain.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've turned off my virus checkers (Windows Defender and SpyHunter), but that did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched online and have tried deinstalling and reinstalling the software. I've tried installing the software by changing the compatibility of the install .exe to Windows 8 and Windows 7. I've tried changing the compatibility on UIMain.exe to Windows 8
 and Windows 7, but was not allowed to change that in the Properties/Compatibility panel, but was able to do that using Windows Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any other suggestions, other than falling back to my previous version of Windows 10 Pro - whatever that was?</p>

<p>Hello Bill, <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue as such can be a result of either compatibility issue or software limitation. To better assist you with your concern, we'd like to verify if the source of the re-installed software came from the manufacturer's website or via offline installer. To get
 assistance on updating your USB modem, we recommend that you get in touch with the provider of it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back for additional help.</p>

<p>Zedrick, Thanks for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation software exists on the USB drive itself which is admittedly several years old, but I want to stress that this software worked on my previous version of Windows 10 Pro, and works today on my friend's version of Windows 10 (I don't know the
 version number) and my&nbsp;other laptop which is running Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something was changed in Windows 10 Pro Version 1703 which is prohibiting the execution of UIMain.exe. It's easy for you to say it's the other party's software's fault. That's not a convincing conclusion and certainly not a solution for my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you Bing UIMain.exe Windows 10 you'll see lots of people who are having this same problem. I'm going to keep looking for a solution. If I find one I'll post it here.</p>

<p>Zedrick, Thanks for not giving up on helping me with this problem. I have made no progress at all, but do now have a plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The version of Window's 10 Pro on which this aircard using UIMain.exe will load is 1607.</p>
<p>- The installer application comes pre-installed on the aircard which is marked by TrueMove, the largest Thai telecommunications company. The installer itself, and the version of UIMain.exe used, is made my the ZTE Corporation, a large company that creates
 all kinds of telecommunications software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to 1703 because I thought it was the next version of Windows 10 Pro. The more I read about it I now think it is just a different version of Windows Pro and not necessarily the best version for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link I found that has a little bit of information on the different versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/support-for-windows-10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live way up in the mountains of Central Thailand, and my only access to the internet is via an aircard, unless I install a satellite dish. True has a mobile broadcast tower about a kilometer down the mountain from me and I get good reception. The other
 service's aircard which I am using now doesn't get as good reception. My tentative plan now is just to revert back to 1607 because using this&nbsp;aircard&nbsp;is important to me.&nbsp;What do you think about that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...Bill!</p>

<p>Zedrick, (or whoever can help me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to find a way to send you a private message but didn't see how. Anyway, I just wanted your expert advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning on going back to Windows Pro 1607. I only "upgraded" to 1703 because I thought it was the next release. Now I find out it's not exactly that. It's just a different version. From what I can tell 1607 has more of what I need, and if UIMain.exe
 is compatible with 1607 I definitely want to return to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't think there's any easy way, like finding a "fallback" button that will magically re-install 1607.</p>
<p>- I've searched my PC and don't didn't find any directors with another version of Windows 10. (I did, however, find a directory for Windows 7, but it was empty.)</p>
<p>- I've&nbsp;found the following link from which I could download an ISO file with an "Anniversary" version of 1607, but I don't know if this is Windows 10 Pro, which is what I have because I upgraded to it from Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp;http://windowsiso.net/windows-10-iso/windows-10-anniversary-update-1607-download-build-14393-0/windows-10-anniversary-update-1607-iso-download-standard/</p>
<p>- Also, I think I need some kind of special software to work with an ISO file. I've found some information here&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>- And lastly, I can't find my Windows 10 Pro Product Key. My system information has a link which would allow me to change that, but I didn't want to click on that for fear it would delete my existing key. I've been told that Windows 10 keys are not linked
 to the device, like my PC, so I shouldn't worry about that - but I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically, I'm asking you to give me detailed instructions on how to "fallback" (or re-load) a version of Windows 10 Pro Version 1607. Or maybe you could just point me to a website that has that information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate it. I need to get this USB modem that uses UIMain.exe to work. It's very important to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...Bill Smart</p>

<p>Some drivers may not work after the update to the latest build version of Windows due to compatibility, unless the driver's manufacturer will provide or create an update for that certain driver to be compatible to it. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to
 revert back to the previous build version for your USB modem to work. To be guided on this, we recommend that you follow the steps provided under

<p>Zedrick, Thanks for your reply, but that won't work for me. I've waited too long and no longer have the Go Back option, and I don't want to do a backup, complete install of 1607, and then a restore. I'm not that brave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...I'll guess I'll just have to keep poking around for a solution.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title says, the latest update has made a 400 mb H: drive on my computer and windows is constantly telling me its running out of space.&nbsp;&nbsp; There isn't a thing on the drive, hidden or otherwise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to either remove this phantom drive or tell windows to calm down and stop telling me every 20 min its low on space.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Mg1316, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume H
<br />
<br />remove letter=H
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

<h2>            I get a blue screen when trying to run Flight Simulator X.</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;I GET THE BLUE SCREEN AS WELL WHEN I TRY TO RUN FSX GOLD EDITION ON WINDOWD 7 64-BIT</div>
I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED OF MICROSOFT PRODUCTS CRASHING ALL THE TIME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT MICROSOFT PRODUCT IS SO EXPENSIVE IT MALFUNCTIONS OR CRASHES.
<br />
<br />
I'M GOING BACK TO VISTA BECAUSE I HATE WINDOWS 7. I'VE RECEIVED THE BLUE SCREEN OVER 23 TIMES TODAY AND EXTREMELY SICK OF THIS. MY COMPUTER HAS CRASHED TODAY AND NOW I HAVE TO REINSTALL EVERYTHING ALL OVER AGAIN. I RECEIVED THIS CODE 0X0000007F FOR THE CRASH
 DUMP. I JUST INSTALLED MICROSOFT FSX GOLD EDITION TODAY BUT HAVE NOT INSTALLED THE DRIVERS FOR MY GRAPHIC CARDS AND HAD RECEIVED THE BLUE SCREEN SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL I WENT ONLINE TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE WAS GETTING THE BLUE SCREEN WHEN TRYING TO RUN FSX. I DECIDED
 TO UPDATE MY VIDEO CARD DRIVERS FROM ATI AND ONCE I DID THAT I WAS PROMPT IN RESTARTING MY COMPUTER. ONCE I WAS LOGGED BACK IN I OPENED FSX AND RECEIVED AN ERROR CODE FROM FSX THAT MY VIDEO CARD DOES NOT SUPPORT PIXEL SHADER AND I NEED A GEFORCE 9800 GRAPHICS
 CARD. A SECOND LATER RECEIVED THE BLUE SCREEN AGAIN. I LOGGED BACK INTO WINDOWS AND UNINSTALLED THE ATI DRIVERS RESTARED MY COMPUTER. WHEN I RAN FLIGHT SIMULATOR X AGAIN I RECEIVED THE SAME MESSAGE ABOUT THE PIXEL SHADER AND FSX WAS FORCED TO SHUT DOWN FSX.
 FROM THIS POINT ON I WAS UNABLE TO OPEN FSX AND MY COMPUTER WAS GETTING THE BLUE SCREEN CONSISTANTLY. I DECIDED THAT MY COMPUTER HAD CRASHED AND LOST ALL OF MY FILES PICTURES AND MUSIC AND HAD TO REINSTALL WINDOWS 7. I DO HAVE A OVERCLOCKING SYSTEM. I HAVE
 THE INTEL I7-920 PROCESSOR AT 2.667MHz OVERCLOCKED IT TO 4.027 MHz, ASUS RAMPAGE II EXTREME MO, CORSAIR DOMINATOR GT 4GB AND 2 ATI HD 4870 X2 GRAPHIC CARDS RUNNING XFIRE OR QUAD FIRE A TOTAL OF 4 GPU'S NOT OVERCLOCKED! 2 WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DRIVES RAID 0.
 I DON'T THINK OVERCLOCKING MY COMPUTER HAD TO DO WITH THIS BECAUSE WHEN I HAD IT OVERCLOCKED IN VISTA, IT WAS FINE UNTIL WINDOWS 7 CAME A LONG. I'VE ALREADY SOLD MY WINDOWS VISTA ULTIMATE RED EDITION AND WISH I NEVER SOLD IT.

<p>I was able to solve my FSX BSOD problem by removing my Diamond sound card.&nbsp; I'm using the sound onboard my XFX mobo now.&nbsp; My BSOD problem with FSX started after I had upgraded from SLI XFX 8800GT gpu's to a GFX 250.&nbsp; At the same time I added a Diamond 7.1
 sound card.&nbsp; Under that configuration as soon as I pushed the throttle forward on any plane I would hear a loud buzz then get the BSOD.&nbsp; I tried removing my memory, swapping back to my old graphics card, updating my mobo bios but all no joy, still BSOD.&nbsp; I
 gave up and unloaded FSX.&nbsp; Then recently I read in a FSX forum that the error I was having may be due to a conflict with the sound memory.&nbsp; On a hunch I removed my sound card, reloaded FSX Acceleration and have been running fine since.&nbsp; I've completed several
 missions and logged 20hrs without a single BSOD error.&nbsp; My sound is fine set to 2.1 stereo (I gave up on porting 5.1 thru my home theatre stereo).</p>

    <title>Restore file to Windows 10 Quick Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill832  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore file to Windows 10 Quick Access</h2>
                    I accidently&nbsp;removed a file used daily from the Recent Files section of Quick Access. I'd like to have it back in the Recent Files section to make it easily accessible, but opening and closing it does not return it there. Is there a way to allow this file
 back in Quick Access or is it forever banished?

            Best I've been able to determine, the action is by design and there is no way to unflag a file from being removed from Quick Access once you remove it.

            Finally uncovered a way to restore a file to QuickAccess that was acceptable to me. If you go to view/options and clear history, removed files will return to QuickAccess. The negative is you've removed everything except pinned items&nbsp;from QuickAccess until
 you open them again and you have restored everything you have removed from showing up in QuickAccess.

<h2>            Paint Tool SAI and Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    I have recently been looking for a good art program for my surface and paint tool SAI has taken my interest. I have seen other people use the program on different laptops or computers with a drawing tablet. But with the pen and touch screen feature on
 my laptop, would I still need to purchase a tablet or will I be fine using the program with the pen the laptop comes with?

            <p>Hi SherrillWilliams,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your concern about still getting a pop up window that asked you to sign in everytime you are on your Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reconfigure your account to reset on its default settings. Refer to this article below.</p>

<br />
Signing in has nothing to do with being able to read, receive or send mail. It determines which contacts list and calendar to load. It also allows you to send photo email if you want to.<br />
<br />
When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. On the <em>Connection
</em>tab, click <em>Stop signing in</em>. Accept the warning, then close down Windows Live Mail. Wait a few minutes, then start the program again; you should not see the sign-in dialogue.
<br />
<br />
You can now use the right-most button on the <em>Home</em> tab of the ribbon to sign in if you want to use the contacts and calendar associated with your Microsoft Account. If you select
<em>Remember me and sign me in automatically</em>, you should not have to enter your credentials each time you start the program.<br />
<br />

            That is an entirely different problem. Please do again whatever you did to produce that error, then click on the error message to select it. You can then use right-click to copy it and paste it into your reply here. There can be no troubleshooting without
 seeing the entire error message.

            Hi Afsana
<br />
<br />You have no need to be worried about these folders, they are not caused by malware, they can be created by many applications on your PC, they are very common names for folder creation
<br />
<br />To find out the exact application that is creating these folders, where exactly on your hard drive are those two folders located?
        </p>

            I recommend switching to a 3rd party solution as backup systems in Windows 10 are planned to be removed in a future release.
<br />Use Macrium Reflect:

<br />Anyhow if you still want to use System Image backup, see the solution here:

            Easeus is another option you can look into. See tutorials about how to properly download Macrium Reflect and set them up.
