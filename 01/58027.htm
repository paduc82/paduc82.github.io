Thank you for the response. I've tried everything you've mentioned above and it still takes about 10 plus minutes to boot up. I've ran a deep root scan and there is no problems. There is to malware (virus), etc. on it. When it finally boots up, it runs absolutely
 great and is really fast. I spoke with Microsoft Help and they told me what to do besides what I already did and they even said there is nothing wrong as everything cleaned up good. Guess I just have to put up with the "slow start-up). Thanks again.

<p>How long is "forever"? Please put a number on it, even if approximate.</p>
<p>My personal view is that the attention many people pay to how long it<br />
takes to boot is unwarranted. Assuming that the computer's speed is<br />
otherwise satisfactory, it is not generally worth worrying about. Most<br />
people start their computers once a day or even less frequently. In<br />
the overall scheme of things, even a few minutes to start up isn't<br />
very important. Personally I power on my computer when I get up in the<br />
morning, then go get my coffee. When I come back, it's done booting. I<br />
don't know how long it took to boot and I don't care.</p>
<p>However if you do want to address it, it may be because of what<br />
programs start automatically, and you may want to stop some of them<br />
from starting that way. On each program you don't want to start<br />
automatically, check its Options to see if it has the choice not to<br />
start (make sure you actually choose the option not to run it, not<br />
just a "don't show icon" option). Many can easily and best be stopped<br />
that way. If that doesn't work, run MSCONFIG from the Start | Run<br />
line, and on the Startup tab, uncheck the programs you don't want to<br />
start automatically.</p>
<p>However, if I were you, I wouldn't do this just for the purpose of<br />
running the minimum number of programs. Despite what many people tell<br />
you, you should be concerned, not with how <strong>many</strong> of these programs<br />
you run, but <strong>which</strong>. Some of them can hurt performance severely, but<br />
others have no effect on performance.</p>

<h2>            DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL &#40;FocusriteUSBwRoot.sys&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since I added a new audio/midi-interface, Focusrite Scarlett 2i4, to my Samsung laptop with Windows 10 I regularly get bluescreens with the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (FocusriteUSBwRoot.sys)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the latest drivers installed, the Focusrite Scarlett works fine as it should in between the crashes. The crashes appear seamingly at random moments, not with specific actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on here and how to solve this? Any help appreciated!</p>

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

<p>Hey I see you notice some of the frame rate issues on some of the backwards compatible games especially reach. This is somewhat expected due to it being a new thing so Microsoft is still trying to work the kinks out as they continue to add more games. As
 the games are being emulated some frame rate issues and lag shall occur. Not sure if this help any!</p>

<p>A "free" feature? Other than Gold, no features cost additional money. So going by that logic I guess we shouldn't expect anything with the console to work properly since all the features are "free".

<p>I never said it's acceptable if it's not working. I'm saying because it's an added free feature that I''ll cut them some slack and see if it improves. Personally I think it will improve .</p>
<p>Some companies charge for BC by the way. So yeah it's a free feature on XB1.</p>

<p>This might be the reason we haven't seen Black Ops come out yet? That is a 60 FPS game, so if BC can't handle Reach at 30 FPS I'm not sure how it will handle any COD game since all of them run at 60 FPS.</p>

Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />
(also Windows 7 and Windows 8)<br />

<strong>BCCode: C2&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000C2 <br />
<br />
</strong>This error is usually a driver issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though<br />
it&nbsp;could be others. Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software
<br />
issues&nbsp;can also cause the error.&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;issues are&nbsp;another possibility after drivers.
<br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs. <br />

This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and<br />
low level chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are getting the X-Trap Error on Windows 10. It can possibly be due to the compatibility issues with the PC and the game components. To better assist you with your concern, please clarify the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you able to play other games on the same PC?</li><li>Have you tried to scan for viruses using an antivirus program on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you <span>
run the <strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong> by following the steps on this
</span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link
</span></a></span><span>to automatically detect and fix some of the most common compatibility issues.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may run the game in compatibility mode to make it work on your Windows 10 PC by following the steps below:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Go to the game folder and right click on the setup file.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>Click on
<strong>Properties</strong> and go to the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>Under the
<strong>Compatibility mode</strong>, check <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for:</strong> and select the operating system where the game is compatible.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>Let the drivers install and launch the game again.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li></ol>

    <title>difference between shutdown button behaviors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msquestionms  say:</h3>
<h2>            difference between shutdown button behaviors</h2>
                    I have two systems, both reporting:<br />
Microsoft Windows XP<br />
Professional<br />
Version 2002<br />
Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
On one, when I press the "Start" button, there are two large buttons available:<br />
"Log Off" is amber and "Turn Off Computer" is red.<br />
<br />
Pressing the button yields a popup called "Turn Off Computer" with three options:<br />
Stand By (amber), Turn Off (red), Restart (green)<br />
<br />
This is the desired behavior.<br />
<br />
On the second computer, the red button visible after pressing "Start" is called "Shut Down".<br />
<br />
That yields a popup called "Shut Down Windows", featuring a drop down list with the following options:<br />
dropdown list<br />
Log off &lt;user&gt;<br />
Shut down<br />
Restart<br />
Stand by<br />
<br />
What do I need to do to make the second computer behave as the first one does?<br />

<h2>            Hibernate button disappears and can&#39;t be reactivated</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar, yet not exactly the same, issue as many others with the hibernate option in Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first installed Windows on my laptop (Samsung series 5 Ultra), the hibernate option was available. Suddenly the hibernate option disappeared from the shutdown menu. When I tried activating it, I received an error message saying that "the system firmware
 did not support hibernation", which of course is not true, since it was there before.
</p>
<p>I know there's a conflict between "hybrid sleep" and hibernate, but that doesn't apply to my situation, as the hybrid sleep option doesn't even appear in my power options.
</p>
<p>The only way I have been able to bring the hibernate option back is by restoring the system to a previous state, but that, of course gets old after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone here has had a similar issue and has successfully restored the hibernate option, could you please share with me the steps you went through to resolve this? Thanks.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand you are not able to get the hibernate option from the shutdown menu.</p>
<p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and the model no of your computer?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any changes prior to this issue?</p>
<p><span>3. When you say "restoring the system to a previous state" are you referring to system restore?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Are you able to see <strong>
hibernate</strong> option when you press <strong>Alt key + F4(function Key)</strong>?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned that you tried enabling the hibernate option but you got the error "the system firmware did not support hibernation".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused if the video card driver does not support the hibernate function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps provided to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall and re-install the video driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <span>Click Start, and then click Control Panel.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click System and Maintenance.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click System, and then click Device Manager.<br />
4.&nbsp;In Device Manager, click to expand "Display adapters”.<br />
5.&nbsp;Right click on the "Display adapters”, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".<br />
6.&nbsp;Similarly look for all items under ""Display adapters” and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
7.&nbsp; Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall "Display adapters” automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Issue persists I suggest you to check drivers updates that you can get on the manufacture’s website and install it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

            <p>Hello, Ravi. Thanks for your quick reply. Before I start, I should say there have been a lot of developments in this situation. Unfortunately, in the end, I still cannot use the hibernate option.<br />
<br />
The answers to your questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Samsung Series 5 Ultra (NP530U4CL)</p>
<p>2. No changes (at least voluntary and conscious) have been made to the computer.</p>
<p>3. I have used the 'Restore your computer to an earlier time' option in the Control Panel</p>
<p>4. No, nothing happens when I use this key combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, about the things I've tried. First, I updated Windows (which hadn't been done in a long time) and this helped on the first round of updates, as I could see and use the hibernate option. To be honest, there were so many updates, that I don't know which
 one did the trick. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, Windows notified me that there were yet more updates, so I installed a second round... and then a third round of updates. Somewhere between the second and third rounds, the hibernate option disappeared and I haven't been able to get it back.
<br />
<br />
Today, I also tried your suggestion of uninstalling the video card driver and allowing Windows to install it afterwards. This did not do the trick and just left me with an awful looking screen, so I decided to re-install the original drivers. I looked in Samsung's
 driver website, and the driver I have installed is the latest available version.<br />
<br />
It is obvious that the hardware does have the capability of hibernating even though Windows thinks otherwise. I am almost certain there is some kind of conflict between Windows and the system, but, of course, the main question is 'what's causing the conflict?'
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings</p>

            <p>Hi Supvato,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>Thanks for providing the detailed information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>You have mentioned you have installed the latest video card driver from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>To have a clarity regarding updates.</p>
<p>Are you able to install all the windows updates?</p>
<p>You may not see hibernate option, if the Hybrid Sleep option is turned on in the laptop or if the user account is corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Hybrid sleep is a type of sleep state that combines sleep and hibernate. When you put the computer into a hybrid sleep state, it writes out all its RAM to the hard drive (just like a hibernate), and then goes into a low power state
 that keeps RAM refreshed (just like a sleep).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps to turn off the Hybrid Sleep option in Laptop.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open the Control Panel from the Start menu.<br />
2.&nbsp;Open Power Options in the Control Panel.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select Change plan settings next to the power plan you want to edit.<br />
4.&nbsp;Select Change advanced power settings.<br />
5.&nbsp;Select Change settings that are currently unavailable in the Power Options window.<br />
6.&nbsp;Click to expand Sleep and select Allow hybrid sleep.<br />
7.&nbsp;In Allow hybrid Sleep turn off the plugged-in option.&nbsp;<br />
8.&nbsp;Click apply and ok.<br />
9.&nbsp;Check if you see the hibernate option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fix a corrupted user profile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
User profiles ensure that your personal preferences are used whenever you log on to Windows. If you tried to log on to Windows and received an error message telling you that your user profile might be corrupted, you can try to repair it. You will need to create
 a new profile, and then copy the files from the existing profile to the new one.<br />
Refer the link below to fix the corrupted user profile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Actually I have 140 of these 1511 machines. On my reference 1511 when I am connected to my home WiFi I&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">can</span> see and set Metered Connections. On the reference machine I have in the field connecting to the MiFi
 Hotspot the option is missing. Updating those machines is not an option as the update complete undoes the settings changes I had to make for my app. There is not enough time to reset all of the settings on 140 machines before Saturday.

            How are you managing the security of these devices? Microsoft ended up support for 1511 earlier this month:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/news/users-still-running-windows-10-version-1511-october-2017-upgrade-deadline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/news/users-still-run...</a>
<br />
<br />You can try a couple things to see if it shows up:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: powershell
<br />Right click PowerShell
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type the following command then hit Enter:
<br />
<br />PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *immersivecontrolpanel*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"
<br />
<br />Restart then check if it restores Metered connection.
<br />
<br />If not, I recommend you download the Windows 10 1511 ISO from <a href="http://windowsiso.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsiso.net</a> if you don't have a copy, then perform a repair upgrade

    <title>Windows 10 password incorrect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> user78049  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 password incorrect</h2>
                    <p>I am absolutely frustrated and hope someone can help me resolve as I believe this isn't impossible. I upgraded from Windows 8 to 10 last week and when I logged in for the first time, my legacy password no longer worked. I visited the live.com link as instructed
 in the error message and reset it online several times to no avail. Finally, (oddly) as my MS login is my Yahoo email address, I finally entered the password associated with my Yahoo account and it worked. I have no idea why. My MS and Yahoo passwords have
 never been the same and still aren't. From there, I was able to use my computer. Yesterday, returned home and logged in again. My password once again was not recognized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have performed the following actions based on KBs and other community peer to peer support, all to no avail. Returning to factory settings is not an option. I have tax documents, and more importantly 1k photos and videos of our babies which I cannot afford
 to lose. Please help me. I am in tears over this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Machine</strong></p>
<p>Toshiba Satelitte laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have performed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset my password via the live.com link in the error message over 60 times in 4 hours</li><li>Logged in using the on-screen keyboard&nbsp;</li><li>Confirmed language is EN</li><li>Turned off Internet access and logged in using the last password that worked</li><li>Unplugged my computer, removed the battery and held down the power button for 30+ seconds</li><li>Logged in using another account (non-admin) and was able to log in successfully (this account has no access to our family files)</li><li>Tried all possible passwords, variations, etc. that I have ever had online&nbsp;</li></ul>

            <p>Adding to this case. I spoke to Sheila with Microsoft Support at 9:08am CT. After walking her through the bullets above, she replied by asking me to perform the exact same actions I had already relayed to her. I understand MS is reading through documents
 to troubleshoot, but there's a gap here. They are not trained to think. To perform troubleshooting tasks unless clearly drafted in front of them. They are not listening to the customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Her final recommendation (and only recommendation as she indicated) was to purchase Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft, you're telling me that after being locked out of my computer, I need to pay you for this deficient product or restore my computer to factory settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will never upgrade again. I should have known better to upgrade to a product in its first 6 months of shipment. Please point me to the nearest Apple store.&nbsp;</p>

            Same thing happened to me<br />
<br />
Managed to get pass it by creating a new account via command prompt<br />
<br />
Here are the steps I followed<br />
<br />
First: you have to enter to command prompt, for me it was easy cause my vaio has recovery option to allow me use command prompt while being outside windows. If you don't have this option then better to Boot off the Windows disk and select the “Repair your computer”
 then choose command prompt from the options.<br />
<br />
Second: you’ll want to type in the following command to backup the original sticky keys file:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe c:\<br />
<br />
Then you’ll copy the command prompt executable (cmd.exe) over top of the sticky keys executable:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe<br />
<br />
Then write yes<br />
<br />
Now you can reboot the PC.<br />
<br />
Once you get to the login screen, hit the Shift key 5 times, and you’ll see an administrator mode command prompt.<br />
<br />
Third: you will need to create a new user account through command prompt<br />
<br />
Write the following:<br />
1.net user /add useraccountname mypassword<br />
2.net localgroup administrators useraccountname /add<br />
3.net share concfg=C:/grant:useraccountname,full ((number 3 may not work, no problem ignore)<br />
<br />
Finally you will find now new user created, you can log in with the password you chosen
<br />
<br />
You will have all your installed programs but you windows settings will return to the default.

            <p>Hi Robert and Lorraine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue as well but by luck I managed to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem was that the Fn (Function) key was set to locked on after the update! &nbsp;Because I couldn't see the password I was typing in ( all * ) I didn't know I was entering it wrong over and over. If your laptop/device has a FN key, try retyping your password
 while pressing the FN key for the characters in your password that have an alternate. Hope you find your answer</p>

            <p><span>Hi Lorraine,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on this query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We really appreciate the troubleshooting steps you performed in order to resolve your issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does the issue occur with other user profile as well?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the method below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><strong>Boot
 the computer in Safe Mode</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To go to safe mode follow the steps below</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Restart
</span></span></strong><span><span>your</span><strong><span>PC.
<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Press&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Shift + F8</span></strong><span>&nbsp;before the Windows logo appears.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>See Advanced Repair Options</span></strong><span>.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Step 4:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong><span>.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Step 5:</span></strong><span> Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong><span>.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Step 6:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings</span></strong><span>.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Step 7:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></span><span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You then see a list where you can choose&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(depending
 on whether you think you’ll need the Internet).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:
</strong>If the issue is not resolved, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">create another <strong>
Administrator user profile</strong> and check if the issue persist.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Following is the link about
<strong>Create a user account</strong>:</span></span></p>

                    <p>My internet comes from a Mobile Broadband service and I wish to turn OFF the metered connection settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This setting causes certain programs including Microsoft Outlook 2016 to work offline. Very frustrating when trying to run a business.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have a large data allowance and this is the only form of internet
 available.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>
</p><p>How do I change the settings for a metered network for mobile broadband? I wish to remove the metered network setting for my mobile connection.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft please provide a fix for this problem immediately. A large amount of people now use mobile connections for internet and we should be allowed to choose this option instead of it being a default.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I understand that you are unable reinstall Sketup app after upgrading to Windows 10. We’ll certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try uninstalling the program via Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Registry disclaimer</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However,
<strong>serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. </strong>
Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the
 following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: </span>
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/en-us</span></span></a></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open <strong>Rrun command.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Type regedit and hit Enter to open <strong>Registry Editor.</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Navigate to the following location.<br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall </strong>
<br />
4.&nbsp;You will see all the programs installed with long names or numbers<br />
5.&nbsp;If you see names, then it would be easy to identify and in most cases its <strong>
UninstallString </strong>would point to its un-installers path.<br />
6.&nbsp;If you see long numbers, click on each of them till you are able to find Sketchup program.<br />
7.&nbsp;Now, in the right pane, search for a string value called <strong>UninstallString</strong>.<br />
8.&nbsp;Double-click on it. From the dialog box which opens, <strong>copy its value.</strong><br />
9.&nbsp;Open command prompt (Windows + R), <strong>paste the value </strong>and hit <strong>
Enter</strong>.</p>
<span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>Hope this will help you. If the issue persist, I would suggest that you&nbsp;contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://help.sketchup.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sketchup support team

<h3> geraldmichels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the drive Windows 10 boots from</h2>
                    I have an HP Envy Laptop. &nbsp;It comes with one, 1TB hard drive. &nbsp;I replaced the optical drive with an Sony SSD drive and cloned it from the C drive. &nbsp;My goal is to boot from the SSD drive for faster performance. &nbsp;Once everything is working, I will use the
 original C drive for storage. I want the computer to boot from the SSD rather than the regular C drive. Has anyone done this, and could you give me some tips? &nbsp;I went to the bios manager, but could not find a way to change boot drive. The bios is Insyde F
 3.0. &nbsp;Thanks!

<h3> schnurpfeil  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Unplug&#34; feature in the task bar</h2>
                    Recently I have noticed that the "unplug" feature that I use to disconnect my&nbsp;Ipod and flash cards before taking them out of the computer is giving me an option to "unplug" my hard drive and CD drive.&nbsp; This concerns me as I have other family memebers who
 use the computer and that they may accidently harm the system.&nbsp; Could you tell me if I may have a problem here or how to stop it from asking me to turn off the hard / Dvd drives?&nbsp; I still need the function to work for my periferals.&nbsp; Thank you for your help.

            Hi Schnurpfeil,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;Do you remember any recent changes made prior to this issue?<br />
•&nbsp;Does it come up all the time you use the “Safely Remove hardware” Option?<br />
<br />
A) Try updating the CD/Drive with the latest firmware available from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
<br />
B) You may also try updating the BIOS (Basic Input/output System).<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />

            To answer your questions.<br />
No, I do not remember making any recent changes.&nbsp; I let Vista check for and apply&nbsp;updates from Microsoft by itself.&nbsp; Do you think a recent update to vista did this?&nbsp; Yes it does come up every time recently.&nbsp; I would say&nbsp; it started about 3 weeks ago but that
 is only from my fuzzy memory.<br />
<br />
The drives are the same ones that&nbsp;came installed&nbsp;since I bought the unit from Dell.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where would I find&nbsp;out&nbsp;what company made the&nbsp;drives?&nbsp; Is it possiable to&nbsp;download "Firmware" from a website or just "software"?&nbsp; I really dont know the&nbsp;differance but thought
 I'd&nbsp;ask.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no idea how to do anything in the Bios.&nbsp; I seriously doupt I would be able to adjust anything with out some hand holding.<br />
<br />
My freind suggested that it may be a virus or something.&nbsp; Would that effect a Microsoft program like this?

<h3> helpme5400  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving pictures around within a folder.</h2>
                    Ok, so we all know that in Windows 8 we lost the ability to move pictures around within a folder, I was sure hoping they fixed this issue in windows 10, and maybe they have, but I still can seem to move my pictures around within a folder... It is very
 important for me to have the option to move photo's or anything around within a folder... for instants I have 100 photos and videos in a folder, I want to move them around to the order I need, then I select all and rename them so they will stay in the order
 I rearranged them to. &nbsp;I still use my old laptop that has windows 7 so I can do this, after all the talk about this with windows 8 I thought for sure they have fixed this issue in 10... &nbsp;PLEASE TELL ME I'M WRONG AND WE CAN DO THIS IN WINDOWS 10....

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on the brighter side, you can use the Photo App native in Windows 10 to organize your pictures.</p>
<p>The Photo app will combine both on-device photos as well as those located on a user's OneDrive account, and eliminates any duplicate photos.</p>
<p>The Photo app will sync up from a phone, to the OneDrive, and down to a PC. It can also creates automatic photo albums based on time, location, but users can create albums manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>However, If you have any suggestions about Windows 10, I suggest you to post your valuable feedback about Windows 10 in feedback app. So, that it will be helpful for the developers to integrate the changes suggested by you.
</span></span></p>

<h2>            Xbox one continually saying &#34;just getting your game&#47;app ready&#34;</h2>
                    <p>my xbox one just continues to say it's getting my game or app ready and even if i try to hit cancel the message pops up again. I've tried the hard reset by holding down the power button and leaving it off for several minutes and unplugged it as well but no changes when turned back on.</p>

<h2>            Enforcement query.....</h2>
                    <p>Was playing in a chat party, on a game I&nbsp;received for xmas, with my son and friends. I&nbsp;got an abusive message, which i reported. I&nbsp;found the player and asked him about his outfit - as I&nbsp;had not seen that before, maybe he had baited me, but I&nbsp;wasnt abusive etc - he lost his game and i laughed as he was messaging all the guys playing giving them grief.<br />I&nbsp;then received a 24 hour ban - with no explanation, just a link to the generalized material. Not specific etc.<br />It isnt eligible for review, as its 24 hour, but Im a little annoyed.<br /><br />I&nbsp;have good reputation, I&nbsp;always send good game messages to people and I&nbsp;have never received a ban in the last 9 years or near enough, of being on xbox live.<br /><br />Why cant this be reviewed?&nbsp;why cant I&nbsp;talk to someone on the enforcement team about this ?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>24 hour suspensions can't be review as by the time the investigation is finished the suspension would be over anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;Any reports filed against you have to be investigated which takes time so you were most likely suspended for something you did several weeks ago,not something that happened in the past few days.</p><p>&nbsp;Your rep has nothing to do with getting suspended,you can have good rep &amp; still be suspended or banned.</p><p>&nbsp;You will not get the specific details as to what you did.</p>
