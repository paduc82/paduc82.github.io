    <title>Randomly Missing Protocols for Ethernet Internet Connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Randomly Missing Protocols for Ethernet Internet Connection</h2>
                    <p>I just returned from a holiday and my desktop computer (running W10) no longer connects to the internet via the ethernet cable. There is no problem with the wifi connection however.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer still recognises the ethernet cable (network display changes to/from "no ethernet cable plugged in") and that there is some kind of network/connection available, and seems to be able to register that data transfer is possible (it has an increasing
 duration for the connection time, registers a max speed available and the media state is "enabled"). However, it cannot "identify" the network resulting in no internet access.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Network and Sharing Centre it states: that it is a "Local Area Connection" with "No Network Access"; that it is an "Unidentified Network"; and a "Public Network".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repeatedly tried to Troubleshoot Problems which has stated that my computer is apparently Missing Network Protocols, and the attempts to repair as system admin has been unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the failure of the troubleshooting I have:</p>
<p>- reset my computer</p>
<p>- undertaken a system restore for my computer</p>
<p>- reset my router</p>
<p>- uninstalled and reinstalled/updated the network adapter drivers (Realtec PCIe GBE Family Controller)</p>
<p>- tried various ethernet cables (which I have confirmed to work in different machines) in multiple ports of the router</p>
<p>- ensured that IPv4 &amp; 6 are automatically searching for the IP address </p>
<p>- Vainly attempted to input a static IP address for IPv4 just in case, although I think that this property's internet does not have a static IP for each bit of equipment and I'm not convinced that would be the solution even if I could secure a static IP.
</p>
<p>- Checked that DHCP is enabled</p>
<p>- Searched the web for information of value (which either reaffirmed my previous steps or gave little of immediate value, like waiting and hoping it resolves itself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have now exhausted all of the options I can think of would really appreciate any help that any one can offer (bearing in mind that I'm not great at network related jargon!). If anyone would like more information please just ask.</p>
<p>

            <p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for bringing up your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Appreciate the steps that you have taken so far to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sometimes firewall software might prevent you from getting connected. You can see if the connection issue is caused by a firewall by turning it off temporarily, and then trying to visit a website you trust.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The steps to turn off a firewall depend on the firewall software you‚Äôre using. Check the documentation for your firewall software to learn how to turn it off.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Make sure you turn it back on as soon as you can. Not having a firewall turned on makes your PC more vulnerable to hackers, worms, or viruses.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you have trouble turning off your firewall, do the following to turn off all firewall software that's running on your PC. Again, make sure you turn your firewall back on as soon as you can.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>* In the search box on the taskbar, type Command prompt, right-click (or press and hold) Command prompt, and then select Run as administrator &gt; Yes.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>* At the command prompt, type netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off, and then press Enter.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>* Open your web browser and visit a website you trust and see if you can connect to it.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>* To turn on all firewalls you might have installed, at the command prompt, type netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on, and then press Enter.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you find the firewall software is causing the connection issues, contact the software manufacturer or visit their website to check and see if updated software is available.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Effectively, do you/Windows now regard programmes as Apps or is there a specific difference, and can expect to not waste an entire day reinstalling every bit of software on my machine?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same problem, it was all working fine on Jan 1st, then suddenly i have exactly the same error. &nbsp;I have not installed anything since (some updates may have updated automatically) so i do not know why anything has changed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also searched the net and done all the things listed above. &nbsp;A keep my files re-install seems quite extreme - is this really going to fix the issue??? &nbsp;I would rather not then have to spend hours reinstalling all the 3rd party drivers which were all
 working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help,</p>

            <p>The reset did nothing, please can you offer further advice (outside of a major Windows reinstall/repair).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the fact that some one else has commented indicating exactly the same issue, it is very unlikely to be a local corruption of windows and/or the network protocols.

            <p>lets see, i have this exact same issue, and troubleshooter doesnt work because it cant connect to the internet, firewalls arent the issue, as its a NETWORK PROTOCOL not the firewall itself, doing a refresh/reset doesnt fix it and actually is more annoying
 then the issue itself because the issue is still there and we have to reinstall what stuff that did get removed by the reset, and while restarting makes the issue go away, it doesnt fix it because it just comes back later, give us a patch for windows that
 fixes this issue, not some ****support that sounds like it has been copy and pasted from a guide book</p>

            Hi MyamBug 
<br />
<br />Log into your daughters account, seeing as she is now the Administrator
<br />
<br />Click the Start Button, then just type netplwiz and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, select the account you want to make administrator and click Properties
<br />
<br />On the Group Membership tab, set that account as Administrator
<br />
<br />Please Note, Always set another account as administrator before changing an existing account to non-admin, you never want to end up in a situation where there is no administrator on a PC, because that will stop you making any meaningful changes to your PC and most likely result in a clean install being required ...

<p>You're fundamentally misunderstanding something about user accounts. But not to worry.&nbsp; üòâ</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user account is not associated or connected to <em>anyone</em> in a technical way. From a technical point of view, anyone who has the password to a user account can sign in and use the account. Although the account may belong to your daughter from a&nbsp;<em>moral</em>
 point of view, Windows doesn't know or care about that. It's just a user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you no longer want your daughter to use the Administrators account, simply change the password so that she can no longer sign in to that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further advise you, I'd like to know what you mean by "<span>... change it to another account." What exactly do you want to accomplish? Once I know, it will be easy to advise you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In general:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A Windows PC needs only&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span> Administrators account which, in practice, you will hardly ever sign into. Every other account should be a Users account (formerly known
 as a Limited or Standard account.) This is the way that Windows PCs were designed to be used. I can elaborate if you wish.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 not showing Apps in the Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzannemuenz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not showing Apps in the Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 recently updated on my computer and now the apps that used to show up on the start menu are not there. When I try to access my photos, movies, or even the calculator, I get an error message "Windows cannot access the specific device, path, or
 file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item." As far as I know, we did not make any changes to the computer and have not changed any file locations, just had a recent Windows update, and since then it has not worked. I went online
 and tried a few of the solutions that were suggested. Many of them were several years old (most from 2015) and did not work. The only thing we were able to do was have my husband log on using his Microsoft ID from our Xbox. When he went to the start menu under
 his ID, all of the apps appeared, but none of the documents, photos, etc., were there. This is very frustrating because it is the same computer and does not make sense. Also, if it ends up happening to him, we will not be able to access our apps on the computer
 at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Virtual Technician and that also was a bust. They suggested I go to the community, even though I have already done that. Someone else must have had this issue and found a solution more recently than 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help please?&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello SusanneMuenz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you keep <strong>restore points</strong> in Windows Recovery? &nbsp;If you haven't previously activated "Protection On", in System Properties, then this option is not available for you. &nbsp;You must have it turned on previously or else restore points are not
 kept by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to turn it on for next time</span>: &nbsp;Control Panel &gt;Security and Maintenance &gt;Recovery &gt;Configure System Restore &gt;Configure &gt;Turn on system protection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After activating "system protection", restore points will be periodically created. &nbsp;You will then be able to restore to an earlier point in time, if you so desire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is helpful to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

    <title>Black Ops 1 DLC Not Showing Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jammasterjacob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Ops 1 DLC Not Showing Up</h2>
                    
<p>When I first attempted to play Black Ops 1 on the Xbox One right after it had become backwards compatible, I realized the only DLC map pack that showed that I owned it was the first, despite me having purchased,
 owned, and played them all on the Xbox 360. I settled and downloaded the first DLC and had fun playing. Finally, however many days later, I have decided to figure out why the other three DLC map packs aren't showing up. I tried every "solution" I have found
 on the internet to no avail. I have tried going into "My games and apps" on the One and looking for any uninstalled DLC's, but again the only one that showed up was the first DLC pack. I have confirmed that the account that I purchased the DLC's on is indeed
 the account that I am logged into and attempting to find the missing map packs on. I am at a loss, and have even consulted an Xbox Ambassador who could not help me.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

    <title>Second Life causing black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winkinclowns72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second Life causing  black screen</h2>
                    This game used to work fine, but over the past couple of months, I've had countless black-screen occurances, every time I play, within the first 30 minutes of gameplay.&nbsp; The cursor becomes erratic and within 30 seconds, the screen goes black, with just
 a white arrow on it, which doesn't move.&nbsp; The pc makes a strange (underwater-like) noise, and if I don't switch it off quickly, the next result is a blue-screen.<br />
<br />
I've updated the BIOS from HP and graphics from Nvidia.&nbsp; I've also installed Spybot S+D and Malwarebytes; both have removed Adware and Malware from my pc (12 Adware from iWin Games).&nbsp; All this, despite running Microsoft Security Essentials (full-scan running
 every day and up-to-date).&nbsp; I've also run countless Fix It Solution Centre trials, but nothing remotely similar to this problem.<br />
<br />
Please help; trying to play this game is no longer fun, which it used to be.&nbsp; I seem to spend more and more time trying to solve problems than having fun using my pc, which it used to be.&nbsp; I've uninstalled the game and reinstalled it a couple of times, in the
 hope it might remove problems, but it didn't.&nbsp; I've also visited the Second Life site, and Forums, but no solutions/updates offered.<br />
<br />
Thank you to all the Support Team, for their time and efforts.<br />
<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There are 3rd party drivers available for the same. You need to search using your preferred search engine to get it.<br />
The other option is to install the drivers in compatibility mode.</p>

    <title>remove game data from xbox game in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            remove game data from xbox game in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded a game, Alto's Adventure. I did some of the game and then someone else took the game and did much more with it and got further. I wanted to do those things myself. I now want to restart the game from fresh, but I don't see any way of doing that.
 If I uninstall the game and reinstall it, the progress is still there. If I press and hold the game icon and go to game settings, I see an option to reset the game, but after I use that option, and open the game, the progress is still right where I left it.
 I go into the xbox app on my windows tablet but there's no option to remove game progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to get a fresh experience of this game, start anew, but I see now way of doing that. How do I do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is labelled as an xbox game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you help.</p>

<p>Hi Henry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are signed in to your Xbox account when playing the game, your game saves will be stored to the cloud storage. If you're playing the game without signing in your Xbox account, you can reset the game from Settings to remove your game saves. Let's try
 to isolate this issue so that we could find a way for you to remove your game data. Kindly perform the following steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Reset the game from Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows key, then select the gear icon to access <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>, locate the game.</li><li>Click the game, then select <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove Temporary files on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, and then click the Settings icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>System</strong>, and then select <strong>
Storage</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>This PC</strong> and click on <strong>
Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>Remove files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</em><br />

<p>I followed your instructions exactly. After all that, the game would not load from fresh. It was exactly in the same state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game does seem to automatically sync with something, maybe the xbox player account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there's no change yet.</p>

<p>I appreciate your reply.&nbsp; It seems that the game progress was saved to your Xbox account associated on your computer that's why you can't play the game from the beginning. I recommend that you remove the account on your computer by performing the following
 steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows icon, then select the gear icon to access Settings.</li><li>Select Accounts.</li><li>Under Email &amp; app accounts, click the Microsoft account, then click Remove.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest that you reset the Xbox app on your computer so that we could ensure that no account is linked to it. To get started, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows key, then select the gear icon to access&nbsp;<span>Settings</span>.</li><li>Go to&nbsp;<span>Apps</span>.</li><li>Under&nbsp;<span>Apps &amp; features</span>, locate the Xbox app.</li><li>Click the Xbox app, then select&nbsp;<span>Advanced options</span>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<span>Reset</span>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that works for you. We'd be glad to further assist you.<br />

<p>I can't complete your instructions. In your first set of instructions, you say, in point 3, to select "remove" when I select the Microsoft account. But when I select the Microsoft account, the only option is "Manage," and when I select it, it opens Edge
 browser and shows me my microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I follow your advice to remove my account, what are the ramifications for my windows tablet. Would I have to remove the account permanently? If I were to reassociate my account with my tablet, would the saved games come back on the game?</p>

            Thank you for the reply. It seems that the account is the one you used to set up your tablet that's why there's no option to remove it. Removing the account will help us to confirm if the saved games are associated with it. When you reset and launch the
 game, can you tell us if it shows a window wherein it's telling you that it's syncing your account? If so, have you tried to cancel it?

<p>When I just open the game without resetting it, a xbox window came up about syncing but disappeared quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reset the game and started it again, the same window came up and still quickly disappears and the game is not reset, as it continues from the last place I was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reset the game, started it again, and quickly managed to click the cancel option on that same xbox window, it gave me a choice to continue sync or stop it, stating that if I stop it, the game will start with incomplete data. If I select to stop the
 sync, the game still continues from where I stopped the last time and it does not allow me to start afresh.</p>

<p>Thank you for that information. Can you tell us if you're signed in to your account on the Xbox app on your device? If so, can you try to sign it out and reset the Xbox app as well before trying to launch the game? In this way, we can be able to stop the
 sync process since it will not detect any Xbox account signed in on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your update.</p>

            <p>You probably need to install audio drivers for your PC. Audio drivers are probably not the only drivers you are missing. Install mainboard chipset drivers before any other device drivers. Go to the Dell support website and enter your service tag to get a
 list of drivers</p>

<p>then download and install them.</p>

            Thanks, this was helpful in that I was able to determine that My Passport model is NOT compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; So now I'm not sure how to adequately do a backup of my laptop before installing Windows 10.&nbsp; I don't want to just back up my documents
 and photos, but also my favorites, desktop icons, and some programs that I don't have actual CDs for.&nbsp; Any recommendations?

    <title>Remove non-existant network shares - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arrrrrrrrggggggghhhhh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove non-existant network shares</h2>
                    I recently bought a large new hard drive.&nbsp; I had several directories shared on the old hard drive (Drive J), but those resources are now on the new hard drive (Drive L.&nbsp; Now I can't make my laptop believe that those old shared directories are not there
 anymore, and the list of shares on my laptop still shows them.&nbsp; (Of course, when I try to access those "ghost" directories, the laptop can't find them.)&nbsp; When I share the same directories on the old drive, the shares show up on the laptop as "New Downloads2,
 Military2, etc.<br />
<br />
I need to know how to remove those old "ghost" shares from the list on the laptop.&nbsp; I can't figure out how to do this -- I can't unshare the old directories because they aren't there anymore.&nbsp; The laptop accepts the new shares I gave it, but won't let go of
 the old, "ghost" shares either.&nbsp; I can find a menu, whether in windows or by right click, that allows me to delete the ghost share.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what to do?<br />

            <p>Ya I know what your talking about, I'm having the same problem, what I think its because Microsoft wants you to either use the cloud or buy your own server software is why the network is acting so weird, and why there is so many bugs with it in the first
 place that's my opinion though, its ridiculous that Microsoft is only geared for established business, they think everyone has $2000.00 dollars lying about just to give them for the software which is both snobbish and greedy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only what I've ever found to fix this but was do a clean install of the main harddrive, and wipe out any old settings in the system just get a repair disk setup or a system install disk and do a fresh reinstall of the entire operating system is the best
 way to get rid of bugs and errors like the ones your having.</p>

<h2>            Halo Wars 2 Crashes into BSoD during any type of Campaign Loading or Multiplayer after Dec 17</h2>
                    <p>From what seems to be caused by either the update this game recently had or because of the windows 10 OS update on Dec 17 this game Halo Wars 2 no longer is playable and I have reinstalled the game and it does the same thing.&nbsp; I was playing it fine about
 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; When you go to load into the game and start a saved game or continue campaign or multiplayer the games goes to black screen and after 20 secs the sounds skips and stops then my pc locks and I get the BSoD or blue screen of death and I get a error
 stop code spooling etc stop error.&nbsp; I haven't changed anything on my pc and everythings updated to the latest. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know what to do to keep trying stuff except another uninstall and reinstall or fresh start or reset in which I would be forced to redownload again anyways cause you cant backup or save the game and installer.&nbsp; Anyone else have a problem when this
 game loads into a save or whatever??&nbsp; Seems to be either the game update or windows 10 update recently.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. Updating your graphics card drivers manually can help resolve the issue and prevent the PC from crashing. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;button, type<strong>&nbsp;Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards, expand the&nbsp;<strong>Display
 adapters</strong>&nbsp;category, right-click your graphics card and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver:
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></li><li><span>Right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>

            <p>I also have encountered this exact issue.</p>
<p>This error popped up after Windows 10 was just installed and before its first reboot to the normal workstation status.</p>
<p>Besides the screenshot above which reproduced this issue, when I right click the item in the Favorites bar in Internet Explorer, the same error will crash IE as well.</p>
<p>I tried to use RegEdit.exe to find out which entry was causing this issue. I found that when the RegEdit.exe would freeze when I used the search function and the search point ran to some part of the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I met with this issue from build 10240, which was upgraded from Windows 7, and after upgrading to build 10586.*, this issue was continuously haunting my Windows still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many programs were affected by this issue and they all crashed with the same popup except FileLocator.</p>
<p>1, My Computer right click and select Management -&gt; crash</p>
<p>2, Right click items in the IE Favorite Bar -&gt; crash</p>
<p>3, Right click the popup menu in Listary -&gt; crash</p>
<p>4, Right click the dictionary panel in BowPad -&gt; crash</p>
<p>5, Right click the search result item in FileLocator Lite -&gt; exceptions were caught by the program and it managed to survive, but not working properly</p>
<p>6, Right click the folder panel in HaoZip -&gt; crash</p>

            <p>SOLVED!</p>
<p>On another forum, participant mlivshin reports one of the few actual solutions I have seen posted for this error (which I also receive). He/she reports this in the third page of thread&nbsp;https://8pecxstudios.com/Forums/viewtopic.php?t=1364 as related to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(46, 139, 87, 1)"><strong>Faulting
 module path: C:\Windows\System32\ShellExtBridge\ShellExtBridge117.dll</strong>,</span>&nbsp;which was subsequently renamed as a fix. This dll was a remnant from an incompletely uninstalled Moo0 application. Moo0 does not claim Win10 compatibility. (I am using a
 free Moo0 context menu adjuster, without substantial problem other than receiving this message at times.) The method eventually suggested in the cited thread should lead to isolation of the cause if the problem is an incompatibility but not this particular
 file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This solved the problem also on my PC, only difference: the file I renamed was ShellExtBridge118.dll</p>
<p>I also had MooRightClicker installed and an uninstall left over this file.</p>
<p>I had this Error Message always when I tried to install Opera Browser. Now it works!</p>

    <title>extremely SLOW browsing&#47;download speeds on SurfaceBook since last - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            extremely SLOW browsing&#47;download speeds on SurfaceBook since last update</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing extremely slow browsing/download speeds since the last overall update. The speeds start out a bit slow&nbsp; and then continue to creep downward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally thought it could be my ISP though I tried speedtest with another machine and the speeds were correct. The issue does seem to be isolated to the SB. I am using the SB dock so this is not a WiFi issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi JT,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would need to look into some settings and perform a couple of troubleshooting to get your Surface back to great browsing speed. What update was installed on your Surface? You can check this by going to
<strong>Settings </strong>(Windows key + I) &gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security </strong>
&gt; <strong>View update history</strong>. Since you mentioned that you are experiencing the slow network speed while the Surface is docked, I assume that there are no issues when you undock the Surface and connect to the WiFi. Is that right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's check what services or programs are running and consuming data when the Surface is connected to the Surface Dock. Open
<strong>Task Manager</strong> (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and click on the <strong>Network
</strong>column to sort the programs according to usage. Take note of which app could be consuming data the most. Also, go to the
<strong>Startup </strong>tab and see if a program you are not using runs in the background and could be consuming data. To switch off startup items, click on it and select
<strong>Disable </strong>at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, <strong><a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong> (28 MB). Afterwards, perform a forced shutdown by pressing the power button for about 10 seconds or until the
 screen goes off. Restart the Surface normally for the software to be reloaded properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest that you use the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023478/surface-update-your-surface-dock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Dock Update Tool</a></strong> to ensure the Surface Dock is running the best
 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following the suggestions, see if the browsing or download speed will be better. Otherwise, let me know so we can perform additional troubleshooting. I'll be notified when you reply and I'll get back to you the soonest I can to provide more help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Good morning and than you for your response! Unfortunately the steps you described to eliminate the slow-surfing speed problem did not work. Below are the steps I have taken and a couple of additional notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All testing efforts are with the computer connected to the Surface Dock using SpeedTest.net unless stated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a clean install of the Win10 and all software. - this did <strong>
NOT </strong>resolve the problem</p>
<p>I performed a clean boot as you requested and this did <strong>NOT </strong>resolve the problem</p>
<p>I rebooted the machine using a USB3 network adapter and the speeds <strong>were exactly as I would expect</strong>.</p>
<p>I connected the dock and ran a speed test immediately that had speeds <strong>
as I would expect</strong>.</p>
<p>I ran a speed test two-minutes later and the speeds w<strong>ere back to the SLOW speeds</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a Mac connected to the same port as the Surface dock, I obtained <strong>
speeds as I would expect</strong>.</p>
<p>I performed another clean install of just Win10. Immediately after the machine finished installation, speeds were
<strong>as I would expect</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two minutes later I performed another speedtest and the spends were <strong>back at the slow speeds</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the two minute interval, the machines fans were spinning so I am assuming that there was some type of behind the scenes install or update taking place though I can not diagnose or scientifically confirm that. It was merely a professional observation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this issue seemed to surface (no pun intended) just after the last major update. Since I've done numerous clean installs, I do not have any way to roll-back the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional suggestion you might have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>JT</p>

<p>Thank you for updating this thread. Just out of curiosity, can you tell us what is the speed being shown in your speedtest? What is the subscribed speed from your provider? If you're getting a lot of fan noise and believe that there's a background application
 running, let's try to determine that by running a battery test. To do this, kindly click on Cortana, and type the word command. The command prompt will appear in your menu. Right click on it and left click on on Run as Administrator. You'll see a black box.
 In that black box, type: powercfg /batteryreport /output "C:\battery_report.html".<br />
<br />
We will be waiting for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
