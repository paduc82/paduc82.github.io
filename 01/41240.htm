                    I am trying to free some space on a 70G hard drive. Windows is using 66.1G of space with 30000+ files &amp; 2500+ folders. Any help on Exactly What I can get rid of would be great.&nbsp; Program files are only using .98GB of space, there are no pics or docs on

<p><span>You may wish to free up some disk space (will also aid in getting rid of things you do not utilize) by going through these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Windows XP should take between 4.5 and 15GB *with* an Office suite, Photo Editing software, alternative Internet browser(s), various Internet plugins and a host of other things installed.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If you are comfortable with the stability of your system, you can delete the uninstall files for the patches that Windows XP has installed...<br />
<a href="http://www3.telus.net/dandemar/spack.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www3.telus.net/dandemar/spack.htm</a><br />

<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can run Disk Cleanup - built into Windows XP - to erase all but your latest restore point and cleanup even more "loose files"..</span></p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</span></p>
<p><span>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the
 hibernate feature and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</span></p>
<p><span>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</span></p>
<p><span>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</span></p>
<p><span>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
( just the disk cleanup - don't play with the registry part for now )</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Other ways to free up space..</span></p>
<p><span>SequoiaView<br />
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/</a></span></p>

<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/</a></span></p>
<p><span>Those can help you visually discover where all the space is being used. Then you can determine what to do.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>After that - you will want to check for any physical errors and arrange everything for efficient access...</span></p>

 you do not need and then configure them (via their own built-in mechanisms is the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources without reason.</span></p>
<p><span>You can download and utilize&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Process Explorer</a>&nbsp;to see exactly what is taking up your processor/CPU time and

            Follow the directions from Shenan Stanley.<br />
<br />
If, <b>when you're done</b>, you find that C:\Windows\Installer is very large, post back for directions on dealing with that issue.<br />
<br />
With respect to "KB" files --<br />
<br />
There are two types of files associated with patches installed by Windows Update.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The ones that take up the most space are the $NTUninstallKBxxxxxxx$ <b>folders</b> (usually shown in blue type because they are compressed).&nbsp; These folders are needed only if you decide to uninstall some update.&nbsp; Generally, after your system has run a while
 with any given update, there's no good reason to uninstall it.&nbsp; To delete these folders, see either Shenan's links or this alternative:
<a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Hotfix_backup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Hotfix_backup.htm</a><br />
<br />
The other files are log files, created during the installation of each patch.&nbsp; Because these are small text files, you won't gain a lot of space by deleting them.&nbsp; Maybe a few MB total.&nbsp; AFAIK, there is no good reason to keep these files -- unless you are attempting
 to debug a problem with the installation of a particular update (and that's probably not something that most users do on their own).<br />
<br />
If in doubt, zip them up and burn to a CD or DVD.&nbsp; That way, if the need to look at one of these logs ever arises (highly unlikely), you can retrieve it.<br />

<h2>            Minecraft&#58; Windows 10 Edition&#58; I can&#39;t join my friend&#39;s game</h2>
                    <p>My friend and I are trying yet failing to play Minecraft together, but we're on different platforms. (I'm on my computer on windows 10 edition, while she is on her Xbox one.) We have tried multiple methods, including invites, directly joining through the
 Xbox app, and joining through Minecraft itself, and none of it is working. Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>just to be sure, are any of you participating in a beta version of Minecraft?</p>
<p>If that is the case then you won't be able to play together, since it's a requirement for both players be on the same exact version of the game.</p>
<p>So please double check that both versions are identical, this can also be the case if one of you has updated the game while the other one hasn't yet.</p>
<p>Another requirement is that all accounts need to be signed in via Xbox Live, that option is available on all platforms, this will only require Gold subscription on the Xbox One console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also be sure to check it Allow user created content is enabled at <a href="http://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.xbox.com/settings</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if these requirements are met and if it still isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>As WPAK said you need to be on the same version to play together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also is your friend playing on the xbox one edition or the bedrock version?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will also be a factor to not be able to join each other. As only the bedrock edition is crossplay between Windows 10, xbox one, PE and now Nintendo Switch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While others already mentioned the different version, just make sure that your friend is NOT playing on the "Xbox One Edition" Minecraft. If the title shows "Xbox One Edition" under the Minecraft logo, you can't play together. She has to be playing on the
 "Minecraft" without the "Xbox One Edition" in the title, the so-called "Bedrock" engine or "Better together update" Version. If she has Minecraft Xbox One Edition bought digitally, she can simply download the "Minecraft" for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If she has the Xbox One Edition on disc, she might have missed the deadline of having played at least 5 hours before January 31st 2018, and might not be eligible anymore to get the upgraded Minecraft for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, if your friend is still under 18 years old, be aware that her parents have to set up her account to be able to play online with other people. If necessary, their parents have to go to
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> and add her child account to their parent account, if not already done so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parents (or she as an adult with her own adult account) then go to <a href="https://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.xbox.com/settings</a> and set the online and privacy settings accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Minecraft to work, she needs to be able to see creations from other players in the online and privacy settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And online multiplayer has to be allowed for Xbox One and Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows Update error 80244FFF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freitasm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update error 80244FFF</h2>
                    Since last week my laptop running Windows 8.1 (upgraded from Windows 8) has been showing an error 0x80244FFF when running Windows Update.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried the usual recommendations (including sfc /scannow, chkdsk, disk cleanup, clean boot, etc, Windows Defender off, Firewall off). Also tried using a different network/ISP and got the same error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other devices in my LAN are running Windows Update successfully, including a HP Microserver (Windows Server 2012 R2), Surface 2 (Windows 8.1) and a HTPC (Windows 7 SP1).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas would be appreciated. Below is the WindowsUpdate.log showing an error communicating with a service:</div>

            Thanks... Found that a couple of days ago, and it didn't work.
<div><br />
<div>I posted the log here because it points to a communication problem with the web service end point, not a local problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My suspicion is this was introduced with the round of updates released on the day Windows 8.1 was released for consumers.</div>

            I'm having the same issues and have yet to find a solution (tried all those mentioned above). I even refreshed Win 8.1 (which, unfortunately, resulted in me having to reinstall all my applications again)&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Immediately after refresh, everything initially seemed to be functioning normally until I went to bed. Woke up the next morning to this problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure if its connected...but opening my device manager now causes Microsoft Management Console to crash as well as a very long delay when accessing Devices and Printers. A problem I also had PRIOR to refreshing Windows 8.1 and a problem that I did NOT
 have immediately after until I went to bed for the night. This seems to be pointing towards an update breaking something. I then uninstalled every Windows update that it let me (it did not let me uninstall 4 of them). Still not fixed.&nbsp;</div>

<li>Upgraded to Windows 8.1</li><li>See the identical errors/failure in Windows Update</li><li>Same weird delay/crashing in both Devices &amp; Printers and in Device Manager.</li></ol>
I believe I've tried all of the boilerplate troubleshooting items.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm absolutely not willing to reinstall my applications, so a refresh is not in the cards for me. (Along with the indication that it doesn't actually solve the problem permanently.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I agree with the comment above that some sort of web service certificate issue is probably involved here. Perhaps one of the updates has messed with these.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And since there seems to be a relation to device manager/devices &amp; printers, perhaps the problematic update is related to specific hardware -- perhaps printer, network or video drivers?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will keep plugging away at this, but if anyone has any additional information I'd love to hear it.</div>

            Same problem here...had it with 8.1 preview. Actually spent time on phone with 2 different people from Microsoft. They could not get Store to upgrade to 8.1 rtm...anyway, somehow I managed to get the update to 8.1rtm by making the website open my STORE
 app...after upgrade &amp; reinstalling all apps, etc, laptop was working better than ever &amp; getting updates. Today, no updates &amp; get the same error message! I tried everything before &amp; don't wish to REFRESH!

            I've got the exact same symptoms. I had done an in-place upgrade from Windows 8.0 to Windows 8.1 on 10/21/2013.
<br />
<br />
On 11/4/2013, I started seeing 80244fff errors when running Windows Update. <br />
<br />
Also, Device Manager would hang for several seconds when I opened it, and in most cases, mmc.exe would crash a short while later.<br />
<br />
Today I went splunking in WindowsUpdate.log and saw:<br />

<br />
So I guess I'll be doing a refresh to see if that buys me some time until Microsoft notices that this is a problem for the masses and puts some freakin R&amp;D resources on it, or someone opens a Sev 1 with PSS because Nov Windows Updates (which have fixes for
 some nasty vulns) can't be applied to their 8.1 hosts. ):<br />

            <p>Question: for the upgrade (laptop) that failed - is the product key that is in-use the one from the factory or the one off the sticker likely stuck to the laptop? &nbsp;They are, unless redone/rebuilt so time after or manually changed, usually pre-installed from
 the factory and using the OEMs VLK. &nbsp;You should change that to the one for that specific system first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The November/etc. builds do allow one to activate with legitimate Windows 7/Windows 8.1 non-volume license keys...</p>

            According to the Activation Page, Windows 10 volume license clients must use a product key from the Volume License portal:





You have a Volume Licensing agreement for 
Windows&nbsp;10 or MSDN subscription




Product key
(Available through the web portal for your program) 






If the machines have COA stickers as suggested, you could try entering it:
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key

            <p>Thanks for replying,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop that wouldn't activate was activated with the product key that was on the sticker underneath the battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the machine (windows 7 pro) was upgraded to Windows 10 (November build) - I tried to use the same product key however get an error message - Unable to to reach activation servers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I then completely rebuilt the laptop onto win 10 build 10586 using the same ISO I used for the upgrade... put in the same windows 7 pro product key that's on the sticker... and it activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the issue is really only occurring when upgrading to the November build....</p>

win32k.sys is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault.<br />

<strong>1.</strong> Check the memory very thoroughly.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check with MSI Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board<br />
and separate device drivers (see driver update methods below).<br />
<br />

Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the vents are clear and that the<br />
fans are working. Even though the temp is OK do not assume heat can't affect the video,<br />
sound or other system functions it those get to hot. Try adding a small fan blowing into<br />
the vents as a test. (Those are mostly for a PC not a laptop.)<br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers,
 memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when<br />
you get to those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />

there are other causes.<br />

You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

    <title>Device or resource &#40;DNS Server&#41; is not reponding in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlrandall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Device or resource &#40;DNS Server&#41; is not reponding in Windows 8.1 RT</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Satellite P855-S5102 laptop with 16GB RAM &amp; 750GB hard drive running Windows 8.1 RT.<br />
My Internet keeps dropping &amp; when I run the Troubleshooter for Internet Connections, I get messages that state the wireless adapter was correctly reset &amp; "Your computer appears to be correctly configured but the device or resource (DNS Server) is not responding."<br />
I checked all of the connections on my Comcast wireless gateway, even changed the cable from the 25 foot monster they gave me to a new 3 foot one.<br />
I also checked the IpConfig setting for Ipv4 &amp; Ipv6 to make sure they were all set to automatic.<br />
I ran the Microsoft Security scanner for viruses &amp; nothing was detected.<br />
I there a way the DNS server can be configured to respond properly?<br />
I'm seriously thinking about upgrding to Windows 8.1 Pro because I really don't like the limitations &amp; functionality of the RT version, and that may correct this issue as well.<br />

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue, and it is only with one user.&nbsp; I can log into the skype instance and I have my voicemail greeting options.&nbsp; I checked and her setup is correct, including the business online 2 plan.&nbsp; When I had the user log into the same client I did,
 the VM greeting option was missing again.&nbsp; I haven't seen much on this issue online, the user is not using a stand alone install, it is the full office suite through o365.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I understand you're using the Skype for Business voice mail service with cloud PSTN, and there is one user cannot see the Voicemail “Change Greeting” option. And you have checked when you had the user log into your client where you can see the option
 for your account, the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if the user can see other options in Voicemail, such as Call Voice Mail or Set Up Voice Mail? For this, please provide us the screenshot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please check if the user can see the Voice mail in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook web app</a> (OWA). For your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-your-voice-mail-b0d849d3-dd36-46b2-b845-ab1f1a72c647?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi Nic.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Collections organizes Photos by date like a timeline.  To remove any you don't want  to choose multiple photos   hover on the picture to show the checkbox and select the ones you want to delete, which will also light up the ability to Select all on any date so you can speed through selectively choosing ones to delete, then when ready choose the Trash can at top of page to delete them all. 
<br />
<br />To spot delete single pictures you can right click to Delete.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<p>well, I am glad I did a trial of your suggestion by saving a photo I did not want, viewing it, then opening the collection, selecting then deleting it.</p>
<p>This photo was erased from my hard drive.</p>
<p>Thus your response does NOT resolve the issue.</p>
<p>I want to remove pictures from the Collection but not delete them from the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather not have this Collection function, I can appreciate it would be perhaps useful for those who know not how to organise themselves, but my 'collections' are in the designated folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After googling/viewing many questions/answers about this and finding nothing suitable, I tried my own suggestion and found it is possible to remove the photos from this collection but you must create an entirely new folder elsewhere (perhaps link it to 'quick
 access') and store ALL your photos in the new folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This App is just a waste of resource which aids in slowing down a pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove this App and still view my pictures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Bring back XP.</p>

            Are you interested in the Photos app at all?  If not then you can always access your Pictures through the User Pictures folder just like before, without using Photos app to manage them at all.  
<br />
<br />You can even restore Windows Photo Viewer from previous editions to WIndows 10 following this tutorial:    <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14312-restore-windows-photo-viewer-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14312-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />Then set it as Default Photo app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.

            If you want to remove images from the Photos app, click the 'See more' menu in the top right corner of the Photos app. Its represented by the three dots (...).
<br />
<br />Click Settings.
<br />
<br />Under the Sources folder, click the X beside the folder folder path. 
<br />
<br />C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Pictures    x
<br />
<br />You can also toggle off the option to show synced photos from your Microsoft OneDrive. 
<br />
<br />If you don't want the Photos app to contain any images at all, you should reset the app. This will remove all pictures, but they will not be deleted from the Pictures folder in your User folder.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Photos
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset

<p>Well no not really, the photo app is quite pathetic to use, unable to determine why only some pictures can be viewed resized larger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having used the "picture and fax viewer" in XP for years, this Win10 version is rather useless and backward, such as one has to search for the info as to which picture you're viewing rather than the info being displayed, a time waster . . it may only be
 a few keystrokes, but why add more actions to obtain what used to be displayed along with the picture?</p>
<p>It seems that Win10 is just so much more work in that many more keystrokes or clicks are required just to do basic navigations around commonly used programs, definitely NOT forward progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>picture/fax viewer not available in the store, so do not know what is available that has the same functions, don't have the time/money/data to waste to download and test all those apps in store and the descriptions to help one decide, are rather useless
 except to inform us of the many issues they might have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously considering buying another New Old Stock XP OS so as to go back to straight forward hassle free computing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand how 'progress' can be such a backward step.</p>

            If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.

<br />You can post back here the Feedback Share link and I'll vote it up with my MVP badge FWIW.

            Can not restore something that was never there, this is a new laptop I use, came with Win10, not familiar with any of the picture apps Microsoft created since XP, up until I met this pathetic version.

            Hi Frank, please go through the steps below to see if any of these options can help you . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

                    <p><u><em>Original Title</em></u><strong>: Automatic updates for Security Updates for...&nbsp; ...KB2518864, KB2572073, KB2633880, KB2656352&nbsp; ...KEEP REPEATING AFTER SUCCESSFUL INSTALL</strong></p>
<p>My system information:&nbsp; Windows XP Home Edition, Version 2002, Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
I recently have had Automatic Updates appear for Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework...&nbsp; ...<span style="font-weight: bold">KB2518864</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold">KB2572073</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">KB2633880</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold">KB2656352</span>.<br />
I click install updates and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">
I watch them install successfully</span>.&nbsp; And then they come right back wanting to install
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">again</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">
again</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">again</span>.&nbsp; UGH!!<br />
<br />
I have read many forums and attempted many fixes, (even the Microsoft Mr. Fixit).&nbsp; I am not too technical and refuse to attempt some of the fixes that had me going and making changes to the registry without knowing exactly what I am doing.&nbsp; I know that making
 one small mistake in the registry can mess up my enitre system.<br />
<br />
I need a <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">simple</span> solution to this annoying problem.&nbsp; Please put the solution in
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">laymen terms</span> for the technically challenged.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any assistance with this.</p>

            Your post is a bit hard to follow but I'm guessing that you deleted administrative user accounts. You will need to fix things from the built-in Administrator account, which cannot be deleted. The first thing to try is Safe Mode. While the built-in Administrator
 account is disabled by default, if there are no other administrative users on the system it may become enabled in Safe Mode. To get into Safe Mode, repeatedly tap the F8 key as the computer is starting up. This will get you to the diagnostic menu where you
 can select Safe Mode. If you see an icon for Administrator on the Welcome Screen, log into that account and fix your errors. See the end of this post for general recommendations about setting up users in Vista.<br />
<br />
Once you have made your changes (hopefully per the recommendations below), log into the extra administrative user account you will have made and disable the built-in Administrator again for security purposes.<br />
<br />
<span>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
</span>If you do <strong><em>not</em> </strong>see the Administrator icon on the Welcome Screen, please post back for further instructions.<br />
<span><br />
</span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">General Recommendations For Setting Up Users In Vista:</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span>

<p>reckon you are hitting the same problem, changes made to how their location based services see some ISPs from the Channel Islands have stopped us from being able to download region locked content, do C&amp;W Guernsey have uk registered isp or have they their

            i tried reactivating windows 8 countless times even in safe mode with networking<br />
<br />
the media pack installed succesfuly but it seems for whatever resaon to think adding it makes my windows 8 install illegal<br />
<br />
what i did was reinstall windows 8 completely activated it backed up my windows install and tried to reinstall media center pack again and im invalid again so restored windows backup and got my activation back<br />
<br />
so everytime i install media center pack it makes it my activation for windows dissaper i tried phone activation that doesnt help now im afraid to install media center<br />
<br />
unrelated note theres one other person i found on twitter https://twitter.com/yasu_hide who seems to have been having same problem so its more then just me atleast ive tried to contact him<br />

            for future refrence should anyone else ever get this it seems if you dont activate windows 8 online before installing media center addon pack activation fails and not even phone reps can activate it<br />
<br />
anyway i did a clean install made sure it was was activted using slui 3 and then installed media pack then did slui 3 again and it stayed activated
<br />
<br />
this has been my experience anyway<br />

<h2>            Upgrade Problems</h2>
                    Tried to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Some problem occurred part way through the upgrade (I was not watching the screen) so it said it was restoring my previous operating system.&nbsp; Not a big deal except now my computer won't start in Windows 7.&nbsp;
 It begins normally, I enter my password, the desktop appears, and then everything stops.&nbsp; The title of the error box is Toaster.exe.&nbsp; The message says "A fatal error occurred.&nbsp; However, mscorees.dll could not be loaded to display the appropriate error message.&nbsp;
 Please reinstall the .Net Framework.&nbsp; How do I do this when I can only start in safe mode?&nbsp; What is the best way for me to get Windows 7 operating again?&nbsp; I have already tried to use Recovery and it says every thing loaded normally, but it still won't start.<br />

            Fixed the problem myself.&nbsp; From Safe Mode, I was able to do a Clean Boot.&nbsp; I repaired the .Net Framework file, tried a regular boot, but it still locked up.&nbsp; Did a Clean Boot again and removed all Dell Data Safe programs.&nbsp; These contain the file Toaster.exe
 and the DSupd.exe file which also occasionally appeared.&nbsp; Tried a regular boot again and all seems to be fine.&nbsp; Maybe in a couple of weeks I will get brave and try to upgrade to Windows 10 again.<br />

            Hi, ANDREWSACKEY
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            I have Windows 10. I too have the same problem being reported by Windows Network Diagnostics. However I have no problems surfing the internet so far. The only problem I find is that there's a time delay between punching the key board and the letters appearing
 on the screen. I don't know anything about configuring proxy server settings.

    <title>Computer Won&#39;t Boot- fails intermittently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dbadger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Won&#39;t Boot- fails intermittently</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I'm having some problems with a PC not booting.&nbsp; About 2/3rds of the time I try to boot, it gets past the post beep but before the Windows splash screen displays, it just shuts off.&nbsp; No error message or anything, the power just cuts off.&nbsp; It may be worth mentioning
 that every attempt to enter the BIOS setup has resulted in it suddenly shutting off.&nbsp; Also, once it does boot up after a couple tries, it runs fine and stays up until I choose to shut it down.<br />
<br />
I'm not an expert with computers, but a co-worker suggested it was either a problem with the power supply or it's overheating.&nbsp; On one of the rare times it booted up fine I installed SpeedFan and it shows the following:<br />
<br />
GPU: 63C<br />
GPU: 51C<br />
Temp1: 48C<br />
Temp2: 41C<br />
Temp3: -55C<br />
Temp1: -48C<br />
Temp2: -48C<br />
Temp3: -48C<br />
CPU: -64C<br />
<br />
If that's correct, then it shouldn't be my CPU overheating, but maybe my GPUs?<br />
<br />
My system is an HP Blackbird, Windows 7, Liquid Cooled CPU, and two NVidia 8800 Ultras that I am not currently running in SLI (turned it off to see if that made a difference).&nbsp; Also, I have not installed any new hardware or programs recently and a full Norton
 scan found nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
Is 63C too hot at idle for an 8800 Ultra?&nbsp; And if the problem is not overheating, what else could be preventing me from booting up?&nbsp; Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Does it have problems booting when it is room temp, been sitting off for hours? Once it is running
<br />
does it seem to function well or does it shut back down?<br />
<br />
If you are doing any over-clocking or over/under-volting stop until the issues are solved.<br />
<br />
Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in the HP
<br />
forums for known issues.<br />

<br />
63C is equal to 145F and normally should not be an issue however it is possible that something<br />
is too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat. Check the heatsink and even the compound
<br />
between the processor and the heatsink. <br />
</p>
<p>Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner?<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help
<br />
of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the
<br />
System Maker's Support.<br />
<br />
===========================================================</p>
<p>Check with these utilities to see if any information can be gathered : Run BlueScreenView
<br />
to see if there have been BlueScreens, and check in MyEventViewer at the time of the shutdown
<br />
(or a few seconds before) to see it the Event Log contains any useful information.<br />
<br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
<strong>BlueScreenView</strong> - Free -&nbsp;scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes,<br />
and displays the information about all crashes in one table.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</span></a><br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen (BSOD) or Event&nbsp;to within a second
<br />
or so of the time of the BSOD or Event&nbsp;to provide more information as to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />
set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the BSOD or Event.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html</span></a><br />
<br />
------------</p>
<p><strong>AppCrashView </strong>- Free -&nbsp;a small utility for Windows Vista and Windows 7 that displays the details
<br />
of all application crashes occurred in your system. The crashes information is extracted from the
<br />
.wer files created by the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component of the operating system every<br />
time that a crash is occurred. AppCrashView also allows you to easily save the crashes list to<br />
text/csv/html/xml file. <br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/app_crash_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/app_crash_view.html</span></a><br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.</strong> (You may or may not be able to see<br />
them if they occur even after doing this depending on the cause.)<br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />
(also Windows 7)<br />

<br />
=========================================<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>The vmkbd entry may be the issue. The vmkbd entry&nbsp;would be from a VMware installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I might suggest is to remove the vmkbd value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the first registry key double-click<em> UpperFilters</em> highlight only<em> vmkbd,&nbsp;</em>then right-click<em> vmkbd</em> and delete
<em>vmkbd </em>&gt; OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a System Restore Point beforehand and restart the computer afterward.</p>
