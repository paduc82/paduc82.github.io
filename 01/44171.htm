<h2>            How to manually remove a corrupted KB file&#63; ...Wider problem with Security Monthly Quality Roundups&#63;</h2>
                    A corrupted KB file has apparently selectively stopped Windows Update from working as it only affects the Security Monthly Quality Roundups, curious? The SFC /scannow process identified KB3033929 with a corrupted SID appears to be the most likely reason
 but I need to be able to remove it manually to prove it is so. I can't go back to an earlier time. I can't use the Programs and Features highlight and remove the said KB because it is corrupted! This started with the October roundup but I had no time to look
 further until now.&nbsp; Now it is the December, 2016 Security Quality Rollup for Windows 7 (KB3207752) that fails to install with code 80073712. Any help appreciated.

            <p>This is a long log but it sheds light on what I suspect is a failing in the Security Monthly Quality Round up, so if you are technically minded, read on!</p>
<p>The suggestion re system restore is appreciated but I only allowed 3.4Gb of storage for backups which is sufficient for 4 backups but as the update fails it sets a restore point so the 4 restore points are all for the current day. Now I can pass on further
 details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SUR log that derives from the CBS log generated from SFC /scannow has now come down to just one file that cannot be repaired. The file in the Windows / winsxs / Manifests folder relates to digital rights management for Microsoft Media Player for a day
 in early February 2015. The file exits in the Manifest folder along with a number of others and they are all the same size for DRM management at 37Kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The significant other point is that I can apply other updates OK and applied a .NET update today from the optional updates no problem. So what has changed to cause the problem with specific critical updates?</p>
<p>I am a lay person but I do note that it is always the same update type that fails: the Security Quality Round up for Windows 7. This started with the September release, then November, then December: currently KB3033929.</p>
<p>I did go into Event Viewer /Custom Views /Administrative Events that gave extra detail:</p>

<p>
</p><p>OK, I don't think there is a great need to dwell on the above technical details there for the record but this is what happened on that day in February 2015: I do video edit and I had helicopter footage which looked awful due to synchronisation problems as
 the blades turned. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched and found a simple solution: use VLC Player with a number of sync options, I did and it worked so I retired Microsoft Media player on that day, it was duly unticked in Programs and Features, Windows Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first used my Video Edit suite in 2009 on this laptop I had to go online to some server to unlock DRM somehow, so that I could create my own DVDs, so I assume that however it is done the DRM management vetting with finer criteria applied by the Security
 Monthly Round up does not allow for this kind of unlocking, but that is of course lay speculation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect Microsoft are using the new Monthly Security Round up to enforce a more exacting standard for files to be even more sure that only the squeaky clean can be rewarded with updates, only they appear to have gone a bit too too far and may need to back-track
 a bit, so that critical security updates will install for all! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be interested to know if any of the other 37 views included some who have found similar problems to me. It seems over the top to be stopped from getting critical updates because of me viewing my legitimate home DVD in February 2015.&nbsp; That is all
 I can conclude for the moment and if I am wrong I will hold my hand up!</p>

            <p>I have fixed Windows Updates for the smaller original HDD for this laptop and brought it up to date. I have also fixed Windows Updates on another computer that is used infrequently, then I returned to my laptop and put the larger drive back in and went through
 things again and I can confirm the following: of real interest if you are unlucky to be in this situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE SITUATION</p>
<p>All your Windows 7 Updates go in the normal way except for the new Monthly Quality Roundups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have run System File Checker SFC /scannow ...several times then downloaded and run the System Update Tool a number of times ..slower than SFC but clearly a more thorough version of SFC and well worth doing, more times again and it shows that there is
 still one or more file that it cannot fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE REALITY</p>
<p>You have come to the end of the line. You cannot go on-line with Windows safely, as all the security threats not patched are sure to get you sooner or later. On another computer or a dual boot Linux session you can check periodically for searches that offer
 some hope to Windows 7 users such as a step by step manual repair of the Windows 7 Component Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>GLIMERS OF LIGHT - ONE</p>
<p>The most helpful advice that I have seen, if you are one of the few Windows 7 users with an actual Windows 7 installation disk, is to do an Upgrade Repair in situ ...worth researching further but I am not in that group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GLIMERS OF LIGHT - TWO</p>
<p>If you have an earlier backup than that of the date of the file creation of the manifest file that the SUR log identifies as 'not repairable' or are able to bring an earlier smaller drive back to fully updated and transfer that disk image to your current
 larger drive, you have a way forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HARD TIMES</p>
<p>The annoying thing is that any backup made for your disk after the corruption happened, that could have been on the day that the file was created and could have been years ago but you never knew because only now with the new Quality Monthly Roundups that
 apply a finer level of checking the Windows 7 Component Store, does the problem come to light.&nbsp; Please bear in mind that I am a lay computer user who has scoured the Internet to reach this conclusion. If you know any different please take the time to inform
 this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your computer is running perfectly except for this issue... it does not matter one iota, you are better to save time and effort now by making the painful decision to re-install Windows 7 or upgrade to Windows 10 if you 'want' to do that but it will cost
 you finacially and I am suspicious of privacy issues and loss of personal control.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are reading this now the majority of Windows 7 users, I expect, will have already made the decision not to upgrade to Windows 10 and see this as a source of pressure to comply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if reinstalling Windows, please be careful to back up all your personal data first. Do not trust to luck and I hope that this will be of help to all Windows 7 users as it is a 'dog waiting to bite you!' If you do not back up your C - drive while
 Windows Updates are still fully working, you are subject to the loss of Windows 7 safe use the moment this problem strikes!</p>

            <p>AN URGENT NOTE FOR ANY ....'IT-CANT-HAPPEN-TO-ME' ...WINDOWS 7 USERS'</p>
<p>
</p><p>WORKING WINDOWS 7 QUALITY MONTHLY ROUNDUP USERS ...YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE SUFFICIENT MEMORY ALLOCATED TO SYSTEM RESTORE FOR A FEW RESTORE POINTS BEFORE THE LAST MONTHLY QUALITY UPDATE WENT IN .&nbsp; I think that it would be prudent to allocate 27Gb to System Restore,
 if you have plenty of memory to spare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also DO NOT TRY TO REINSTALL A FAILED QUALITY MONTHLY ROUNDUP WITHOUT INCREASING YOUR SYSTEM RESTORE MEMORY OR DELETING SOME INTERMEDIATE POINTS IF YOUR ALLOCATION IS ALMOST FULL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check how things stand and perhaps remove some intermediate restore points so that you will not loose a restore point from the previous month as a few more have to be created in trying to manually install the latest Quality Monthly Roundup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A STRATEGY FOR LOW SYSTEM RESTORE MEMORY ALOCATION USERS</p>
<p>Periodically check your restore points and delete some to retain at least one from the previous month. I think that if you try to turn off System Restore in the hope that you would not loose the previous month's restore point, you would loose all your restore
 points, so you can't do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some light computer users could get by with a lower System Restore Memory allocation value but be very, very sure that you have at least a few restore points going back into the previous month. You may not have much spare memory to allocate, so a change
 in thinking is likely needed to create less manual restore points. People who have many Apps that regularly update, setting restore points in the process, may need to change settings to...'ask to update', instead of 'automatic updates' and similar strategies.</p>

            <p>Since I made the last post, which has implications for all Windows 7 users, I have tried to walk this problem in the moccasins of everyone involved and I have concluded that this issue could cause a lot of friction between Microsoft and its customer base,
 so I propose the following sort:</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>MORAL OBLIGATION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT</p>
<p>If a 'small' issue in the Windows 7 component store, went undetected for possibly years because Windows Updates worked and it was not until September 2016, due to a change of depth of checking of the Windows 7 Component Store by the new Monthly Quality Roundups,
 stopped critical security updates for some users: ... the standard recourse to System Restore, as already put forward as the correct solution, simply will not work. Only a restore point before the corruption will work and that could have required a System
 Restore Memory Allocation, far exceeding any practical working computer system, to exist.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>A group of Windows 7 users with this issue will be considered as User Group 1. People in User Group 1 may have third party full disk image copies going back over a year but even that may not save them from a full Windows 7 re-install, as they must have a
 full disk image from before the unfixable event happened in the Windows 7 Component Store.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>All Windows 7 users fall into User Group 2. User Group 2 users currently have their computers running perfectly with the Monthly Quality Roundups working without problems. Now consider that a corruption event happens to any user worldwide in any future month.
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So that System Restore is viable, at least one full month's worth of restore points must exist, going back beyond the last Monthly Quality Roundup, as this covers the possibility that the undetected Windows 7 Component Store corruption, not recoverable by
 SFC/SUR, it is prudent, as a lay person speaking from my own experience, with qualifiers as in the last post, to have a System Restore Memory Allocation of 27Gb, which is likely also to be impractical for many users in this group, the group of all Windows
 7 users, faced with the SFC/SUR unrepairable condition after the earliest available System Restore point has been applied.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>MORAL OBLIGATION SOLUTION</p>
<p>Offer all Windows 7 users caught out by the 'SFC/SUR unable to repair -System Restore ineffective' scenario a free upgrade to Windows 8 where the DISM repair option of the component store can be done or make a Windows 7 DISM available or a Windows 7 disk
 image available to permit some sort of component store, in-situe repair, followed by an option to return to Windows 7, for those more comfortable with that.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The suggestions that I made for the User Group 2 people - all current Windows 7 users, is to conserve at least some monthly restore points within the available System Restore Memory Allocation, is an added aggravation that all users can do without, as it
 would be commercially damaging for Microsoft due to alienation of its customer base and from a National Security standpoint, if the Microsoft official advice, as a result of highlighting this problem, comes down to turning off automatic updates, as Internet
 fraud could soar.</p>

<p>SYSTEM RESTORE MEMORY WINDOWS 7 (64 bit vs 32 bit)</p>
<p>Microsoft System Restore 64 bit on my Desktop and 32 bit on my Laptop at least ....had a markedly different thirst for memory, with many more restore points for the Gigabytes allocated on the 32 bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium System Restore. Having
 said that I now notice that my 32 bit Laptop now has acquired a taste for a lot more memory. This may be a glitch in System Restore on my Laptop, so perhaps wise to go to System Restore, close off all existing restore points and start again. &nbsp;I understand
 that it is difficult to pin down just how many restore points you get for the Gigabytes of System Restore Memory involved, as the right memory allocation will depend on the size of your software footprint and how much difference has occurred between successive
 system restore points. My new rule of thumb is 9% of your H.D.D. capacity but it could be that your own need is either greater or lesser.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>GOOD NEWS</p>
<p>The good news is that what I said before about having sufficient restore points available to reliable have coverage back into the previous month before the last
 post) ...i.e. those who might have had an internal corruption in the Windows Component Store but had never known about as Windows Updates worked post minor corruption until these specific&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Monthly Quality
 Roundups started, will already know that they were out of luck and done either an 'above and beyond' fix, or reinstalled Windows 7 or moved to Windows 10 or Linux. Those without problems with Windows Updates now can rest assured that there was no 'SFC / scannow
 or SUR tool - unfixable corruption' in the Windows Component Store, stemming from anything greater than the previous month, so the System Restore Show Stopper Issue, has effectively gone away. ...OK for moderator to close this issue now as I have answered
 the problem by myself, not bad for a lay computer user!</span></p>

            Check to ensure there is disk activity (look at the hard disk LED light to confirm. If there is, keep waiting. If setup goes beyond 2 to 3 hours, try the following steps.
<br />Power down the computer. Unplug it, then wait 20 seconds.
<br />If you are using a laptop, remove the battery if the option is available.
<br />Disconnect it from the Internet (unplug Ethernet and/or turn off Wi-Fi).
<br />Plug it again, ensure it remains disconnected from the Internet then start computer.
<br />See if it completes setup.
<br />If setup completes and you see the desktop with the ability to click Start and launch programs, proceed to reconnect to the Internet.

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t allow me to save or edit files even after changing permissions</h2>
                    Every time I try to save any type of file to a preexisting folder, it tells me that I don't have permission to save there and to contact a system administrator. I am the system administrator, and I've already given myself full control of the folders that
 I am attempting to save in. I read a post that suggested that I try changing my account type to administrator, but I prefer to run my computer from a standard account, and it's too much of a hassle to change accounts every time I want to download a funny picture.
 Is there any way for me to give my standard account permission to edit these folders and then actually be able to save things in them? I'm extremely frustrated with Windows 10 and need some new ideas before my patience runs out.

            Hi ManojitSarkar
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Login to your account on Web portal and verify that your purchase has gone through (look into Purchase history) and your account is updated with the info. 
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>
<br />
<br />2. Open your Skype of desktop, sign out and sign-in again. The credit should reflect now.
<br />
<br />3. Most likely you are using a different ID to login. You need to use your Skype ID not mail ID to login to Skype. Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID seems to have been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. So, when you use your mail ID to login, it gets into new Skype ID. Your Microsoft account, in this case, gets 2 Skype IDs attached - this new ID which is default now and your old Skype ID. 
<br />
<br />Just use your old Skype as user name. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have sent you private message with more details, but basically the problem seems to be that you bought credit to different account than you make calls from. So it will be better if you contact customer support to refund your order.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64bit STOP&#58; 0x0000007e Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I was hoping someone could help with my Windows 7 64bit Pro issue.</p>
<p>The new build kit is as follows.</p>
<p>Asus P7H55-M PRO mother board, xfx hd5670 GPU, Intel Core 7 860 S1156, 4GB ram, 1TB Seagate SATA drive.</p>
<p>I am getting a BSOD most times that I start the PC. It will normally be after the 4&nbsp;Windows logo segments come together. The computer will then go into a reboot loop of offering repair or start normally. Repair sometimes works but not always.</p>
<p>The BSOD displays</p>
<p>STOP: 0X0000007E (0XFFFFFFFFC0000005, 0XFFFFF80001EA3B74, 0XFFFFF88002316968, 0XFFFFF880023161C0)</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this is a hardware issue as I have re-installed this computer twice, each time re-formatting the HDD and still get this issue. I believe I have the latest drivers for all the installed components.</p>
<p>Incidentally, my AV is Trend Internet Security 2010.</p>
<p>I did manage to get a DMP file but do not know how to add it to this post.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Does the machine boot ok into safe mode? I believe that the 7E error is related to video driver problems. If you can, uninstall the video drivers while in safe mode and try another driver, maybe an older one..

I get the BSOD mini dump quite often upon re-starting my Asus 64-bit Windows 7 laptop. This has been a chronic problem since buying it in January. Drivers updated, etc. Others commenting that clean reinstall didn't fix, and I'd like to avoid that. I'm interested
 in your solution but before trying wanted to confirm that your blue screen situation was similar / the same as mine? Thank you</div>

</p><p>I know how important this is to you. However, there is no option to unlink your Skype and Microsoft account. Since the Skype account is already a Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference, you can check this FAQ link: <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa12060/can-i-merge-or-unlink-my-skype-and-microsoft-accounts?q=unlink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Can I merge or unlink my Skype and Microsoft accounts?</a></strong></p>

            <p>You must have an Xbox Live Gold subscription to play online, with Xbox 1. De-select 'Make this console my Home console'. This forces someone with a Gold subscription, to log, in order to play online games. Also under settings request your console to ask for your Microsoft password or PIN. It is illegal for your roommates to use your property without your permission. If they continue to abuse, it's time to move out. Maybe move in with a bunch of girls who tend to be more civilized. </p>

                    <p>I am having blurry fonts when in any app, or installer (uninstaller), or especially in the windows recovery backup tool maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other fonts work well on windows 10, but when upgrading from windows 8.1 a few hours ago, some fonts are small, and blurry. I already did a windows update, and everything is up to date. New Asus Zenbook laptop purchased 2 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See picture below. It's almost as if the font isn't clear/Poor quality around the text.</p>

            You can always try running the "Adjust ClearType text" program, just type it in the search and you should find it, I tested it and it did change the font clearness in the installer window at least. It does not however change text size.

            <p>Thank you.&nbsp; This eventually worked - I had to attach a USB mouse and restore to an earlier date - first time it didn't complete so I had to repeat.&nbsp; I used the power down 3 times to get advanced repair settings up.

            Hi Karen
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Press Windows key + A
<br />
<br />On the Resulting Flyout, if you cannot see the Tablet Mode Button, click 'Expand'
<br />
<br />If the Tablet Mode Button is not gray, click it so it becomes gray
<br />
<br />This will turn off tablet mode
<br />
<br />2,
<br />To stop this from happening again:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Tablet Mode
<br />
<br />Set the top option to 'Use Desktop Mode'
<br />
<br />Set the second option to 'Don't ask me and don't switch'

    <title>Windows 10, images stretched in Windows Explorer preview window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielaco22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, images stretched in Windows Explorer preview window</h2>
                    <p>I have a computer which some months ago started giving me various problems. One of those was that all of a sudden the portrait previews in Windows Explorer started showing as landscape. Now I have a new computer and it's giving me the same problem. It seems
 it wasn't a problem of the old computer but maybe of a Windows update? I work the whole day with images and this problem gives me a lot of headaches...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enclose an example. I covered most of the images for privacy, but you can clearly see that the selected image is portrait while on the right window it shows as landscape. This is expecially bad when I need to check images with people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how to fix it? Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Malik, thank you for your answer. The problem of that post is different, but it's a visualization problem all the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must admit I'm a little reluctant to do a system restore. The computer has only two months, and I'm "recreating" all my work tools daily, so I'm sure I would lose a lot of things and settings I made recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add that the problem started as soon as I bought the computer. Not sure if the exact day or a few days later (when a Windows 10 update was released).&nbsp; So, I'm not even sure it would resolve, because probably the system would be restored to a way
 when the problem was already present. </p>

<p>Hello Daniela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A misconfiguration with the file association is possibly causing the preview issue in
<em><strong>File Explorer</strong></em>. I will need additional information to properly isolate the causes of your concern. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Is the preview issue isolated to a specific image file type?</li><li>Can you tell me the default program for opening image files on your Windows 10 device?</li><li>What is the current <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 system? You can find this information by clicking the
About your PC</span>, press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>, and then scroll down to
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend performing a clean boot to isolate which program is possibly causing the preview issue. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts
 that occur when you install a program or an update or when you use your Windows device. Kindly refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">support article</a></strong> for the steps on how to perform a clean boot

<p>Devlin, thank you for your help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I'm in the clean boot mode but the problem is still there. I took a screenshot of my Windows specifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 I don't get any message</p>
<p>2 This is very interesting. Let me start by saying that I work with images so in the "Images" folder I have personal photos, while in "Documents" I have various folders with images I work with. I thought it was the Images forlder which was affected, but
 now I've realized that the problem is only with the photos I shoot. No matter what camera I used, no matter if they are in the Images folder or in Documents. How can that be? I checked in the old computer where I also had some personal photos made with the
 smartphone and those are affected too. </p>
<p>3 I never use it because I work with photoshop and I preview images only the the Window Explorer. The name should be "photos" and the icon is made by two mountains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thak you again. I really hope to be able to solve the problem because it's slowing my work a lot</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot sync Dualshock 4 with PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevormerrill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot sync Dualshock 4 with PC</h2>
                    I've never really used my Bluetooth because I've never had a use for it, but I just got a PS4 controller and want to use it on my PC, but when I go to pair it, my Bluetooth search just endlessly searches for devices. I'm holding the PS button and Share
 button until the light on the controller blinks a bunch. My computer says that Bluetooth is enabled and all of the little check boxes are checked in settings and it says all the drivers are up to date and it is working properly. It just can't FIND anything
 for some reason! I would have thought that other bluetooth devices that are on would also pop up, but right now there is absolutely nothing. I am running Win7 on a Gigabyte motherboard. It's a custom PC, so I can't give a model number or anything for the computer
 itself. Also, the computer recognizes the controller when it is plugged in via USB. It ironically recognizes it as a wireless controller, despite the fact it has to be plugged in to use. I also just checked services.msc and it says it is enabled and automatic.

and any potential suggestions may be covered in the article - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/how-use-ps4-controller-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Unfortunately the article really only covers micro USB plugin, which I can get to work fine. My cable just isn't long enough, so I really need it to be wireless. I feel like it may be a bigger issue than just the controller though because my bluetooth
 adapter just continuously searches without finding anything at all. Shouldn't it at least finish it's search at one point and either find something or not? I've also spent a ton of time looking for other people with specific PS4 controller issues and nobody
 seems to have one, so that makes me think its more my PC bluetooth than anything.<br />

            Ah! I was thinking the Bluetooth&nbsp; came with the controller, and lost track a bit when I read -<br />
<i>"It ironically recognizes it as a wireless controller, despite the fact it has to be plugged in to use."</i><br />
which made me think the controller did not function properly when plugged in either.<br />
Didn't really read carefully enough, did I ? <br />
<br />
So you are using a motherboard with built in Wi-fi/Bluetooth ?&nbsp; You mention&nbsp; "other bluetooth devices that are on" are not active either.&nbsp;
<br />
You have installed the most recent Win7 drivers Gigabyte has for that model motherboard on their web site (not though Device Manager) ?
<br />
<br />
Have you read the following ?<br />

    <title>Adding the &#34;move window&#34; function in the the Task Bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flyingmonkey38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding the &#34;move window&#34; function in the the Task Bar</h2>
                    In Windows XP, there was a previous option of moving the&nbsp;window when right clicking on an application in the taskbar.&nbsp; This was especially helpful when using dual monitors, one as a primary and ocassionally using the secondary.&nbsp; When the second monitor
 is off, applications still load in that space, so the move function in the taskbar, was a quick way to get the application back into the primary monitor.&nbsp; For the most part, I enjoy the new task bar (except for the removal of quick launch, which fortuantely
 has a workaround).<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get the move function back when right clicking on an application?&nbsp; The workaround I use now is using keyboard shortcuts, but takes more time and requires memorizing the shortcut (alt-space, down arrow, hold direction arrow wanted).

<h2>            Experiencing frequent Blue Screens  Bugcheck was&#58; 0x0000009f</h2>
                    <p>original title: Experiencing frequent BSOD's.&nbsp; Bugcheck was: 0x0000009f </p>
<p>My computer keeps rebooting with the following bugcheck reported.&nbsp; It has happened 24 times just today.&nbsp; It seems to happen when the PC is in sleep mode.</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Here's the Bugcheck report from the Event Viewer:&nbsp; The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. The bugcheck was: 0x0000009f (0x0000000000000004, 0x0000000000000258, 0xfffffa8003c5d680, 0xfffff80000b9c510). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report
 Id: 021811-10748-02.</p>
<p>Some more details:&nbsp; I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T400.&nbsp; It had Vista Ultimate installed on it.&nbsp; I have just upgraded it to Windows 7 Ultimate, 64 bit.&nbsp; I thought I was performing a clean install, but I see that I missed the opportunity to reformat the drive
 before the install.&nbsp; (To get the clean install, I first did the upgrade without registering my key, then repeated it to force a clean install.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I got Windows 7 64-bit installed, I installed Lenovo's System Update utility and let it install all of the appropriate drivers for Windows 7.&nbsp; I also made sure that my bios and drivers were up to date prior to beginning to upgrade to Windows 7.</p>
<p>There are several other oddities going on with this machine, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; For instance, it will not shutdown.&nbsp; It gets stuck at the 'Windows is shutting down..." and never finishes.&nbsp; I have to force a power off.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; After the Bugcheck, I notice that about 2 minutes later, there is also the following VSS error:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error querying for the IVssWriterCallback interface. hr = 0x80070005, Access is denied.</p>
<p>. This is often caused by incorrect security settings in either the writer or requestor process.</p>
<p>Operation:</p>
<p>Gathering Writer Data</p>
<p>Context:</p>
<p>Writer Class Id: {e8132975-6f93-4464-a53e-1050253ae220}</p>
<p>Writer Name: System Writer</p>
<p>Writer Instance ID: {9bff8d6a-a6be-4082-ae0a-c6d6480d4e98}</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; My system doesn't seem to be able to create Restore Points.&nbsp; It stopped creating them after just 2 had been created.&nbsp; I tried disabling it (thus deleting all that had been created), turned it back on and tried to create just one, but it never finishes
 creating the restore point.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; We have a D-Link DNS-323 NAS attached to our network.&nbsp; Windows 7 reported that it did not have a driver for this device.&nbsp; So, I downloaded it from D-Link and tried to install it.&nbsp; The install ended saying it could not install the driver.&nbsp; However, it
 does appear to have been installed because if I try to update the driver from Device Manager, I'm told it is already installed.&nbsp; I tried to uninstall the driver, but that operation never completes.&nbsp; I have a Dell 9100 running Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I installed
 the very same NAS driver on it successfully.&nbsp; There have been no BSODs occurring on that machine.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I decided to upgrade to Windows 7 is because I was having trouble in Vista with not being able to create restore points, with a similar VSS error occurring.&nbsp; I tried restoring my Vista system from prior backups that were not exhibiting
 the restore point problem several times, but each time the restore point problem recurred.&nbsp; I thought I might as well just upgrade to Windows 7, thinking I would do away with the restore point problem.</p>
<p>I am willing to do a clean install of Windows 7 again that includes the c drive reformat, if you think that would help.&nbsp; However, since I purchased the upgrade of Windows 7 and I HAVE registered my key, I need to know how to go about doing the clean install.&nbsp;
 I have not yet created the rescue DVDs for Windows 7.&nbsp; If I create them, will I be able to use them to do a clean install that includes the complete reformat of my c: drive?</p>
<p>However, if you have some suggestions for me that might avoid having to do the clean install again, I would really appreciate that.&nbsp; I already have about 3-4 days invested in resetting up this PC.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for you help!</p>

<p>To try to find the cause of the BSODs it may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>

<p><a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-67046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-67046</a></p>
<p>If problems&nbsp;persist you could try just&nbsp;uninstalling the ThinkVantage Active Protection software.</p>
<p>If the BSODs then cease can you check if the&nbsp;VSS errors also resolve.</p>

<p>I've installed the driver update (I checked again, System Update doesn't find this later version, but your link works).&nbsp; It is too early to tell if the BSODs have stopped.&nbsp; They seemed to happen only when the system was asleep.</p>
<p>I am still getting VSS errors and I am not able to shut down the PC without forcing it down.&nbsp; Installs won't complete...I think because restore points can't be created.&nbsp; I allowed ThinkVantage update of the Power Manager (it wasn't even opening before, it
 does now and seems to set the settings properly, because the settings in the System for power management have the settings I just made in the ThinkVantage Power Manager to sleep after 10 mins.</p>
<p>I tried forcing the system to sleep to see if I would see a reboot.&nbsp; I didn't.&nbsp; However, I was then unable to get the system out of sleep mode.&nbsp; Actually, I'm not sure it was sleeping because I could see activity on the hard drive the entire time it was
 supposed to be asleep.&nbsp; The only way I could get it back was to force a shutdown and the turn it on again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the errors I am seeing now:</p>

<p>auggy,</p>
<p>I decided that so much was messed up that I would be better off to just begin again.&nbsp; (BTW, the BSODs were still continuing, even with the updated ThinkVantage Active Protection software).</p>
<p>Thus far, I've reinstalled Win 7, including formatting of my C: drive, and set up simple things like browsers and getting files copied over.&nbsp; Thus far, there is just 1 VSS error.&nbsp; It happened a while ago, so I don't know what caused it.</p>
<p>Now I've installed Lenovo's System Update (oh, that one did generate a VSS error - same one, 8194, but I did get a restore point for the System Update install).&nbsp; I am now downloading and installing several updates (but I am omitting the Active Protection
 for now).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's see what happens.&nbsp; I'm hoping that restarting with a fully formatted drive will solve the problems.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your help.</p>
<p>I notice that Lenovo recommends many Windows Updates as part of the system updates.&nbsp; I don't know whether&nbsp;I should be installing them or just depending upon Microsoft's Windows Update to keep my Windows system up to date.&nbsp; Got any recommendations?</p>

            You can also try to reset your computer using Media Creation Tool. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section"Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "

<br />
<br />Note - You will get the option to keep your files. But it will remove third party apps including Microsoft Office which will need to be reinstalled. Default Windows 10 apps will be automatically installed. But non-defaults Windows 10 apps will need to be reinstalled.

<h3> johnrovere  say:</h3>
<h2>            New&#47;Existing Xbox Live Account Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a feeling that I know the answer to this but I am taking a shot in the dark here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Xbox Live Account that is associated to a Gmail email address.&nbsp; I recently purchased a family subscription to O365 for a year and got a new Outlook.com email address.&nbsp; My original Gmail address account has a ton of purchased games and saved game
 data on it that I want to move to the new Outlook.com account. I know you cannot move the games or data, but I would think that I would be able to associate the existing account with the new Outlook.com account, but it seems the new account already has an
 Xbox Live account and auto-generated Gamer Tag associated with it so when I try to add the Outlook.com alias to the Gmail Xbox account I get an already exists error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any options here to accomplish my goal? I want to get rid of the Gmail account altogether and just use the Outlook account for everything without having to purchase my games again and lose my saved game data. Can the Xbox profile associated with
 my Outlook.com account be deleted so I can add the alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the Microsoft doesn't want people selling gamer tags and saved game data, but they should also assist people when they are trying to use their products and purchase their subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the Forums. Unfortunately there would be no way to use the Outlook email with the Xbox account being that it already has a Gamertag linked to it. In this case you would simply need to create a new Microsoft email (do not
 log into Xbox or create a gamertag for it) and then replace the primary alias with this new email address.

<p>You should be able to change the email address associated with your gamertag.&nbsp; You can do that here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/profile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/profile/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click the "Manage how you sign into microsoft" and in there you should be able to change the primary email address associated with your accounts.&nbsp; Set your new email address as the primary.&nbsp; Then to double check you can remove the profile from your console
 (not the games or save data) and just re-download the profile and make sure you use the new email address to make sure it correctly recognizes it.</p>

<p>That is unfortunate. Is it possible to delete my new Outlook.com account altogether, then recreate it without linking to a gamertag?</p>

<p>The problem is this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not that the outlook.com account already has a gamertag attached to it (unless you signed into an xbox console or xbox.com with it) is the only way that you would get a gamer tag attached to a MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Outlook.com is a MS account and your Gmail account is a MS account so you can not merge the two accounts this is why when you are trying to add your Outlook.com email to your Gmail MS account it is saying that it is already taken because
 it is already a MS account and you can not merge the two accounts together.</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Notifications (updated)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Various balloons pop up in the notification/Action Center area that instruct, for example, to "tap to choose what happens with removable drives." Yet when those prompts are clicked/tapped, they vanish, providing no options ... so what's the point??</p>
<p>
</p><p>**************&nbsp; update&nbsp; ***********</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now a <strong>right-click </strong>on a balloon prompts to click on "go to notifications settings."&nbsp; Perhaps this was recently pushed in an update;&nbsp; don't recall seeing it earlier.&nbsp; That's an improvement, but for removable drive notifications, the prompt
 should point to the AutoPlay settings page, where the options for those drives can be chosen.</p>

            <p>Thanks.&nbsp; I am aware of that approach, but it doesn't address the issue.&nbsp; Here's how it's functioning in Windows 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Configure the removable drive to open File Explorer, and it does just that.&nbsp; No notification is seen in Action Center.</p>
<p>Configure it to TAKE NO ACTION and there's also no notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Configure it to ASK and a notification pops up, but clicking/tapping it does not ask.&nbsp; The notification vanishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So it appears the the ASK choice is not operating as it should, which is to pop up a box with choices for the user.</strong></p>
<p>The balloon states:&nbsp; "tap to choose what happens with removable drives."&nbsp;&nbsp; Do that, and the notification vanishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a legitimate bug.</p>

<h2>            Issue with Microsoft Mahjong Daily Challenges on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Microsoft Mahjong Daily Challenges</p>
<p>Just wondering if there is a glitch on the January 28th "Match Attack" category.&nbsp; I usually have no problem with most of the challenges, but this one has stumped me.&nbsp; Finding 50 matches in 2 minutes, 20 seconds seems to be impossible.&nbsp; Did anyone else experience
 a problem?</p>

            Assuming you are a home user, A repair install should remove all the existing policies
<br />Try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.
