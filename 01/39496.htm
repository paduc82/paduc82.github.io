<h2>            I have a Toshiba laptop &#40;Satellite A505&#41; w&#47;Windows 7</h2>
                    I have tried repeatedly to install an update for:&nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1 for x64-based Systems (KB976932)&nbsp;&nbsp; Download size: 73.6 MB - 892.6 MB.&nbsp; Each time I attempt to install this particular update, it fails to do so and I get an&nbsp; error message.&nbsp; All
 other updates always work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
And the current error msg is: <br />
<br />
"Windows Update_800F081F" "Windows Update_dt000"&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am a f.time student and don't have a lot of time to figure out how to fix this- I am not a PC 'techie-type' -- can you help figure this out?!&nbsp; Many thanks!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you in fixing the issue.</p>
<p><br />
Please follow the below methods and check the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to perform a Clean Boot to prevent any conflicting third party applications from interfering with your computer.</p>
<p>Once the computer is in clean boot mode, you need to install the Service Pack 1.</p>
<p>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: You need to follow Step 7 from the article mentioned above to get the computer back to Normal Startup after performing all the steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:<br />
</p>
<p>Steps to follow before you install Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 from the Microsoft Download Center:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505743</a></p>
<p>Warning: Before you Install SP 1, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing data on your computer being deleted. This data includes personal data, settings, hardware driver information, and software programs. If a worst
 case scenario occurs, you may have to reinstall all programs. Make sure that you back up personal data to disks or to other external storage devices before you perform an in-place upgrade.</p>
<p><br />
Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reference:</p>

<p>Hi Hakim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When did the issue start? Were there any changes made on your computer before the issue started? What are the make and model of your keyboard and mouse? In the meantime, we recommend that you boot your computer in safe mode so we can troubleshoot the issue.
 To do so, kindly follow these steps: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start your system.</li><li>After your computer shows its original equipment manufacturer's logo, perform a hard shut down by pressing and holding the power button until your computer shuts down.</li><li>Repeat steps 1 and 2.</li><li>Start your system again. This time, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Startup Settings</strong>, then click <strong>restart</strong>.</li><li>When your computer restarts, press the corresponding key for safe mode to boot your computer in safe mode.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're in safe mode, check if the issue persists. If the issue persists, we recommend that you temporarily use a different mouse and keyboard to troubleshoot the issue. If the issue started after a recent update, try to uninstall it. To do so, follow
 the steps under <strong>How do I remove an installed update?</strong> in this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update: FAQ</a>. Once done, check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to us once you've tried the steps that we have provided.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue. &nbsp;Im regard to your steps, I have attempted to start in safe mode but the issue does persist. &nbsp;Also, attempting to use a different keyboard and mouse get the same result. &nbsp;I am locked out of my pc. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>USB keyboard and mouse not working after motherboard change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgejakob  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB keyboard and mouse not working after motherboard change</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed my motherboard to an ASUS maximus VI Impact, keeping all the other components the same with the hope of making a m-ITX build. Now when i turn the machine on windows boots normally but on the welcome screen where i type in my password to
 log in, the keyboard and mouse appear to lose power and stop working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the USB ports and think its unlikely a hardware problem as both the keyboard and mouse work in the Bios menu. Also, I've messed around with legacy and USB setting in the Bios to no avail. I've a feeling i need to install the new motherboard
 drivers to enable USB support but I cant do this without logging in and the motherboard doesn't have a PS/2 port so that rules out using a PS/2 keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading around I think it might have something to do with the version of windows installed on the SSD I'm using (It's a windows 7 home premium 64 bit OEM version) and different sources say that this can only be tied to one motherboard. Is it worth
 trying to do a clean install of windows or will that be a waste of time with my current version? I'm out of ideas, please help.</p>

            <p>Hello George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, please answer the questions mentioned below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>How did you reinstall Windows on the new motherboard?</li><li>Did you receive installation DVD from the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM version of Windows&nbsp; is dependent on the hardware ID. If you change the motherboard of the computer, the hardware ID changes and you will not be able to install/work with the OEM version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you connect another mouse and keyboard to the computer and check if that works. If the different set of mouse and keyboard does not work with the computer, you might consider reinstalling Windows. For information on reinstalling Windows,
 you can get in touch with the OEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 upgrade on refurbished ASUS S200E notebook - Activation error code&#58; 0xC004C003 &#40;key blocked&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Basic facts</strong></p>
<p>The upgrade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded a couple of days ago from a properly licensed version of Windows 8.1.</li><li>Asked during install to input product key; skipped it as didn't have the key to hand.
</li><li>Tried to activate post-upgrade but received error to say key blocked.</li></ul>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contacted ASUS tech support. </li><li>Told to register laptop online; registered laptop. </li><li>Then told no service for refurbished laptops so <strong>no key</strong>.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>on the basis that: (a) MS say that they will upgrade any compatible device running a genuine copy of Win 7 / 8 / 8.1, and (b) my device is compatible, and (c) it was running a genuine copy of Win 8.1,
<strong>then </strong>will MS provide me with a key given that ASUS has refused to?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't have an "Activate now" button; the Activation tab on the Update and Security screen invites me to change my product key but that is all.</p>

<h2>            Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 7 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>When shutting down my computer, it went to installing updates.&nbsp; When I turned on my computer the next day, it will not boot and this message appears on the screen&nbsp; " Reboot and Select&nbsp; proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press
 a key".&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried my recovery or boot disc and I then get the message that states:&nbsp; "The version of System Recovery Options is not compatible with the version of windows you are trying to repair. Try using a recovery disc that is compatible with this
 version of Windows".&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this mean the computer tried to update to Windows 10?.&nbsp; I do not want Windows 10 and I really don't want to reload Windows 7 and lose my files.&nbsp; Help?</p>

            <p>Same Problem here,</p>
<p>Windows 7 PRO SP1 64bit DE DSP 611 DVD</p>
<p>Using AMD FM2 Asus F2A85X UEFI Boot, updated to the latest firmware</p>
<p>I bought a new SSD to reinstall Windows 7 because I had a ssd failure in mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used a completly new Samsung 850 Pro SDD for a clean install of W7 PRO</p>
<p>After the initial installation of the OS , installing the Hardware driver, there were 235 Updates installed.</p>
<p>Rebooting the PC shown the "Reboot...." Message again and a the DVD also recovery failed as described from Mark Sears</p>
<p>I've connected my original SSD via an external adapter to another PC and the drive worked fine, all data are present, the drive reports no errors, the file system is clean, the Partion table is set to Primary, but replacing the original drive into the PC
 results in to boot error again, at the moment I've no glue how to install W7 PRO again on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems there is an Update that crashes the Boot sector/system of the installed drive,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems to be the same Problem like</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/394867-after-3-years-sudden-reboot-select-proper-boot-device.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>for data recovery i've used this adapter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.conrad.at/de/digitus-usb-20-zu-ide-sata-adapterkabel-1020905.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can also use similar usb-to-sata products like this:</p>
<p>http://www.delock.de/produkte/G_61510/merkmale.html?setLanguage=en</p>
<p>
</p><p>you should get them for about 30$ also from a local computer store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you connect your failed disc by using this adapter to a usb port of an other computer (my old laptop is sufficient) then your disc pops in the windows explorer up after several seconds. Navigate to the Users foler, there you find all you data and recover
 them to a thumb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reinstalling W7 PRO failes at the moment for mem propably there is something wrong with the latest virus removal signature. Reinstalling W7PRO and updating takes hours for me.</p>
<p>At the moment I refusing all optional updates and try to get windows up again.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can try to move to a newer windows version</p>
<p>

<p>I bought 2 Acer Aspire One computers one from Future shop, one from Best Buy. The one from Future shop has the windows 7 starter version, the one from Best Buy has windows 7. The starter version only allows the screen resolution to be 1024X768 while the
 full version allows 1366X768. Is this a computer issue or a windows 7 starter verus window 7 issue?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Stuck in repair</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to windows 10 and everything was fine until yesterday and windows froze and I downloaded the ISO file for windows 10 and when I restarted my computer and try to boot from the flash drive all that it shows is the windows logo and then
 after about 45 minutes the dots in a circle appears and after about 1 hour I was able to select the keyboard and clicked next and it stayed the same all night then when I got up this morning it was in the diagnosing faze and it remained there for 4 hours and
 then it tried to repair the computer and would not continue,&nbsp; I am at a loss as to what I can do, Can anyone help??

            If &nbsp;your using a VGA cable make sure you don't have any bent pins. &nbsp;Next try a new cable. &nbsp;If the screen still flickers and its a flat screen then try grabbing the screen at both the top corners. &nbsp;Push gently with one hand and pull with the other. &nbsp;All
 you want to do is to slightly put the screen into a small stress. &nbsp;If the flicker gets worse or better then its a bad screen.
<div><br />
<div>I have also seen Bios Versions cause this. &nbsp;You may need to update your Bios.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can visit your manufacturers website and go to the support page and enter your service tag number. &nbsp;You will then find the driver downloads page. &nbsp;In this page you will have a Bios Flash Utility and new version of Bios if available.</div>

            <p><span>Hi Galaxyman4565,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can make your photo to zoom faster by lowering the photo/background duration. Please take note that lowering the duration
 will also shorten your video.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, kindly follow the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Launch Windows Live Movie Maker</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Include all the photos you want</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the<b> Animation</b> tab, select the
<b>effects</b> you want.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then Click<b> Edit</b>, manage the duration of the photo.</span></p>
<p><span>You can do this steps individually to your photos or you can use "apply all" if you want a single effect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Spiderman friend or foe game will not load</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox is brand new (1 week old). I downloaded the newest system update. The game disc is in brand new condition ( no scratches or smudges). When I attempt to start the game through the dashboard, the screen goes black and the system stops responding. I
 have to hard reset the system. I tried the game three times and received the same results each time.</p>

If that does not work, or if you do not have an HDD, please take a few minutes to try these steps below, which will remove and re-apply the most recent update:<br />
<br />
<strong>Delete system update</strong><br />
System Settings &gt; Memory &gt; Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X, Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X &gt; Yes<br />
<br />
<strong>Reinstall Update</strong><br />
When the console restarts, if it is connected to LIVE, it should automatically update.
<br />
<br />
If you have any issue updating this way, or if you do not have an internet connection, you can update via a USB device or burned CD/DVD.

<p>I'm having this same issue as of tonight, 7/25/11. Tried a number of things:</p>
<p>-Tried to play game both from disc AND loaded on HD (250gig S)</p>
<p>-Deleted and reinstalled game on HD 3 separate times</p>
<p>-Tried to load on both my main (live/gold) profile AND an offline profile</p>
<p>-Uninstalled and Reinstalled most recent Live update (using Mister Fitzers guide above)</p>
<p>-Attempted to play from the dashboard, the guide menu, and the games menu</p>
<p>Each time the effect was the same, after hitting "play game" from the dashboard, guide menu, or games menu, the screen would turn black and the console/controller would go completely unresponsive, necessitating a hard shutdown. Only thing I haven't tried
 is removing the HD since I'm not wildly confident about where that is let alone how to do it without messing my console up.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thank you for the info. I tried but it didn't fix the load issue. I did however try a tip found in a similar thread within this same forum, which involved pressing the guide button immediately after hitting "play game" from the dashboard. It still took a
 good two-three minutes of a frozen black screen (with a half loaded guide box) but it eventually would load up. Not a perfect fix but it will at least make the game loadable. Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            Just became a Three-Console household</h2>
                    
<p>We just installed our third One this weekend and we've already seen a lot of issues trying to manage games and accounts, primarily because we've bought all our games digitally as opposed to physically.</p>
<p>I understand that one console is the "Home" console and any game I've bought (as the head family account) is accessible there all the time. &nbsp;That console is primarily used by someone other than me so that they don't have to ever log me in on that console
 to play games. &nbsp;But now, on consoles two and three, I have to log in to start any game even if someone else wants to play it. &nbsp;And then if I want to play a game on the third console while someone else uses console 2, I end up logging myself out on console
 2 which can disrupt their experience and prevent them from changing games without logging me out, disrupting my experience.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to successfully run a three-console house? &nbsp;Do we need to buy additional copies of the most frequently played games and/or do we need to migrate from a one-Xbox-live account family to multiple Xbox live accounts?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>

<p>As you stated, the other accounts can only share your content while they are either using the Home console or while you're signed in. In order to be able to share the content on a third console, you would either need to purchase the content as a physical
 disc, or you can purchase it on a second account and set the 3rd console as that accounts Home console.</p>

<p>That's all correct. Physical discs would not be attached to an account at all. So anyone can play it on any console.</p>

            <p>I got the solution!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to go to your account in windows settings, and change your microsoft account ex "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" to local ex "hallo", and then you have to log out, and log in with your local account ex "hallo".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can delete your mail account in mail and calendar. When you are done.<br />
<br />
Then go back again to your account in windows settings, and change your local account ex "hallo" to your microsoft account ex "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", and then you have to log out, and log in with your microsoft account ex "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now mail account and calendar account works again, it is magic!!!!</p>

            Hi Yunus, there is currently a bug in Windows which I think is causing this on your PC , , , 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer 
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS - check the size of the CBS folder, if that folder is huge, here is the Fix: 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter to open the Services app 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it 
<br />
<br />Set its startup type to Manual 
<br />
<br />Restart your System 
<br />
<br />Then open Windows File Explorer 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS 
<br />
<br />Delete all of the files in the CBS folder 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup       
        </p>

                    <p>Hey there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated to windows 10. Normally, I keep most of my files on my hard drive. I transferred things over as I normally would, and decided to do a a refresh of my computer to optimize how it was running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, &nbsp;overheated while the reset was occuring (around 54% in), and now, it won't start up at all. I cant seem to access the safe mode either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro in a virtual machine now asking for activation after - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro in a virtual machine now asking for activation after several months of legitimate use</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the most recent update of Windows 10 Pro (version 1709 / KB4058043), I now get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to activate Windows on this device because the previous version of Windows was not activated prior to updating to Windows 10.&nbsp; Go to the store to buy original Windows.&nbsp; Error code 0x803F7001.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the case.&nbsp; Windows was activated and I have been using it for several months.&nbsp; Where do I get support to solve this issue?&nbsp; The chat help just tells me to go to the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem here is that this version of Windows 10 I got when Microsoft was giving free Windows 10.&nbsp; So Microsoft never provided a product key for this, and now I am stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike H.</p>

            <p>We are having the same issue. It appears to be related to to mpeg2. We're using mpeg2 in MKV container, windows 10 video player and WMP both crash when trying to open them, as does our in-house software when it tries to load the videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per another user's suggestion renaming C<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">:\Windows\SysWOW64\msmpeg2vdec.dll might work. This allowed us to view the videos, but scrolling
 (we scroll frame by frame) is broken with frames from future parts of the video flashing up</span></p>

            <p>I as well had the same issues with my Windows Media Player 12, I could not view mpg, mpeg, mpe video files, I could see mp4 ok (?).&nbsp; I tried renaming the msmpeg2vdec.dll file as mentioned in one of the above post and while I was able to play mpg, mpeg, mpe
 files, I could no longer see mp4 files. Very frustrating. So I undid the March 15th security update (KB4013429) as suggested in this post and
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all</span></strong> of the movie files now play ok. I have a trouble ticket with Micro Soft and I will explain to them tomorrow - don't know if it will cause them to help anyone or put a fix out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Please Note - my son got the same update on March 14th and my wife received the update on March 16th and they were unaffected - had no issues playing movies. It seems like only people that&nbsp;received the update on March 15th have been affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank You
 All for the blog and posts.</p>

            Micro Soft called me about my case number and said that it was a known issue and that they had another update&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(KB4015438) which would resolve the issue. I had to manually pull the update in to be applied to my computer. Once installed all the videos
 were viewable again. The Micro Soft Answer Desk person said they were still researching the issue - they were unsure why only some people were affected and not others.&nbsp;&nbsp; My case number was closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Micro Soft.

            Same thing happened to me. I uninstalled the update and everything played fine again. 2 days later my computer restarted on its own and the update was reinstalled and now my mpg files will no longer play. Can just this particular update be blocked? Otherwise
 this is going to get monotonous because it doesn't look like any fix is coming!

            OK. KB4015438 just installed before I was able to uninstall KB4013429 for the second time and hurray!!! All is OK. I can play all video files once again. I guess they did come up with a fix after all!

<p>Hey rayquazaEX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like the console needs a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory</a> reset while keeping games and apps, try that and let us know how it goes!</p>

<p>Hi rayquazaEX, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to send out invites instead of just receiving them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which console platform is being used? Xbox One or Xbox 360?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Xbox one is being used, try the following: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/console/reset-factory-defaults-using-usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to reset your Xbox One console to factory defaults using a USB flash drive</a></p>
<p>and choose the option keep my games and apps. Make sure to know the emails and passwords used with the account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this helps :)</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that you may be experiencing network issues from what your saying..
<br />
If your NAT type is open, and you know all of your sign in info for the accounts that you have on your console, then I would recommend you doing what we call a soft reset, keeping your games and apps. Follow the steps here
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults</a> and remember to
<strong>keep my games&nbsp;&amp; apps</strong>, and let us know if that resolved your issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention! Can you confirm that your notifications are turned on?
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/pop-up-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Please review the Pop up notifications Article</a>&nbsp;for more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my experience, Toggling your privacy settings also helps resolve the issue. On your Xbox,
<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/xbox-one-privacy-and-online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change your privacy settings</a> for notifications to "not allow" and then Switch them back to allowed.
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Then power cycle your console</a> and let me know the results!</p>
<p>

<p>Hey rayqyazaEX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If another profile is signed in, does that profile receive notifications just fine? As XBF Chris J has stated, please check out the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/pop-up-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Pop-up notifications on Xbox One</a> for more info and the Xbox One preferences guide for changing notification settings. If the account and/or console was recently enrolled in the preview program these settings may have changed.&nbsp;Let me know if this helps&nbsp;:)</p>
