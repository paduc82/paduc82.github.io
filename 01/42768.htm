<h2>            Stop Windows 10 from reinstalling after rollback</h2>
                    I tried installing Windows 10 on my laptop and although it installed I had massive problems.&nbsp; I rolled back to Windows 8.1 and had a few problems but got it back in good working order.&nbsp; I also cancelled my reservation as instructed.&nbsp; The problem I have
 is that Windows 10 is still sitting&nbsp;in the Control Panel for Windows Update and will not allow anything else to come down without it. How do I get the update off the list?&nbsp;

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the Methods provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>METHOD 1: Using Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)<br />
1. Press "WIN+R" keys together to launch RUN dialog box and type gpedit.msc and press Enter. It'll open Group Policy Editor.<br />
2. Now go to:<br />
Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Store<br />
3. In right-side pane, double-click on "Turn off the offer to update to the latest version of Windows" option and set its value to "Enabled".</p>
<div>That's it. It'll immediately disable the Windows 10 free update notification in Windows 8.1 and you'll never see it again. If you want to enable the notification again in future, set the value to Not configured.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>METHOD 2: Using Registry Editor (regedit)<br />
If you don't want to use Group Policy Editor or can't use it, you can do the same thing using Registry Editor. Just follow these simple steps:<br />
1. Press "WIN+R" keys together to launch RUN dialog box and type regedit and press Enter. It'll open Registry Editor.<br />
2. Now go to following key:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft<br />
3. Create a new key under Microsoft key and set its name as WindowsStore<br />
So the final key path would be:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsStore<br />
4. Select WindowsStore key and in right-side pane, create a new DWORD DisableOSUpgrade and set its value to 1<br />
5. Close Registry Editor and log off or restart Windows to take effect. It'll completely turn off Windows 8.1 update notification.</div>
<div>If you want to restore the notification in future, just delete the DWORD or set its value to 0.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            I tried both of these suggestions, but Windows Update is still not allowing me to perform any updates without trying to install Windows 10. I can no longer apply security updates to my computer unless I am willing to upgrade to Windows 10. How can I continue
 to install security updates&nbsp;without migrating to Windows 10?

<h2>            Windows 7 will not play shutdown sound and plays delayed startup sound.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>So yea... I have just upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 a few days ago and now when my computer turns on, it does not play the startup sound until about 30 seconds after the desktop is shown. (I don't know if this is when it is supposed to play.)
 But my real issue is when I shutdown my computer, the shutdown sound that I selected will not play. I have no clue why, and any sound I select for it will not play at shutdown, although it will play in the preview box.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One idea I have is that it is loading the audio drivers too late and unloading them too quickly because when I first get to my desktop the audio icon has an X through it for like 10-20 seconds, then it goes away. So if anyone knows how &nbsp;fix my issue,
 please help. I appreciate it. :)&nbsp;</strong></p>

            Hi <strong>michael22477</strong> ,<br />
<br />
<strong>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</strong> <br />
<strong><br />
That might be because of incorrect drivers.</strong> <br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Try updating the sound drivers:<br />
To update your Audio driver:&nbsp; <br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then click Control Panel<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click System and Maintenance<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath Device Manager, click View hardware and devices<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Sound, video and game controllers<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click your Audio controller, and click Properties<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Driver tab<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Update Driver button.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Search automatically for updated driver software<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows will now search for an update for your Audio drivers locally and on the internet, then walk you through the process of installing the driver.&nbsp; If it is unable to find a driver you can go to your Sound Card manufacturer‚Äôs website and download any updated
 drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2. </strong>You can contact the sound manufacturer's website to download the latest drivers, if you do not know who is the manufacturer send us the information as mentioned below:
<br />
<strong>To find the manufacturer and model of your Sound Card:</strong> <br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then click Control Panel<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click System and Maintenance<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath Device Manager, click View hardware and devices<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Sound, video and game controllers<br />
Under Sound, video and game controllers you will see the manufacturer and model of your sound card.&nbsp; If you need help finding the driver, please provide this information to us and we can try to find it for you.<br />
For additional help you can refer to the following articles:<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong>Changing sound scheme in Windows 7<br />
Just ensure that you change the sounds using the procedure under the article below:<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-computer-sounds<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.

<h2>            Fingerprint login no longer works</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my HP Envy-15t Laptop to Windows 10 recently and the fingerprint&nbsp;login feature&nbsp;was working just fine for over 3 months.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I&nbsp;tried to add another finger print for my spouse using the sign-in options under Accounts setup. The fingerprint option did not work for her. Then I tried removing all fingerprints and set up my fingerprint&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Now, </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the fingerprint does not work at all. It comes up with 'authentication failed - please try again' message.

<h2>            Black screen and flashing cursor after latest windows update.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hope someone can help me with this. The story so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On restarting PC after windows update on 11.11.16, I had only a series of rotating dots on the screen, left it for around 30 mins, still the same so decided to do a restart. Turns out that was probably a bad move, as all I've got now is a black screen and
 flashing cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not got another PC running windows 7,8 or 10, only one running XP, so following instruction on windows recovery page - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO - and burnt to a DVD.</p>
<p>Set boot menu to boot from dvd drive, but nothing happens. If I put in my original windows 7 disk in it will boot but carnt do a repair, just the possiblity to reinstall windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im reluctant to do that as I dont know if it will cause other issues with updating to windows 10 later.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post.</p>

            <p>Not sure why the reply has been marked as an answer, as I couldn't get past the black screen, and all recovery options failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual way I sort of solved it was to reinstall windows7 from my original disk, then update again to win 10 using the media creation tool, re-download all and reinstall all my software, back everything up to an external drive ( which wasn't happening
 before) although I had the PC set to automatically backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took about 3 days in all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading on forums suggest it may be a conflict with windows update and Logitech setpoint software.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h3> l.lee88  say:</h3>
<h2>            microphone level</h2>
                    hello, <br />
<br />
i have windows vista. when i use programs such as skype, during a call i am able to hear fine, but the person on the other line cannot hear me. initially, the volume tends to fade, and then they end up not hearing me at all. (the problem persists whether i
 use the built mic or headset). When i adjust the microphone volume, the level decreases (and goes to 0) on its own and there is no way of stabilizing it. help!!<br />
thanks!

<p><span><span>Verify in the recording tab if the Microphone is enabled and working. Click configure and once you see the driver
 working (i.e., responds to your voice), right-click on it and set that as the default.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>:
<strong>Using Windows Sound Recorder to test the microphone.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can use this section to find out if the Notebook can record a signal from the</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Microphone and play it back. Use Windows sound recorder to create an audio file using the following steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1. Plug the
<strong>microphone</strong> into the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, All Programs, Accessories, and select Sound Recorder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click Start Recording (the red circle) and speak into the microphone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;When finished recording, click Stop Recording.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>&nbsp;A save screen automatically opens.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Type a filename and click Save. A file of type WAV or WMA is created in the Documents folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If you can record the Audio using Microphone using the above method then the Microphone is working fine. Now it should work
 with any application that Supports Microphone. If the Notebook does not record audio using the above method then it could be an issue with the settings of the Microphone. Now verify the following settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 3</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:
<strong>Enabling the Microphone.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1. Plug the microphone into the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, All Programs, Accessories, and select Sound Recorder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click Start Recording (the red circle) and speak into the microphone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Recording tab showing a detected signal for the Microphone device</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><em><span> Microphone
 Icon should have <span>Green check mark </span>on it(As shown in the above figure). If there is no
<span>Green check mark</span>, it means it is disabled. If there is No green mark on Microphone<span>
</span>it never works. To enable the Microphone Right click on Microphone and click on Enable. If you do not see the Microphone in the list, Right click on the White space and select Show disabled<span>
</span>devices. Then you would see the Microphone. However, if you do not see the green check mark<span>
</span>on it, Right click on it and click on Enable. And also Select Microphone and click on Set<span>
</span>Default(If Set as default button is active).</span></em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>If you see the
<span>Green check mark </span>on Microphone the Microphone definitely works.</span></span></span></em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><br />
Step 4: Increasing Microphone Sensitivity and Un-muting the Microphone.</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1. Select
<strong>Microphone</strong> and click on <strong>Properties</strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Microphone Properties: Levels tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Adjust the
<strong>slider</strong> until to 100 % of its range.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. If Mute is on, click the mute button to un-mute the device. The mute button should show as<span>
</span>a blue speaker without any red circle.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. If
<strong>Microphone</strong> <strong>Boost</strong> is available, adjust to +20.0 dB.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click
<strong>OK</strong> to make the changes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now the Microphone should work. To verify this open the Sound recorder and perform the<span>
</span>steps provided in Step 1. If the issue persists then it could be a hardware issue with the<span>
</span>Microphone or Microphone drivers. Perform the below steps to resolve the Driver related<span>
</span>issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Step 5: Update the audio drivers</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1. Connect to the
<strong>Internet</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, and enter device manager in the Start search field.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A
<strong>Device Manager</strong> window opens.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click the plus sign (+), next to Sound, video and game controllers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Right-click the name of the sound hardware and select Update Driver Software....</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click Search automatically for updated driver software and wait for Windows to update<span>
</span>the driver software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Windows checks a remote Web site to see if updated driver software is available.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>¬∑</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If an update is available, let Windows install the update.<span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>¬∑</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If an update is not available, skip to the next step.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>7. Once the update is installed successfully, test the
 microphone or line-in as was done in step 1. If the problem persists, go to the next step.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In case it is only with Skype then you have to set it if it is not automatically detected. You can try the following steps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Go to Skype main window,
<strong><span>and select Preferences</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In this setup, select the microphone input from the dropdown. And select your microphone. Also select speaker settings.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>After selecting the proper input and output, check if it works.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
Hope this information was helpful.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All the best!</span></span></p>

<h2>            Bluetooth speaker pairs but does not connect and play audio.</h2>
                    <p>I have an HMDX Rave speaker, it pairs to my Lenovo T530 laptop running Windows 8.1 Pro through the PC Settings menu.&nbsp; I go to play audio through it and the audio playback device manager sound menu shows it as not connected.&nbsp; I right click &gt; enable on it
 and nothing happens.&nbsp; I go to the bluetooth icon in the task-tray and tried adding device through settings with enabled bluetooth and joining personal area network.&nbsp; The device pairs through the setting menu and then shows connected for several seconds, then
 disconnects.&nbsp; The personal network menu recognizes the speaker, installs the driver for it, but then nothing works.&nbsp;&nbsp; Restarting even after connecting to bluetooth or through the personal network menu has no effect.&nbsp; I have tried everything I can think of,
 what am I missing?<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t boot or repair. What do I do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> confused user_99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t boot or repair. What do I do&#63;</h2>
                    I had a working windows 7 installation on a 1tb disk with approximately 100gb unpartitioned near the end. I decided to install fedora 18 in the free space.
<br />
<br />
After the install, my machine will no longer load a boot manager of any kind (windows or grub2), so I can't get to recovery options that way. I have a repair disk, which I inserted and booted to and got the message "non-system disk or bad media. please insert
 disk and press any key" I'm pretty sure it's not a bad disk because I made another with the same result.<br />
<br />
I do not have an original installation CD; Win7 came preinstalled.<br />
<br />
I made a system image onto an external usb hard drive before I installed fedora, but it is not self-bootable (no boot loader installed), so I don't have a way of accessing it to reinstall back to my main hard drive.<br />
<br />
At this point I'm not worried about getting Fedora to work, I just want a working operating system back.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you'll need more info than this to solve my problem. I don't have much time right now and need to reboot every time I want to look at error messages; If you reply with a list of information you need, I will get back to you.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much,<br />

            <p>Hi,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you choosing Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the issue description, you are unable to boot to the computer and also not able to restore the image backup.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to these questions, to understand the issue better and help you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you create a backup using backup and restore on Windows 7?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have used Windows 7 ‚Äúbackup and restore‚Äù to create a system image of the backup please refer the following article that tells you how to restore the image.</p>

            1. I did create the backup using "backup and restore." However, none of the methods in that article work for me.<br />
<ul>
<li>I can't use the recovery control panel because I can't boot.</li><li>I can't use the built-in system repair because I can't get to any type of boot options. Any attempt to boot to the hard disk ends with "Error: No boot disk has been detected or the disk has failed (though I know the disk has not failed because I can still
 access the files when I am using a live CD. It's also under 8 months old and passes all the BIOS diagnostics, so that is unlikely, I think).</li><li>I can't use the repair disk because when I boot to it, I get a "non-system disk or bad media. please insert disk and press any key" message and it does not boot.</li></ul>
<p>2. My computer is an HP Pavilion desktop PC, model number 7-1270t, product number A5T37AV#ABA.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            I am close to finding a solution. I finally was able to reset the MFT on my hard disk, download a blank windows 7 installation disk, and install windows. However, it:<br />
1) Had almost no driver support (bad resolutions, no internet, etc.) and<br />
2) Could not see my old system image.<br />
<br />
I booted to the installation disk again, and tried the "restore from a system image" option. This time it saw the image but gave the following error message:<br />
<br />
"The System Restore failed.<br />
<br />
Windows cannot restore a system image to a computer that has different firmware. The system image was created on a computer using EFI and this computer is using BIOS."<br />
<br />
At one point, I reset my bios to the default settings. I image that this is the cause of the error. How can I switch back to EFI?<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />

Thanks for the reply; Though I couldn't use it this time, perhaps it'll help someone else. I got my system working, and I'll be making HP recovery disks right away.<br />
<br />
Solved! What ended up working:<br />
<ol>
<li>Booted to Fedora live CD, made the Partition Table GPT using Gparted. Left everything blank.<br />
</li><li>Booted to Win7 DVD (make sure it's the UEFI option, not the Legacy option) and perform a clean install on the computer.</li><li>Ethernet didn't work, but I had a USB wifi card which did work. Updated the drivers, then Ethernet worked.</li><li>Installed all windows updates.</li><li>Booted to Win7 DVD (again, UEFI option), chose 'system restore-&gt;restore system image'</li><li>Success!<br />

<h2>            Save Data not accessible in-game after it was copied to a flashkey </h2>
                    
<p>My husband copied my gamer profile and data to a flashkey while he was logged in under his profile. Now, no matter what I do, I can't access any of my data in-game. It looks like I've never played the game before when I put it in. I've copied everything
 back, changed storage devices etc. and no dice. The data isn't corrupted so I'm really not sure what to do. There's YEARS of game play potentially lost here. Can anyone help?&nbsp;</p>

<p>onyxishere: &nbsp;i have never seen a usb drive get "changed" by connecting it to a pc, but i have seen that with internal hard dives. &nbsp;when you connect a usb drive formatted for xbox 360 storage to a pc and open the folder you will see a folder called Xbox360,
 and inside is all the data from the 360 filesystem stored as chunks labelled Data0000, Data0001, etc. &nbsp;i back up those files all the time in case my flash drive dies, or i need to use it for something else. &nbsp;i have successfully "restored the backup" simply
 by copying the files back as they were, without again formatting the usb drive with the 360. &nbsp;also she said she was able to copy the files back to the console, but i have another guess as to what may have happened.</p>
<p>Herbwitch: &nbsp;what malacath and onyxishere have said are both sort of correct. &nbsp;when you copy data logged in as another profile, as you said he did, there will be a message stating "By copying or moving this item, you will become the new owner." &nbsp;however in
 most cases it will not allow you to perform the copy, giving a message that "This item cannot be transferred between profiles."</p>
<p>if you just go into the storage menu and choose an item to copy it will either copy (if it's an item not assigned to any profile, like a global system save), or it will not allow you to copy at all. &nbsp;however, if you choose the device and press Y for Device
 Options, then choose Transfer Content, you can do a mass transfer, selecting as many or few items you want at once. &nbsp;it will allow you to transfer anything without attempting to reassign the ownership because it will sign the current profile out before performing
 the transfer.</p>
<p>either way the best way to be sure is to go into storage and check for the save file of the specific game you are trying to play. &nbsp;it should show the game's name, then when you select it, the items for that game will be listed. &nbsp;your saves should be listed
 with the subtitle Saved Game on the left and your gamertag on the right.</p>
<p>what is the reason he copied your data from the main storage device? &nbsp;did he have to format it? &nbsp;some more info would be needed to be sure what happened, but perhaps he tried to copy all your data, ignored the messages about some data not being able to transfer,
 and then formatted, leaving you only with global system saves. &nbsp;again i would check the specific games that you lost progress on, and post back letting us know what you find.</p>

            I would suggest you to check the status of volume shadow service. If it is not running please start it and set it to automatic. If it does not start please check the dependency services and make they all are started when you click on volume shadow service you see a dependency tab. Make sure the services under the dependency tab are up and running.
<br />
<br />Services related to System Restore are:
<br />
<br />-      Volume shadow copy
<br />
<br />-      Multimedia Class Scheduler
<br />
<br />-      Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
<br />
<br />-      DCOM Server Process Launcher

<br />If the issue persists, try this method.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Performing a System File Checker Scan(SFC) on your computer.

<p>Thanks Andre for your reply, I have checked the status of volume shaddow servive, and the dependency services, and found all were running, and set to automatic. I then as advised performed a SFC, and all completed successfully. As advised I also ran sfc/scannow
 on my system, and this also completed successfully, reporting "did not find any integrity violations".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my system, opened System Restore to set a restore point, but got the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any further ideas on how to correct this error?</p>

            Which Antivirus utility do you have installed? Try disabling it temporarily?
<br />Di you ave external storage devices attached such as mechanical external stroage, USB thumb drive? If so, disconnect them.
<br />
<br />Try again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, reboot into Safe Mode then attempt System Restore again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Click Boot tab
<br />Check Safe Boot
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />Restart prompted
<br />Attempt System Restore
<br />
<br />You can also try system restore in the recovery environment:
<br />
<br />	Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off

<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot

<h2>            Crackdown 3&#58; Xbox One X reverts to Stereo with Dolby Atmos setup</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have had to stop playing Crackdown 3 until this is fixed.</p>
<p>When I connect Dolby Atmos compatible AV set to Xbox One X, it reverts to Stereo. It works flawlessly with Gears of War 4 and other games, as well as Netflix app. But when I play Crackdown 3 Dolby Atmos does not work as it should (it is one of the games
 prepared for this).</p>
<p>Any idea or solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>yes, console restart, a different Xbox One X and instead of Marantz, an Onkyo of the latest AV system.</p>
<p>It does not activate Dolby Atmos in any way, but other games do it flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like a bug, yes, but for everybody. Not only for a determinated setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has tested Dolby Atmos setup with Crackdown 3? What setup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Restore Points are created automatically by Windows. To make use of them, follow the process I posted previously.<br />
<br />
I note that you installed registry boosters on your machine. This is bad news. Not only are they totally useless, they can cause serious damage to your installation. It remains to be seen if you can salvage yours or of you have to perform a Factory Restore.<br />

    <title>Gears of War 2 freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msuzeppfan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gears of War 2 freezing</h2>
                    
<p>It seems to be a problem with my gamertag/profile only. I've tried running the game on Xbox One and 360, and the game freezes when it gets to the title screen and says "Updating Network settings." I've tried via disk and game download. The game works fine
 on the Xbox One with my wife's gamertag/profile, but if I try to sign in, it freezes.</p>
<p>I've deleted my gamertag from both consoles and reinstalled it; I've deleted the game from both consoles and reinstalled it. I've tried deleting all my Xbox 360 saved games and files from Xbox One settings screen. No luck at all. Also, when I navigate to
 cloud storage management on the Xbox 360, Gears of War 2 doesn't appear as a saved game. I went ahead and deleted all cloud storage saves to see if that would work. Still no luck.</p>
<p>It was working fine Friday night, but wouldn't work Saturday or today.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Do you have any DLC for the game? &nbsp;Sometimes if you own DLC and delete it and then try to play the game X years later let's say on XB1 after loading up a cloud save game, you're save will look for DLC not present. &nbsp;This should return an error saying dlc
 not found and is needed for this save file, but sometimes can corrupt the save (which may auto create a saved settings file each time you load up the game ).. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'd recommend trying to disconnect from the internet when attempting to load the game (for the first time after install) as it might be trying to pull up data that is not really there and doesn't know how to handle it. &nbsp;Other than that, I see you deleted
 everything but the original HDD saves on 360, which could be causing the error on that console but not on XB1, if you have deleted 100% of each save. &nbsp;You might also want to check any special promotion DLC like skins or characters that might be causing an
 issue ie delete all from GoW2 &nbsp;including MP characters/progress. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey, MSUZeppfan! Since it works on your wife's account, it sounds like your game save might be corrupted. Have you tried moving the save you have on the 360 to somewhere that you cannot access (like temporarily moving it to a flash drive) and then launching up a brand new game? Does that work for you?</p>

<p>Misses Quinzel,</p>
<p>That doesn't work .. the only thing that works is "resetting" my profile by logging out before starting the game, starting a training session without signing in, then quickly signing in as the training session loads. One of the guys on Xbox Support on Twitter
 sent me to a GoW forum that laid out that method. Of course, it erases my saves, collectibles, etc. Every time I try to start up a saved game on my Xbox One, it appears that my profile is corrupted, so I switched over to the 360 and disconnected from the internet.</p>
<p>My wife and I have been successfully playing co-op on our 360 offline a couple of days, and it was working fine (after "resetting" my profile) until we hit a random checkpoint last night, and the game locked up, and her profile got corrupted. Luckily, we
 were able to "reset" her profile without it erasing the save under my profile. I just hope it doesn't happen to my profile again before we finish the campaign playthrough. It's a pain in the backside to have to start the campaign over time and time again.</p>

<p>Man, this happened to me recently. &nbsp;I have been looking for a fix, that thread linked by Mister Beep seems to say it isn't permanent, or can break again?</p>
<p>If i know it won't break again, as long as i never play coop, i'm so down for that fix... But seems crazy this game has such a game breaking bug in it.</p>
<p>I've submitted report through xbox itself, hopefully it helps. &nbsp;I want to so badly just blaze through this series before GoW4, but i don't want to hit 3 before 2. &nbsp;So frustrating :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have problems downgrading from Windows 10 to 8.1.</p>
<p>1. downgrade appeared to work, then on boot: Windows 8.1 login screen, same code, works: nothing but black screen.</p>
<p>2. mouse cursor appears to be there too, so I used Ctrl+Alt+Del to try and figure out what's going on.</p>
<p>3. that worked. opened task manager.</p>
<p>4. noticed explorer was missing, tried to run explorer through Run console - no response, iexplore works (that's how I am writing this question), and so do various other things such as Control Panel and file explorer.</p>
<p>5. tried to install windows 10 again off this installer from a link from a forum, called media something? it didn't work, got stuck halfway through. I hard-shut my laptop. booted again.</p>
<p>6. tried to use admin privileges and saw they were missing from my user. couldn't activate them in any way. not through cmd.</p>
<p>7. tried to boot in safe mode - failed, no matter how quick and how much I press or press and hold F8, it goes straight to windows login screen.</p>
<p>8. can't completely wipe the hard drive as I need the copy of windows 8 on it to keep using it. I have no backup for this copy.</p>
<p>9. really don't like windows 10, made my computer extremely slow and unreliable. need to either somehow install a clean explorer, or just install Windows 8 and then upgrade it to 8.1 cleanly, I don't mind deleting user files, they are all backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>solutions to clean my laptop and start fresh with windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>currently downloading through windows update windows 10 hoping installing it will bring me back explorer.</p>
<p>so worst case scenario I don't mind starting fresh with a clean install of windows 10. but I need a version of windows that works with my apps, Chrome and OneNote on windows 10 are extremely hard on my 2 year old Samsung.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>xbox one s-Every game I play on multiplayer loses connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seventygoose291  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox one s-Every game I play on multiplayer loses connection host&#47;server. why&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have had my xbox one s since november 2017. Every game I play online loses connection to host/server after about 5 to 10 minutes of playing. I also have a xbox 360 that has no such problems when I play online. So I am assuming there is something wrong
 with my xbox one s settings?

<p>Hi SeventyGoose291, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about any issues you may be having with losing network connection while playing multiplayer games. I would recommend to<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> test
 the network connection </a>and run a Detail Network Statisticsto see how much signal the Xbox is receiving. How are you connecting to the network (ethernet/wireless)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know.</p>
<p>
