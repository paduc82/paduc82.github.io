    <title>Surface Pro 4 Does not Recognize Micro SD Card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Does not Recognize Micro SD Card</h2>
                    I have been having this problem where the SD card is not recognized in my Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; I've tried the card in my Surface 3 and a Dell laptop and it works just fine.&nbsp; Sometimes the card drive shows on "This PC" and I can access files, but it eventually
 just goes away.&nbsp; This is very noticeable when I play a video stored on the SD card. I've tried many things to fix, to no avail.&nbsp; I'm hoping the card slot is not defective since the SP 4 is out of warranty.

<p>Barb, I've tried different cards with the same result. I've also gone into the UEFI and turned the SD card slot off and rebooted, then I turn it back on and reboot again. The card and slot will work for a while, but after a short time it will not show in&nbsp;<br />
"My PC". The cards work fine on other computers. I think this is some kind of driver issue and not a hardware issue base on my UEFI test.&nbsp; I've also made sure all USB drivers are up to date. Maybe it's time for a new Surface, but I'm waiting for Surface Pro
 7. Note, I'm an Insider on build 18865, but this problem has been going on long before this build.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bill</p>

            <div>&gt; Note, I'm an Insider on build 18865, but this problem has been going on long before this build. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>do you mean on other Insider builds prior to 18865? Did you have this issue on</div>
<div>1809? you should file a complete problem report using the Feedback Hub and also</div>
<div>post this in the Insider Forum. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The only way to rule out software/drivers for certain is to use a downloadable</div>
<div>recovery image and go back to a production build and update to 1809.</div>
<div>Instructions below. Let us know if you have this issue after reimaging. If yes,</div>
<div>then it would point to a hardware issue and you would need an exchange.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>(with a different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; </div>
<div>and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick</div>
<div>formatted FAT32 (use a Windows computer). Use FULL format and not quick format.</div>
<div>Give the volume a name like surfboot.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>
<div>button for 30 seconds).</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the</div>
<div>screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Just remove my files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues</div>
<div>(this can take a while).</div>

            Barb, I've tried other cards and experienced the same problem.&nbsp; I'm on Skip Ahead Build 18865.1000, Version 1903.&nbsp; Note I had the same issue with 1803. I could back up and go back to production build, but that seems extreme.&nbsp; I'll post to Feedback on this
 issue.

<p>Ok, I can try this, but it will have to wait till the weekend.&nbsp; I can tell you I did have the issue with 1809, but I finally just got so annoyed with this issue I posted it to the community. This is after I did a lot of research on the internet and tried
 different Micro SD cards. Thank you for your help.</p>

            Windows did a big upgrade 2 days ago now my sd card on surface pro 4 does not work get the following error in Device Manager under USB it shows as an unknown USB device failed to restart then after a while it says compliance mode. Turned off and on the
 slot in bios. I know the unknown USB device is the sd card slot because when I deactivate in bios it goes away. Also, the error reads with or without the card in the slot. It's not the card either tried others. This is a big issue for me, can Microsoft get
 this fixed asap, please

<p>I got that upgrade on Thursday for a bunch of driver updates.&nbsp; I'm on Skip Ahead build 18865, and the problem with SD Card was not fixed with the updates.&nbsp; I spent most of today re-imaging my Surface Pro 4 to the 1803 build (1809 was not available for download),
 per Barbara Bowman's instructions.&nbsp; So far the SD Card is working, but I have not given it a lot of testing.&nbsp; Even on build 18865 the SD card worked sometimes. I'll see what happens Sunday when I can test it more. I'm hoping this is just bad drivers and the
 problem can be fixed with an update.&nbsp; I made an image of my drive with build 18865 and most likely with go back to it in a few days.&nbsp; I just don't want to reload all my programs and apps.&nbsp; I will also post this problem through the Feedback Hub. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, what build are you on and did you try going back to an earlier build?</p>

<p>Barb,</p>
<p>I re-imaged my Surface Pro 4 first to the 1703 release and then to the 1803 release through windows update.&nbsp; I've tested the SD Card opening videos and pictures I have stored on it and it has not failed, yet.&nbsp; At this point, it looks like a software issue
 causing the problem I had on the 19H1 and 20H1 builds. Note I was not able to download the 1809 release and test that.&nbsp; However, I'm sure I had the SD Card issue through my testing on the Fast Ring.&nbsp; I did go to the Feedback Hub and found that many Surface
 owners are experiencing problems with the SD card.&nbsp; I did not see a reply from Microsoft regarding this issue.&nbsp; It looks like It's the USB Mass Storage Device driver that could be causing the problem.&nbsp; In regards to the "Big Update" a couple of days ago, the
 Michael alluded to, it was a driver and UEFI update for Surface 4.&nbsp; I've attached a screenshot of what was updated.&nbsp; I'm glad it's not a hardware/mechanical issue, however, I hope Microsoft can figure this out for us Surface owners.&nbsp; I may reload the image
 for my 20H1 build and hope the driver issued is fixed soon.&nbsp; Thanks for your help. Bill</p>

<h2>            turned off computer in mid update</h2>
                    This is help for a family member who is not tech savvy. Two days ago when she turned off her computer it started to do an update. This took a long time and so she chose to force shut down the machine, leaving it off. She returned it to yesterday and it
 instantly said re-configuring windows and turned it off again. She then told me about it, and I told her to turn it on and leave it for as long as possible. She thought 6 hours would be enough so had turned it off again. I told her off and told her to turn
 it on and leave it over night. It has still not re-configured. Is there anything that I can instruct her to do (would resetting the machine work? if so are there instructions on how to do this as soon as i turn it on) or is it leave it on for over a day or
 two and hope for the best?

                    Since upgrading to windows 10 from 8.1, my dvd is not opening on my Dell computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no upgrades to the drivers at this time.&nbsp; Dell wanted to charge me over $200 to email me the new driver from technical support.&nbsp; My computer isn't even 2 years
 old now, so no way am I going spend that money.&nbsp; Everything else works perfect on my computer since the upgrade!

<h2>            Amazon assistant - can&#39;t remove</h2>
                    <p>I can't uninstall Amazon assistant from Windows 10 via control panel &nbsp;and it is causing problems every time I start up my laptop. &nbsp;It seems to be trying to do something in the background. &nbsp;When I click on uninstall it only shows 'change' and then comes up
 with install wizard. &nbsp;When I try and remove it says I can't because I'm not the administrator (which I am!)</p>

We have had the same problem on my wife's computer, I have run several different malware programs and have not found any but cannot remove the program. We tried the solutions you just listed and still no luck.

<p>
</p><p>There should be an available Uninstall Wizard that you can get by contacting the developer which you can us to manually uninstall the said program.</p>
<p>

            Amazon told me to "uninstall it" using the program removal process, but t<span>he entire problem is that it&nbsp;could&nbsp;NOT be uninstalled--it was grayed out.&nbsp; The individual files could not be deleted, either, even with administrative
 permission.&nbsp; The solution was to individually drag them from the Amazon Assistant folder to the desktop, sign out and restart the computer, and then drag each file from the desktop to the recycle bin.&nbsp; It might not have been necessary to restart again, but
 I did to be sure it was really gone. &nbsp;</span>

<p>I had the same problem. Here's how I got around it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a search on your computer for "AmazonAssistant-US.msi". Mine was located in C:\Windows\Temp. This is the original installer for the Amazon Assistant . Double click on the&nbsp;"AmazonAssistant-US.msi" file and it will give you the option to remove. Job done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course if you or the person who installed the Amazon Assistant originally have been super efficient and deleted the installer file, you'll have to track down another copy.</p>

<p>A variation of your procedure worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Windows&gt;Settings&gt;Apps as if I were trying a conventional uninstall. This showed the version number (10.17.0926 in my case)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used regedit to search for the version number. This revealed the installer to be C:Windows\Installer\5d3882c3.msi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I used File Explorer to search for 5d3882c3 and double-clicked the result.</p>

<p>It was actually a lot easier than any of the suggested posts here.</p>
<p>I figure what we want to do is re-run the install program, so</p>
<p>I simply googled "Download Amazon Assistant" and it took me to Amazon's download page.</p>
<p>Click on Download and let the installer run.&nbsp; When it does, it'll detect you already have Amazon Assistant installed and it'll ask you to Change or Remove.&nbsp; Click Remove and also Ignore when it warns you that the program is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update downloaded but computer shut off before it finished installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I left my computer overnight to update the OS, woke up in the morning and it was just about done. After it downloaded everything it said "installing packages", then gave me an "installed" message. I turned off my PC and left for a while, then when I turned
 it back on I wanted to check if the update was installed. Apparently it wasn't, and now has to re-download everything, 10 hours of it. Is there any way to see if the downloaded files can just be reinstalled or were they deleted when I shut down my computer?<br />
<br />
Thank you,</p>
<p>Ashraf</p>

<p>Hello Ashraf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can check if the update was installed or not, by going to the update history. Unfortunately, you will need to re-download the updates if it did not go through.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other option is to download the update manually in our <strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a></strong> website, so that you will have the actual update file (In
 case the update will not go through and you will need to reinstall the update again.) You just need to copy the KB number of the update that failed, search for it in the Microsoft Update Catalog website, download the appropriate version for your system, run,
 and install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Random lag spikes while streaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> endonova  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random lag spikes while streaming</h2>
                    
<p>My setup:&nbsp; Xbox using wired connection, laptop using wireless AC.&nbsp; Router is an Archer C9 with latest firmware.&nbsp; Everything works FLAWLESSLY 90 percent of the time, but once in a while, every 3 to 5 minutes, there is a HUGE lag spike and the stream gets
 garbled and input is ignored for about 5 seconds, then goes back to normal.&nbsp; When its working, its perfect.&nbsp; Super fast and responsive.&nbsp; Been playing Destiny from my laptop and there is NO lag at all most of the time, not even a second of input lag.&nbsp; But that
 little spike once in a while really is annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this or have any ideas?&nbsp; I can't imagine something on my laptop suddenly using a whole bunch of bandwidth every few minutes.&nbsp; Also, my girlfriend plays the regular way (xbox on her tv) and never has any issues, nor have I when I used
 to be hooked up to a tv as well.&nbsp; Also, never noticed any lag spikes playing any other games that occurred at regular intervals.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>So I think I fixed my issue. &nbsp;All I had to do was update my wifi drivers. &nbsp;I kept checking windows update for new drivers, since with windows 10, Microsoft was supposed to handle all those updates, but I guess Microsoft is a little behind :P. &nbsp;Intel website
 had a much newer one, so I installed those, and so far this morning have had NO issues. &nbsp;Played 2 strikes in destiny and not one lag spike. &nbsp;I definitely would have had a few per strike before the driver update. &nbsp;</p>

<div>First, I tried deleting the account from the Control Panel. &nbsp;The "Delete Account" Button didn't show up.

</div>
<div>I thought It was a virus, so I scanned my computer with many kinds of antivirus software. &nbsp;It didn't remove the "Administrator" account.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then, I took my computer to a Computer store and told them the problem. &nbsp;They say that they have No Idea what's going on, although they say it might be a virus.</div>

<br />
There is some logic rule (which I cannot remember) that determines whether the Administrator account is visible or not. You can force the issue by typing this command at an
<br />
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList"&nbsp; /v&nbsp; Administrator&nbsp; /t&nbsp; reg_sz&nbsp; /d 0<br />
<br />
Remember to create, test and document a second admin account <span style="font-weight: bold">
before</span> typing the above command.<br />

<h2>            CHKDSK stops when running Stage 5 of Chkdsk &#40;Checking free clusters&#41;</h2>
                    I am preparing to upgrade Vista to Win 7. I have a HP IQ506 computer. I have upgrade the BIOS. When I attempted to Backup my files, I kept getting a failure and error code 0x80070445d. The fix was to run CHKDSK on all drive. When I attempted this, the
 computer successfully completes Stages 1 thru 4. When running Stage 5 (checking free clusters),&nbsp;the computer locks up.&nbsp; I attempted to use the HP Recovery disks and received the same results when running CHKDSK.&nbsp; I performed a system check available in the
 system recovery.&nbsp; It uses PC Doctor to perform these tests.&nbsp; I receive an error on the hard drive: Boot path, error code BIOHD-4, Error: Unutilized/corrupt boot structure detected.<br />
<br />
Any ideas of how to proceed?

<p>Hey Edith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like the others have said, all save data is backed up to Microsoft's servers aka "the Cloud". Note, however, that there are two types of factory resets: a soft reset which resets the console but keeps all games and applications or a complete reset which
 resets the console and removes everything. If you do a complete reset, you would have to re-install your games but save data will return when the specific game is installed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype</h2>
                    <p>My laptop just performed an update for Windows 10. Skype was also updated at that time. I am not sure which may have caused this, but skype will no longer send or receive calls on this device. The calls came in on my phone when he called me on skype and
 not my laptop which I've used the past few years to skype. When I tried to call him on skype with my laptop, it just kept saying "connecting," then hung up. He was on the regular phone with me when I was attempting to call him on skype and never heard a ring
 on his end while my skype was supposedly connecting to him. Again, he called me and the laptop skype never registered it.</p>
<p>It worked perfectly for years right up until one or both of these updates. I'd like to know how to get it working again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 User Account permissions and priviledges</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 PRO: I have admin account and another account, both are local account. How can I manage the permissions and priviledges of the non admin account? UAC is not the answer, I need to manage things like denying installation of programs, creating new
 users etc etc. Windows 10 is a disaster, you just had to go the apple way and assume all your users are mindless zombies and idoits, and whats the point of keeping old control panel and items there when some of them are a mere shadow of their former shelves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, serious question, all I've found so far have pointed me to UAC, which has never been an answer as its the first thing I always disable. UAC was the start of assuming users are idiots which is pretty insulting, and things have gone worse with each
 windows after 7.&nbsp;</p>

            Like I said before UAC isn't answer. Even when UAC is set to full, local non adminstrator users can still access all computer settings and modify everything. They can also modify program settings at will. UAC only stop users from installing new programs.

    <title>How to surf anonymously - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to surf anonymously</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I want to be able to surf the web and logon to websites to which I'm registered BUT not show my real TCP/IP address (the one assigned by my&nbsp;ISP) or related information (like the DNS servers or DHCP server, etc...)&nbsp;or any other information about my home network
 or the computer I am using.&nbsp; I'm having a problem with one when I do so from my home or any other PC in my home I start getting all sorts of ads and then a wave of e-mails.&nbsp; This does not occur if I logon to the site from another location (any other location)
 - so I'm sure they're identifying me through my location.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot simply stop using the site as it is critical to me.</p>
<p>I've heard this is possible (at least masking the TCP/IP address) using a proxy, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to set this up, what software is required, how to find a proxy server to use to do this, and so forth.&nbsp; If possible, I'd like to use
 freeware and free access, but will consider inexpensive options if that's the only choice.&nbsp; Can someone please explain how this is done (or refer me to links that do so and provide recommendations or links for software or proxy server sites that will accomplish
 my goals)?&nbsp; I've heard that using Privoxy and TOR together will do the job - but that looks very complicated and I'm concerned it will affect my internet and even local network usage in ways I don't want happening (but it was the best combined solution I could
 find myself and I'd like to know if it is safe and what are the ramifications of installing and using these products).</p>
<p>I've cleared my internet browser information including cookies, but that hasn't worked - so either they've installed some other way to identify me, my computer provides information that identifies me (like my local network ID or the MAC address or something
 like that), do so during registration or logon,&nbsp;or it's simply a matter of TCP/IP address.&nbsp; Though it is dynamically assigned by the ISP, the lease period is long enough that disconnecting and reconnecting doesn't work.&nbsp; I've tried IP release and IP renew
 and received one slightly different, but the same problem still occurs (perhaps because it's close even if not identical or perhaps because of cookies they installed).&nbsp; I cannot logon or re-register without cookies enabled.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help, suggestions, recommedations, or links you can provide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you, Jack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though it did not answer my question (and I see why you wouldn't want to tackle it as I suggested combining several specifially-identified products together and thus would expect no specific support from either company and it is perhaps a bit too complicated
 for this forum and belongs in Technet which I will try next), it was helpful due to the links so I marked it as such.&nbsp; Searching is how I found these products.&nbsp; i was merely trying to verify that they would work as indicated - but I suspect you're having the
 same trouble with the information on their websites that I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate your time and assistance.</p>

            Hi Kosh, <br />
Your problem is that they are picking up your IP address, that's why it doesn't happen when you'r away from home.
<br />
<br />
You can use <span style="font-weight: bold">startpage.com</span> (or the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Firefox addon for Startpage SSL)</span> and what's even better is <span style="font-weight: bold">
Startingpage.com</span> (this one you need to <span style="font-weight: bold">go to the website</span> and click on the "<span style="font-weight: bold">Add to Firefox</span>" link).
<br />
Startingpage allows you to <span style="font-weight: bold">click on the Proxy link below each result</span>.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps! <br />
<br />
Gladly,<br />
Jerseygrrl<br />

<p>Tutti i prodotti (giochi, add on, dlc, temi) che hai scaricato dal Marketplace sono tuoi e potrai riscaricarli tutte le volte che vorrai.</p>
<p>Quindi è perfettamente inutile backuparli.</p>

<p>Lo hanno solo chiuso per i giochi della xbox originale, parliamo di materiale che ha grossomodo 7 anni e per cui non avrebbe davvero senso continuare a mantenere la retrocompatibilità.</p>

            Looks like you are out of lick with Microsoft.<br />
<br />
There are 3rd&nbsp;Party photo/slideshow&nbsp;screensaver downloads&nbsp;that claim to do this and that, but most of them are virus ridden and/or useless<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here is a reply to a post about it:<br />

<div>Don't know. The settings for the screensaver are found under this key:<br />
<br />
"HKEY_CURRENT_<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>USER</span></a>\Software\Microsoft\Windows

but the values for 'Speed' seem to be 0, 1, or 2 (slow, medium, fast),<br />
they're not in seconds <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vistax64.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fsad.gif" /><br />

<p>Most of the gamers I seen have weird stats that don't match their skill. They do good in one match then do very badly in the following. So no I haven't met one that could do the same in every game. No matter what level we play on.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn't mean you should be saying a game 'takes no skill to be good at' when it's a completely incorrect and unfounded statement that people just sling around because every second fool does. Since we're on the topic though, people being unable to play well
 consistently 'no matter what level we play on' makes no sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being teabagged happens to everyone. It's possible and even somewhat likely that they're still doing it when they learn you're female, but everyone gets teabagged. It's an online game, it happens, don't worry about it.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may try running the fixit from the below link and check if the issue gets fixed.</div>
<div><br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>A DVD may not play properly in some DVD players or DVD-ROM drives for any of the following reasons:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disc type may not be compatible. Some DVD players or DVD-ROM drives can only play certain kinds of DVDs. For example, some DVD players only play DVD+R or DVD+RW discs, while others only play DVD-R or DVD-RW discs.</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disc quality may be too low. Some DVD players or DVD-ROM drives will not play DVDs if the disc is not in good repair or if it is not a high-quality disc. If your player can't play a DVD, you can try burning it again using a higher-quality
 DVD.</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVD decoding software might not be installed on the computer. If you're trying to play the DVD in a DVD drive on a different computer, the DVD won't play if DVD decoding software is not installed on that computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To determine what types of DVDs your DVD player or DVD-ROM drive can play, check the documentation that came with your device or go to the manufacturer's website</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Try to follow the below provided link to Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly and check for the issue.</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also you need to contact your System manufacturer to download the latest updates for the device.</div>

<p><span>Looks like you've got some faulty hardware, unfortunately, probably the processor or perhaps the motherboard. Additional things you can
 try, though, just to see...&nbsp;<span>Ensure
 that the system has adequate cooling and ventilation. Test RAM, reseat RAM and the processor if you can. &nbsp;<span>If
 the BIOS is the latest, consider reverting to a previous version and see if that helps. If not, install the latest BIOS. Also double-check BIOS settings; perhaps, note current settings, reset the BIOS defaults, and then adjust those settings you know are necessary
 to adjust. &nbsp;Double-check voltage, etc. and ensure/verify CPU compatibility with the motherboard. &nbsp;If you're overclocking, stop.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The
 dump shows you got fatal machine check exceptions due to bus errors. &nbsp;The specific errors are &nbsp;BUSLG_GENERIC_ERR_*_TIMEOUT_ERR and&nbsp;BUSLG_OBS_ERR_*_NOTIMEOUT_ERR. &nbsp;If the above steps don't help, consider checking into the remaining warranty on the processor

            Hi. I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems, but I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />You can download the Media Creation tool to create a disk image. It can be found here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if that solves the problem. I'll keep working with you to resolve this issue.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The Media Creation Tool may help. Make sure to backup your PC before continuing. Go to this page:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />Click "Download tool now" then run the application. On the "What do you want to do?" page, select "Upgrade this PC now," and then select "Next." When Windows 10 is ready to install, select "Change what to keep" to set whether you would like to "Keep personal files and apps," or "Keep personal files only," or choose to keep "Nothing." Be sure to have a backup of your personal data, settings, and applications if you choose to "Keep personal files only" or choose to keep "Nothing."
<br />
<br />If you cannot run the Media Creation Tool on that PC, download it on a working PC with Windows. You will need a blank USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of storage space. The Media Creation Tool will allow you to boot a Windows installer from the USB flash drive you selected.
<br />
<br />During the Windows installation, you may be asked for a Windows product key. Select "I don't have one" or equivalent. On the next page, select Windows 10 Home or Pro: Windows 10 Home if your PC came with Home and Windows 10 Pro if your PC came with Pro. Windows should automatically activate after the installation when you connect to the internet. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any questions, and if this does not work, there are other steps you can try.

            Hi Ron, are you having a problem opening all exe files, is that the reason you want to re-install - if so we can probably fix that if it is the only issue you have . .. 
<br />
<br />If you want to create Windows 10 Installation Media:
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool

    <title>Surface Pro Windows Hello driver missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sadtler-&#91;xboxvenue&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro Windows Hello driver missing</h2>
                    Purchased a Surface Pro (2017 model) yesterday. I set up the computer and activated Windows Hello. It worked fine until this afternoon, when I rebooted and received a message "can't turn on camera, please enter PIN." I've searched the forums and I've found
 the advice to go to Device Manager and update the driver for Surface Camera Windows Hello, except I do not have this device listed in Device Manager. After several more reboots, the Windows Hello feature works again but the device is still not listed in Device
 Manager. What should I do? I'm afraid I have a malfunction somewhere and it will continue to pop up intermittently.&nbsp;

<p>Many thanks - I am glad that you found this missing driver, as I cannot find the device (even with view disconnected devices in Devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing most suggested fixes including:</p>
<p>- latest pack for my Surface Pro 2017 from Microsoft, rebooted &amp; nil</p>
<p>- uninstall the IR camera &amp; reboot</p>
<p>- log in with local profile, turn off the PIN, and switch back to a Microsoft account</p>
<p>- turn on biometrics in the group policy</p>
<p>- boot up with the volume &amp; power button</p>
<p>- etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short it is merely the missing driver/device that the Sep update seems to have taken out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of the specific driver is required to get the missing&nbsp;surface camera windows hello back up and running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

</p><p>Have you tried installing the drivers manually from the MSI package found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Pro Drivers and Firmware page?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 packages available to download and install, based on the build number of Windows you have installed. If you are not sure, run
<em>winver</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Creators Update - SurfacePro_Win10_<strong>15063</strong>_1706207_0.msi<br />
Windows 10 Fall Creators Update - SurfacePro_Win10_<strong>16299</strong>_1710007_0.msi</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled both MSI packages. &nbsp;The driver was either not in the package or it didn't install. &nbsp;I could not see any errors during the installation process. &nbsp; I could not see any obvious items in the windows event viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or additional avenues to go down welcome. &nbsp;It is quite a bad advertisement whenever I unlock the computer to see the error stating that 'something went wrong'. &nbsp;I liked the feature when facial recgonition was turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is almost as there are two problems (1) the Windows Hello camera device is missing and (2) the registry or some setting is still set trying to invoke the 'unlock with facial recognition'. &nbsp; The account parameter screens, for toggling facial recognition
 on or off, are not available, given the root issue, so I am surmising that there are registry/preferences still set, although those screens are no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't particularly have the time or inclination to reinstall - especially as people with this problem (other threads on the web) hit the problem again when updates were installed again.</p>
<p>
