<h2>            Resetting windows 10 fails at 30&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to reset my windows 10 and it has been stopping at 30%. It says undoing changes and an error message pops up and says 'There was a problem resetting your pc'. I have tried going on advanced startup and launching cmd, and writing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>cd %windir%\system32\config&nbsp;<br />
ren system system.001&nbsp;<br />
ren software software.001&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I write the last line (the one with software), it says 'cannot access file because it is being used by another process'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">In Windows 7 I've had about 10+ Mbps of upload speed, but after upgrading to Windows 10, my upload speed decreased to around 300 Kbps. Every other computer, that isn't on Windows 10, in the house seems to get more than 10+ Mbps besides
 mine. Would be really awesome if someone helped me get this fixed!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Louis,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We understand how you feel when things doesn‚Äôt work as expected. I will certainly assist you fix these issues.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try these steps and check if they works. <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: If the issues persists run Internet performance Troubleshooter and check if that helps.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press Windows key +X, select Control panel<br />
2.&nbsp;Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons<br />
3.&nbsp;Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel<br />
Run the Internet Connection troubleshooter.<br />
Method 3: If the issues persists update the network adapter driver and check if that helps.<br />
1)&nbsp;Press Windows key + X<br />
2)&nbsp;Click Device Manager<br />
3)&nbsp;Once device manager is open, select Network adapter, right click it and click Update Driver Software<br />
This will launch the update driver software wizard, which presents two options.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Search automatically for updated driver software - its possible Windows might have the driver software if you have not checked it yet, if its taking too long, then the next option is usually best.
<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Browse my computer for driver software - if there is a compatible driver and you already have the driver files, then all you need to do is point to it and Windows automatically install it for you.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Click Next and wait while the wizard completes the installation. <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Set the system in Clean Boot and check if that fixes the issues.<br />
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or
 determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

<span>Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this. Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi De Captain Now,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear this as I'm sure it is very frustrating. You said you sent It in twice with in a year, do you remember what they said they issues was when you had sent it in? Also aside from a power cycle, have you tried uninstalling and re installing
 those games? Id check any game specific forums to see if its onw the other end causing these issues. It sounds like you might want to get back in touch with support and explain that its been repaired two times with in that timespan.&nbsp; Possibly looking into
 having to schedule another repair. Best of luck and hope everything works out.</p>

            Ive tried the factory reset while keeping my games and i did it with removing everything still no change. The first time i sent it im was a factory default it wouldnt play any games out of the box, the second as i mentioned was caused by the console update
 in february. After i got my xbox back they called me a week later to check in and see if there were qny peoblems and i didnt have any yet. A couple days later madden 19 froze mutiple times then R6 siege started doing it and now i cant even start monster hunter
 world becuase it freezes on start up. And i dont get any error codes after the games crash just a black screen then it returns tovthe home screen. THIS WOULD BE THE 4th time in just over a year i would sending it in if i have too :/

            Alright new update, i can play madden 19 and R6 siege withoit freezing ( Normally they freeze within a few minutes of starting but i was able to play multiple games on each today). Still no luck with monster hunter world and now Sea of theives crashing
 everytime I start it with no error codes and i was playing it with no problems just a couple of day ago. Do you guys think my cloud saves/my profile got corruptes somehow for those online games?

<p>Hey there De Captain Now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you've found yourself dealing with this issue. </p>
<p>It could be. It depends on what caused this issue in the first place and whether or not this happens when you try on&nbsp;another Xbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after reviewing all the troubleshooting steps that you've already taken, I would say that your console is more than likely in need of another&nbsp;service or repair. I would contact customer support as @<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/04aff29e-aa71-441a-8d3b-0976139b37d4" title="XBF Brad A"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">XBF
 Brad A</span></a>&nbsp; had suggested and see if an agent can notate that the console be replaced rather than repaired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h2>            8.1 windows update issue</h2>
                    Ever since the update, my system has crashed over and over again, I removed the update, and stopped the update for now, however you should really look into the issue and correct it.

    <title>Gamertag change denied&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hate ignorance  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag change denied&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I tried changing my Gamertag today, and it would have let me proceed to officially changing it, but I didn't have enough Microsoft points. I was about to add some, but I remembered that I needed to ask permission from the credit card owner first. I didn't
 finish the final step.</p>
<p>2 hours later, I return with permission to purchase. I'm about to put my new Gamertag as my motto because I was seeing how it would look to other people. When I enter it however, it tells me "Your motto contains a word or phrase that isn't allowed." I thought
 this was odd, but I continued to go through to change my Gamertag again, and it tells me that this Gamertag is already in use. I try sending a message to the account, but it says it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I think this is what happened:</p>
<p>1) In the few hours I was gone, Xbox Live updated their word filter to not allow my Gamertag to be created, or displayed on a profile.</p>
<p>And/Or</p>
<p>2) When I originally tried changing my Gamertag, the process went so far that the system incorrectly noted that the Gamertag I was trying to change to was now taken.</p>
<p>Either way, I contacted Xbox Support, and the woman I talked to suggested to post on the forum, and also to wait 24 hours to see if anything had changed.</p>
<p>My question is this:</p>
<p>Why was my Gamertag change rejected? Because of my theories above, or some other reason? The Gamertag in question is not inappropriate. Is this something along the lines of an incorrect word block, like how the word "fabulous" is not allowed in a profile?</p>
<p>Much appreciated for a reply.</p>

<p>I tried changing my GT, and it WAS allowed, and also in the profile. A few hours later, it is NOT allowed anymore, as a GT or in a profile. The GT is not inappropriate or offensive</p>
<p>Why? Is the filter broken? Was it updated in those few hours?</p>

            <p>Hello Tony Braunmuller,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's good to know that you're now able to view your Outlook.com emails without any problem. With regard to the error you encounter stating "cannot open this file. error Ox80004005" when accessing Windows Live Mail to retrieve your emails, kindly verify if
 the emails in your account are still intact by signing in to <a href="https://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.outlook.com</a> via web browser on your computer. If they're still intact, just reconfigure your account in Windows Live Mail to download the emails from your account to your computer. Click
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> for assistance on how to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, were you able to export the emails from the program before repairing it? If yes, please navigate to the location where you created the backup file to check if your emails are still intact. Once you determine that your emails are intact, you can retrieve
 your messages by importing them again to your Windows Live Mail by&nbsp;referring to the help article provided by
<strong>Ralph_YS</strong> for assistance on importing emails into the mail client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how things turn out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I don't believe this is a problem with settings. I believe I have all of my settings and advanced settings adjusted correctly. My computer is trying to Sleep at the appropriate times, and with the appropriate buttons. It just shuts down immediately after
 it attempts to go into Sleep mode.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest&nbsp;you to try&nbsp;this and check: </p>
<p><span>This issue could be either due to some issues with the power settings or corrupted system files on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the below methods and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Run the Power Troubleshooter
</span></em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>Type ‚Äú<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>‚Äù in the search bar and press ‚Äú<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>‚Äù.</span></li><li><span>In the ‚Äú<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>‚Äù window, click on ‚Äú<strong><em>View All</em></strong>‚Äù on the left pane.</span></li><li><span>Click on ‚Äú<strong><em>Power</em></strong>‚Äù.</span></li><li><span>Click on ‚Äú<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>‚Äù and then click on ‚Äú<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>‚Äù.</span></li><li><span>Click ‚Äú<strong><em>Next</em></strong>‚Äù and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It could be a compatibility issue with the new
<strong>Fast Startup component</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the below steps and check:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>
Control Panel</strong> / <strong>Power&nbsp;Options</strong>. </span></li><li><span>On the Left side menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Change settings&nbsp;that are currently unavailable</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Scroll down to the

<strong>Save Changes</strong>&nbsp;Button.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Shut Down</span></strong><span> the computer, wait a couple of minutes
 and then use the <strong>Power Button</strong> to start the computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to restore default settings of power plan and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>Click on the

            You should have a restore partition that will reinstall Windows 7. <span>

<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ÔªøMost computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows 7. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restoreÔªø
 - check your manual if you're not sure how to. If you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process. Reinstalling will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you don't have the restore partition or install disks:</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.

            <p>Did you HP laptop come preloaded with Windows 7?</p>
<p>HP laptops come preloaded recovery partition will allow you to create a set of Hp restore disks that can be used to recover all of the original software in the event of a major problem by tapping the F10 key continuously when the PC is first boots up. However,
 there may be times when recovery discs are needed to restore the PC. By using the Recovery CD-DVD Creator program, you can create a set of recovery discs to restore your PC back to its original condition.<br />
Creating A Restore CD</p>
<p>The recovery CD set contains a complete set of the original operating system, drivers, and application software that shipped with the PC. The Recovery CD Creator software can be used to creat a set of recovery CDs for your computer. Because this software
 actually contains the Operating System, the Creator program allows only one complete set of CDs to be created. This data that will be put onto the CD is the same as the recovery CDs that you‚Äôd receive if you‚Äôd actually ordered them from HP.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll need a blank CD-R or blank DVD-R.</p>
<p>To begin, click Start, then All Programs. If you have an HP Pavilion click Hewlett-Packard and then HP PC Recovery CD Creator. If not, try clicking PC Help &amp; Tools, then HP CD Recovery CD-DVD Creator to start the program.</p>
<p>You will see a welcome screen. Click the Continue button on each screen to start the disc creator. You will see how many disks are necessary to create the HP recovery disks. Label them, so you do not get confused after each burn.</p>
<p>The disk will burn, verify data, then eject each CD when complete. When the process is complete, you should have a working set of HP restore disks.</p>
<p>You will not be able to create another set, so if you lose or damage these disks, you‚Äôll need to contact HP for a replacement.</p>

    <title>Printer issue with new Win 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> self-defense  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer issue with new Win 10 upgrade</h2>
                    When I purchased my Lenovo PC some years ago, it came with win 7. I had a HP Photosmart 1115. The printer would not work with 7. An answer from the community helped by "faking out" the computer to think that the 1115 was actually an HP 970cse. I cannot
 remember how I was instructed to do that but it has worked ever since on Win 7 AND with my laptop running Win 10 from WIFI. Well now that I have upgraded to 10 on my PC, the "fake" HP 970cse is not recognized period. Is there a clever expert way to once again
 get my old Photosmart(which runs almost a year on print cartridges) to be able to be connected somehow? HP has "retired" both the 1115 and the DeskJet 970cse. I hope that some one has an easy solution as the gentleman had for this situation some years ago(besides
 buy a new printer). Thanks so much.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The drivers for printer are developed by the manufacturer. I suggest you to check with the manufacturer for the available drivers for your printer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Or you can try installing the Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode and check if it resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the program in the compatibility mode.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a program or driver written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't run properly in current Windows, then you could try using
<strong>compatibility mode</strong> on the program to hopefully allow it to run properly.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the program/game in the compatibility mode and check if it helps. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the program icon, click on
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click the <strong>
Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Check the <strong>
Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong> box and select the Preferred <strong>
Windows</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>
Apply</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> button.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the issue will be resolved. If you need any further assistance, please feel free to contact us again. We will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

 Windows 7. &nbsp;Be sure to back up your files and have the installation media or download files for your programs handy. &nbsp;If you made changes to user accounts or created a new one, reverse this and try again.</p>

            <p>Hi Colin&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the speedy reply. &nbsp;I installed windows 7 many years ago and don't know where I might find the recovery media. &nbsp;I read elsewhere that windows 10 needs the windows.old file to roll back. &nbsp;That is still there which is why I am confused. &nbsp;I did contact
 what i thought was microsoft support by a chat function but when he said he wanted remote access to my computer I started to wonder if it was a scam. &nbsp;What do you reckon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My immediate problem with my new Epson WF-2630 printer is that it prints in draft mode. &nbsp;If I go into the printer preferences dialogue the option to apply changes to the default settings is greyed out. &nbsp;COuld this be a windows 10 permissions problem? I think
 that I have set the permissions for all users that they can make changes but don't know if I have done &nbsp;it properly.</p>

            <p>The request to remotely control your computer is legit and the method used by Microsoft Answer Desk agents to repair or reconfigure a system. &nbsp;Recontact Support and permit the access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, however, you should see if Epson has drivers and software for your printer that is updated for Windows 10.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This software is dated 9/16/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use the Epson forums for advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rolling back should be your last option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to start backing up your system. &nbsp;I make periodic system images with the Create System Image tool in Control Panel/Security and Maintenance/Backup and Restore (Windows 7), upper left corner of the screen. &nbsp;I also use a third-party Backup and Restore
 program to make regular backups of all my files and folders.</p>

<h2>            Ethernet &#38; Wi-fi &#34;does not have a valid IP configuration&#34;</h2>
                    <div>Hi Everyone,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I bought a a Lenovo IdeaPad P400 Touch laptop last week, with Windows 8 64-bit OS. I went through the general setup and had the computer working in no time; wireless and Ethernet connections worked fine for a few days and then I began getting "Limited"
 connectivity errors on both the Wi-fi and Ethernet.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After the initial setup, I ran windows update and tried to install vmVare, then I realized this "Limited Connectivity" problem. After that, I uninstalled the vmware and all other software I had installed since I received the laptop but internet connectivity
 was not restored.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Nearly frustrated over this, I restored my laptop to its initial (factory setup) status and re-installed the Windows 8 OS that the manufacturer stored on a built-in D drive, using the Lenovo OneKey Recovery process.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>During the restoration process, I had to re run Windows setup (like a new computer). I had hoped this would reverse any issues I had with internet connectivity, but it did not work. In fact, Windows 8 could not connect to the internet during setup and
 I had to create a local account to finish the setup.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After completing the setup, I visited the windows 8 forums and tried using a recommended solution for re-setting tcp/ip (netsh winsock reset catalog and netsh int ip reset reset.log hit), restarted my laptop but the problem still persists.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>I even ran an IPResetAll app posted by Chev65 on the WindowsEightForum, but got the below output instead:</u></b></div>

<h2>            Download Speed &#47; Unable to Play Game Pass PC</h2>
                    I use google fiber and have a 500Mb connection but for some reason on the game pass launcher the games I am downloading are topping out at 10MB/s. When I downloaded updates for games on Steam today it was atleast staying at a steady 100MB/s, both downloads
 were on the same drive. Next once metro exodus finally finished downloading 4hrs later I couldnt even play the game because it wouldn't sign in my GT. Is there anyone else encountering these issues with the Game Pass PC (Beta) launcher?
