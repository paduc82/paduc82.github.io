<h2>            Canon MP630 - Scan with Canon driver &#38; Software does not work</h2>
                    
<p>Computer is Dell Dimension 9150 running Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; Printer/scanner is Canon MP630, connected by USB.</p>
<p>Problem is: attempt to scan using Canon MP Navigator software fails (http://software.canon-europe.com/software/0034316.asp?model=).&nbsp; Press the SCAN button and nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, use the device's control panel for scan to PC, nothing happens.&nbsp; Scan to paper works OK.</p>
<p>However, from Microsoft Word, Insert--&gt;Picture--&gt;from Scanner or Camera menu: if select device "Canon MP630 ser", returns "an error occurred acquiring the picture".&nbsp; But, choosing device "WIA Canon MP630 ser" and scan works correctly.&nbsp; Shows the Canon native
 driver is installed, but not working.</p>
<p>I have installed the above software and connected the same device, same cable, to a different computer running Windows XP and scanning is successful.&nbsp; Also tried different USB ports on this computer. The problem is therefore isolated to the Windows 7 Install
 on this computer.</p>
<p>Install sequence was</p>
<p>1) Device Off &amp; disconnected: Install Canon MP Drivers (http://software.canon-europe.com/software/0037943.asp?model=)<br />
2) reboot computer<br />
3) Connect the device and power on<br />
4) Windows detects and installs the driver</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I have contacted Canon (on the European site) and had a support ticket raised.&nbsp; I have followed all of their instructions but this has not fixed the problem.&nbsp; They now say this proves it is not a problem with the device or their
 software and therefore cannot help any further.&nbsp; They suggest I should raise this with Microsoft.</p>
<p>I tried the US site on your link to see if there is further information - it seems this model is not supported in the States!</p>

    <title>Windows Repair problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrick_993  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Repair problem</h2>
                    <p>My motherboard stopped working so I bought the closest model I could find still for sale (previous board was Gigabyte H87M-D3H, new one is H97M-D3H) &nbsp;I reinstalled all three SATA HDDs (SSD with OS on it and two others), the BD player and DVD drive. &nbsp;I started
 it up, it told me that due to a hardware change I needed to repair windows. &nbsp;I put my Windows 7 Professional 64 bit disc into the drive and restarted. &nbsp;When I click on the repair option after booting from the disc, I receive the message, "The version of System
 Recovery Options is not compatible with the version of windows you are trying to repair. &nbsp;Try using a recovery disc that is compatible with this version of windows." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading other posts on this site and others, I disabled the other drives in the bios. &nbsp;That didn't work so I physically unplugged all the drives except for the windows drive and one dvd drive. &nbsp;Still I received the same error. &nbsp;I rearranged the SATA
 plugs so the boot drive with the DVD was earlier on the SATA order, then I reversed it; same error message. &nbsp;I changed the type from UEFI to P0 and back again; same error message. &nbsp;I then tried all of the above with a windows 7 Home Premium disc in case I
 made a mistake on version but had the same error. &nbsp;Finally, I downloaded a Windows 7 Professional and Home Premium ISOs w/ SP 1 from Microsoft and tried again with each of them. &nbsp;Still, I receive the same message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to not have to completely reinstall windows but I'm getting to the point where I see no other option. &nbsp;Can anyone please help?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m sorry for the inconvenience. <br />

<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error may occur if you use the 32-bit version of the Windows installation disc to run the Complete PC Restore program on a computer that is running the 64-bit version of Windows. By default, the 64-bit operating system is selected in the list of installed
 operating systems.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to check that the version of operating system you have on computer is the same on the disc.<br />

            <p>I doubt you have any other choice.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of tips if you are going to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update seems to take many, many hours after a reinstall.&nbsp; This procedure will fix that problem.</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Windows Update fix (new)</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><strong><em>The following procedure applies in the case of install (re-install) of Windows 7.&nbsp; It does not apply to usual, normal updating.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid you are going have to do the re-install again.&nbsp; Not a terrible penalty to pay.&nbsp; Usually takes way less than an hour.&nbsp; Then, immediately proceed with the following procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is strange, but it really does work and a lot of people have proven
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>BEFORE you start the re-install, download (32 or 64 bit) KB3083710 and KB3102810 in advance, and store on a USB stick</li><li>Start and complete the re-install of Windows 7 SP1</li><li><em><strong>Immediately </strong></em>after install is complete (while the system is rebooting),
<em><strong>disconnect </strong></em>the computer from the Internet.</li><li>Manually install KB3083710 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3102810 and restart.</li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>After a few minutes, you should have&nbsp;plenty of updates to download and install.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Clean Install tip</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong>before</strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong>+</strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as
 it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you. &nbsp;I verified the OS as W7x64. &nbsp;I went through those additional links you posted and am running into the same error. The error occurrs right as I click "repair your computer" so I'm unable to access any of the menu items in most of these guides.
 &nbsp;Since I posted, I also downloaded and tried to use Paragon Adaptive Restore. &nbsp;It allowed me to install the new drivers for my board but when I restart it gives me the same hardware error. &nbsp;When I go back to the W7x64 disc and try to get to "repair your computer,"
 the same error. &nbsp;In Paragon, it recognizes that I have W7x64 installed on the SSD and allows me to run their corrective tools but again. &nbsp;While it says the tool was successful, booting will still not work, listing the same error I got initially. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got it to work finally. &nbsp;While entering the setup utility, I hit f8 which took me to the windows boot menu. &nbsp;I selected safe mode with command prompt. &nbsp;It took me into the same menu when booting from a windows disc. &nbsp;I clicked repair and received the above
 error. &nbsp;When I let it boot regularly from the disc, I clicked "repair" and it immediately brought me to the place I needed to be, automatically repaired my startup issue, and booted into Windows. &nbsp;How this worked still does not make sense to me...but it did.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to those of you who helped.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 refresh not working - Slow performance - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 refresh not working - Slow performance</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right basically this is what's happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/ Originally installed Windows 7 pro&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/ Took advantage of Microsoft's offer of a upgrade to Windows 8 - Downloaded and received a product key via email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3/ Recent did an 8.1 update through windows store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after some time the pc is running very slow and so decided to do a refresh, which windows is telling me I can't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try and put my windows 8 disc in, but it says "incorrect media", well something along them lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now refreshing would be the quickest way, but after all my searching and messing about, I may as well have Backed it up and done a clean install and revert back to windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to give windows 8 a try and got used to it, even though it must be the worst operating system they have ever thrust upon us. I've been using it for the best part of a year, originally started with the preview version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone can help then that would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p><span>Hi Anthony,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We apologize for the inconvenience. The slow performance of Windows 8.1 may occur due to many reasons.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Third-party application conflict.</span></li><li><span>Virus infection.</span></li><li><span>Corrupted system files.</span></li><li><span>Many programs in start-up.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you mentioned, refreshing would be best option to fix this issue. However, refreshing will remove apps that you have installed from websites and DVDs. Then apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled.
 Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand backing up the data and performing clean installation is time consuming. So, before refreshing the computer, we will try some basic troubleshooting steps which may fix this issue.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices other than mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.

            <p>Thank you for replying to me, it is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried what you recommended, but only slight improvement when nothing gets loaded at boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I will have to do a clean install. But, I would like to do a refresh , but for some reason it will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I paid for an upgrade to windows 8 from an offer Microsoft was offering, I then I did an 8.1 upgrade through Microsoft &nbsp;app store. The system refresh is not possible, because my Key is not for 8.1. I can't understand why I should need an 8.1 key.
 I bought a Windows 8 key, so I would have thought 8.1 was just an update. Therefor it would appear that my 8.1 is illegal, but, it was supplied by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also just tried doing an upgrade 8.1 feature and it proceeded to ask me to input my key, my windows 8 key is invalid, because it is not an 8.1 Key. How can this be? Is this a problem that microsoft have forgotten about when they rushed through updates/upgrades,
 because of the start menu issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does appear, through searching online. I am not the only person by far that is having this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am digressing now , so if you have any info on this and any more recommendations / solutions, I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks......Tony</p>

<p>&gt;</p>
<p>Then 'Linkin PARK' tuned me up: "I tried so HARD, and got so FAR ..." ( as your Steps#3+)...</p>
<p>...but in the END it didn't EVEN matter at all!"</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>Despite my years prior experience with XP 2000 my 'senile' confusions &nbsp;frustrated me for months with many trips to Library for Tech Books including "Win8 for Dummies"! Those helped SOME &amp; started making business progress. That Win store version of W8.1 seemed
 OK.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>THEN my 'GEEK SQUAD' subscription ran out and my system seemed to DE-evolve LIKE YOURS! No chance of 'reverting' to trusty old XP2000 'Professional' for me! NOW get Error Mess saying:</p>
<p>"Win 8.1 could NOT be Installed" on some new Apps TRIED so far even AFTER I did Troubleshooter features several times!</p>

<h2>            Cannot Get My Son Signed-up Because UAE is Not Accepted</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I should have known better, but I believed the hype and bought an xbox for my son. &nbsp;Now he wants a live account and since he is under age, I must sign-up to manage his account according to the instructions. &nbsp;However, I tried this and it wants a credit
 card for age verification (a bit like those fraudulent websites that ask for this). &nbsp;The problem is that it does not appear to accept the Dubai as a mailing address for the credit card.</p>
<p>I tried thinking like a Microsoft engineer to see if there could be a solution, but that hurt my brain after a while. &nbsp;I tried the online chat which after a 30 minute wait could not answer some basic questions and ended the chat while I was following his
 instructions on the console.</p>
<p>Is there a way to solve this? &nbsp;If not, shouldn't Microsoft have a very visible notice at the point of sale in countries where the product does not work so people like myself don't waste their time and money???</p>
<p>Another interesting bit of information I received during the chat was that I cannot cancel and delete the information on my live free account which is now useless. &nbsp;I always thought I owned my information but I guess somewhere along the way I forfeited the
 rights to my personal information.</p>

<p>Hi, &nbsp;I gathered as much working through an incredibly poor user interface during registration process. &nbsp;This information would have been more useful before I purchased the unit... &nbsp;Does your company plan to warn prospective buyers of this BEFORE they purchase
 the unit? &nbsp;What do I do with it now???</p>

<p>you mean the fact that you cannot buy UAE ms points and UAE membership cards in UAE isn't enough?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;it is upto your local stores to have the notices if you noticed the cards aren't in whatever your local supported languages&nbsp; wouldn't that trigger some questions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the actual xbox boxes there is a warning xbox live is not supported in all regions</p>
<p>selling hardware doesn't mean you have full&nbsp;online &nbsp;services as they are 2 completely different licenses</p>

<p>I just went to the link in the Ambassador's post. &nbsp;Guess what, it recommends "If your country/region is not on the list, please check back with us soon..." but a massage at the top of the page reads: "Revised December 9, 2010." &nbsp;Wow, they have not added
 a country in a year!!! &nbsp;I wonder how long before Dubai which happens to host Microsoft's regional headquarters will be added to the list...</p>
<p>I think you are right, I should complain against the distributers and force them to disclose this at the point of sale.</p>
<p>For your information, English is the most prevalent language in the UAE and most electronic products are marketed and configured in English only.</p>
<p>I still don't know what to do with this thing? &nbsp;Any creative ideas. &nbsp;I probably won't get my money back so I must think of something useful to do with it... &nbsp;I am open to any creative suggestions.</p>
<p>The suggestion should be unique and make a good video for youtube. &nbsp;All suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>i'd imagine there is certain laws restricting content and communications</p>
<p>best bet is to contact your local content governing body selling hardware isn't the same as selling online services as they include communication services</p>
<p>&nbsp;usually ratings body or the commerce</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>every xbox live card ms points and membership cards have region codes</p>
<p>if you do not see UAE on the card its not from your region</p>
<p>USA is US and CA for canada</p>

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

<h2>            Generic DirectX error. CyberLink Power2Go does not support the current screen resolution and DPI setting</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
When I'm trying to run a game called Quadra on my Windows 8 pc. I get 2 error messages. The first one says: Generic DirectX error. And the second one doesn't always pop up but it says: CyberLink Power2Go does not support the current screen resolution and DPI
 setting. <br />
<br />
The game is old, but worked on my windows XP. I have tried to change the properties/ compability options of the program to: Run this program in compability mode for windows xp service pack 3. And i have also tried to reduce the colours and resolution etc.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to run this program or should I give up?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Downloadlink just in case: http://code.google.com/p/quadra/downloads/list<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping<br />

            <p>Hi Rasmus, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have tried the compatibility option and the issue remains. I would recommend you to contact the
<strong>game(Quadra) Support</strong> as they might have released some<strong> patches</strong> for that game which would enable you to play the game in Windows 8. They can also tell you if there are some things that needs to be enabled for the game to work
 in Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply if you have any questions. </p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you able to use any other USB devices on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s try these steps and check if helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong><span><br />
<br />
<span>You may check in services if the plug and play service is enabled.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Type "services.msc" in the start search box and press "Enter”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Double-click on the service named "Plug and Play".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Check the value in the “Startup type” the device needs to be “Started and automatic”.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also check in device manager if the external hard drive is listed there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Connect the external hard drive to the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. To open device manager, type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Check if the external hard drive is listed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. In device manager, expand the hard drive listed in the device list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. If the hard drive is listed, right click on it &gt;click Properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. In General, under device status check for the message. Post back if there is any error message.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Additionally, also run the “Hardware and Device troubleshooter” and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span>For more information, refer this link.</span></p>

    <title>Homegroup Install Printer button doesn&#39;t do anything. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozzyrulez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Homegroup Install Printer button doesn&#39;t do anything.</h2>
                    
<p>A friend called me over this evening to set up his homegroup. The setup is a desktop hooked to a Belkin wired/wireless router by Cat 6 cable and a Compaq laptop via wireless. Both machines are connected to the homegroup and are sharing files with no issues,
 both also have internet connectivity. All check boxes for sharing are checked. The problem is the shared homegroup printer. When I go into homegroup on the laptop it says there is a new shared printer. However when I click the "install printer" button it does
 nothing. The only thing it does is change color, the blue shift when you click it. I have disconnected both machines from the homegroup and recreated it multiple times, with the same results. The printer works fine on the desktop its connected to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seen another thread on here with multiple steps to follow to get it to work. I followed all these steps and still nothing. I have tried adding the printer via the add printer wizard and it cannot find the printer. I have tried stopping and restarting the
 printer spooler service as well. Nothing I have tried is working. Any ideas would be great.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>What steps have you followed and from which thread?</p>
<p>In the meantime, follow these steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Temporarily disable all security software and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a></p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats.&nbsp; In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn off User Account Control</a> (UAC) and then try.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> User Account Control (UAC) can help prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. UAC notifies you when changes are going to be made to your computer that require administrator-level permission. These types of changes can affect the
 security of your computer or can affect settings for other people that use the computer. We recommend that you leave UAC on to help make your computer secure.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Perform <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC scan</a> and check if the issue is related to missing or corrupted system files. SFC scan recovers and repairs system files.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Put your computer in a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a> state and check if you are able to install the printer.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Follow step 7 to restart your computer as normal</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a new user account</a> and try to install the printer. If the issue is resolved in a new user account, most probably you had a corrupted user profile and may
 want to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
fix it</a> .</p>
<p>Also, have a look at this thread. If you haven't followed the steps given by Afzal Taher, please follow the steps and post back with the status of the issue.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
See this thread for information on using BlueScreenView, MyEventViewer, and other methods to<br />
troubleshoot BlueScreens - top two answers.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/8df6485a-50cc-4cdc-be3e-0f05c7745117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/8df6485a-50cc-4cdc-be3e-0f05c7745117</a><br />
<br />
==============================================</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
At the end of this message I will post a generic bluescreen troubleshooter and in the next<br />
message how to update drivers and BIOS as well as do memory checks.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p>If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.</li><li>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.</li><li>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS. </li><li>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</li><li>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed. </li><li>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination. </li><li>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.<br />
<br />
<strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>Before upgrading to a new version of Windows, remove all third-party device drivers and system services, and disable any virus scanners. Contact the software manufacturers to obtain updates of these third-party tools.<br />
<br />

Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to start BITS service. The issue could be if you are not logged in as an Administrator or you don't have the admin permission.

<strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate <strong>Windows Update</strong> service.</span></p>
<p><span>c. <strong>Right click </strong>on the Windows Update service and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In <strong>Start-up type</strong>, select <strong>Enable</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>Start</strong> under <strong>Service status</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>g. <strong>Repeat the steps c</strong> to f for the following <strong>services</strong> also:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Background Intelligent Transfer Service &amp; Cryptographic Service.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If these steps do not help to resolve the issue, then you may proceed with the step mentioned below and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Step by step instructions to get the issue fixed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
b) On the open <strong>Command Prompt </strong>window <strong>copy and paste </strong>
the commands (all at once) <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>net stop wuauserv<br />
<br />
net stop cryptSvc<br />
&nbsp;<br />
net stop bits<br />
<br />
net stop msiserver<br />
<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
<br />
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old<br />
<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
<br />
net start cryptSvc<br />
<br />
net start bits<br />
<br />
net start msiserver</strong></span></p>
<p><span>c) Wait for the process to complete.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d) Close the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, try to install Windows Updates again and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Simple PCI Communications Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heyyou26  say:</h3>
<h2>            Simple PCI Communications Controller</h2>
                    For the longest time I have had this annoying popup on my Windows desktop. You close it and it pops back up atleast 50 times then maybe it will be done. I don't know what the simple PCI Communications Controller is aside from annoying. How do I make it
 go away? Why is it even popping up? I have simply ignored the problem by not using it. There were other things going on with the PC, I don't remember I dealt with it by installing a second operating system on this and forgot about the problem. No problems
 after that, I figure its a problem with the operating system and I'd like to just reinstall it but gateway(bad) wants money for the install disk.<br />
<br />
I also have a windows pop up stating Driver Installation Module has stopped working. I think its trying to install that PCI driver. Is there a way to fix this? I threw up my hands and said Windows is being stupid. The reformat option has been used a few times
 a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Whats up with the incredibly short support period for Vista anyway? I don't follow it but I saw something about them ending support for the OS.<br />
<br />
Also there seems to be an unnecessary barrier in reading the Ubuntu Partition from Vista but The Ubuntu OS can access the Vista side?<br />
<br />

Looked at link and scratch head.<br />
That looks like its talking about windows update or something? I am genius yes I know.<br />
<br />
Anyway forgetting everything I just looked at and go to "Device Manager"/"System Devices"and now I am going to click every Intel(R) and tell it to update<br />
<br />
http://i48.tinypic.com/2n234ag.jpg<br />
<br />
And Windows has determined that my drivers are up to date. Think that's what I was asked to do? I believe I have run Windows Update a few times in the past hoping for a fix, letting it run now. Not crossing fingers.<br />
<br />

This I think is the more interesting screen shot. Don't understand what is going on with that at all.<br />
<br />
Anyway hopefully this helps.<br />

            Windows update prompted a restart and went into a blue screen in the down phase of the restart. I don't believe this is an issue aside from updates being applied. From appearances the updates were successful. The PCI is still popping up but that's to be
 expected at this point. Opening windows update to check on and looking at additional optional updates that I see LSI - Network - LSI PCI - SV92PP Soft Modem. I'm going to tell it to install that update too (again I believe I have done this before) I don't
 expect it to work, something like update failed is what I expect to see. <br />
<br />
I haven't seen it enough to call it a pattern but when I shut the computer down from Windows it seems to hang.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to just reinstall the operating system? I have the Product key sticker on my computer still. I don't have the OS disk but have been thinking maybe I could download it for the reinstall. Quick look turns up this<br />
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5828991/Windows_Vista_Home_Premium_SP2_%2864_Bit%29_x64_%28September_2010%29<br />
<br />
Mine says Service pack 1 this Service Pack 2 only visible difference and what I remember from older computers is service packs were installed by Windows update but I don't see that here.<br />
<br />
Anyway just an idea at this point.<br />
<br />
... and the LSI update failed to install!<br />
<br />
I'm going to say the blue screen from update was probably more the reason for the install of a second OS than the PCI desktop background.<br />

<div>capturing with that device. You state that playback is fine using the supplied</div>
<div>ArcSoft software. I don't know I they officially support playback with other</div>
<div>programs and what those programs are under Windows 8. It could be an issue</div>
<div>caused by the codecs used with their software and compatibility with Windows 8.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughts.&nbsp; I have emailed Arcsoft support and am awaiting their response.&nbsp; Of course I realize&nbsp; they have no responsibility to support performance in other companies programs, but it seems to me that if their software runs under Windows then
 what gets recorded by their program should at least be able to play in Windows (Media Center).&nbsp; And it's not simply a Windows 8 thing - I have the same problem in XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We shall see.</p>

    <title>Problem with Windows 10 crashing or locking up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with Windows 10 crashing or locking up</h2>
                    <p>I have been with Windows 10 for 3 years and never had any problems with it. Now just last week it is freezing up and then crashes.&nbsp; It is extremely frustrating especially when you are in the middle of playing a game and without warning it freezes up and
 the only way I can get it to work again is b clicking the X on the corner of the page and goin out of it and restarting it but then you have to start the game over again too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Norton tool repair kit free program and it didn't seem to fix it. They insisted that they wanted me to upgrade to the one that you have to pay for in order to do so and I am not well&nbsp; that well off in being on a fixed income. I tried deleting
 or removing several files off my hard drive but every time I go and play a game online or the card games associated with the Windows 10 package it still freezes up.&nbsp; I also get the error message saying that it is not responding. I also went with AVG but the
 same thing in order for me to download the repair one they want money for it.&nbsp; And Windows 10 just sends you to the same one put out by Norton telling you to download the version that you have to pay for. And I keep getting the messages from them telling me
 that my system has crashed and to perform a scan with the one that they want you to buy.&nbsp; I live in Canada and don't feel like paying twice as much for a program only to discover it doesn't work. Stupid part is it doesn't seem to do it all the time.&nbsp; And I
 am not that sure what you mean with the cleaner program. In that one line about seeing what one it is as I am not&nbsp; really into computers .</p>

            Hi Karen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners. 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Okay I managed to uninstall AVG but I still have the Norton one that I downloaded regarding one person saying to do so for the free version to fix the errors but when that didn't help it actually told me I had to pay so much money to upgrade to the pro one
 to get it done right and now I am getting these messages from it telling me what had&nbsp; crashed and to do a scan but with the one that you have to pay for. Sooo should I uninstall this one too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the first time I went back onto the Windows 10 page after it uninstalled the AVG everything had froze up mouse was still working but there were no icons along the bottom of my task bar. No Monitor icon Nothing telling me about the language ENG and I
 couldn't access the Windows sign on the opposite corner to get the menu coming up. So I had to unplug it from the wall as I couldn't shut it down and then plugged it back in and this time everything came up. &nbsp; When I tried to get online with Microsoft Edge.&nbsp;
 It came up with this error with a red circle and a white X in the middle saying " c:/users/owner/App Data/Roaming/Microsoft/Internet Explorer/Quick Launch/Task Bar/60/CMHNet.Ink File system error (-805305975)&nbsp; " I click on Ok and it goes off the screen. I
 don't get it that often &nbsp; Then I got this other one just now saying "Microsoft.com is not responding due to a long running script.&nbsp; " So does that help you in what it is doing??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer I have is an Acer btw.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

            Uninstall Norton.  As I said there is no expert who recommends it or any other bloated antivirus which will weigh down and cause issues with WIndows.  T
<br />
<br />Then please focus on completing the steps I gave to go over and if necessary repair your install.  Those steps will normally find and fix any problems, while you learn what works best and how to apply it yourself.

<p>Something amazing has happened.&nbsp; I did not have to go through any of the steps the two of you suggested.&nbsp; What I did this morning was take out the Norton one this morning. Then when I had to take out the AVG about 2 in the morning after using the one I had
 to pay for and then after the 30 days were up for the other one they wanted me to pay for it--but I couldn't afford to do so with living in Canada. I found out that I still had to take it out again out of my programs/files. It came up and asked me why and
 I told it that I had to pay for the one that was in addition to the free one.&nbsp; And while it was taking it out Windows Defender kicked in and came up telling me to update it and took me to its page so I clicked on updates and security and got the green checkmarks
 in doing so. Then it proceeded to take out the AVG one.&nbsp; Then I took out Norton too. from the programs and files. And no more messages. But what is even more exciting is no more crashes or errors coming up.&nbsp; I have just played 5 times on the Windows Spider
 solitaire game and no lock ups, freezing or getting kicked out. I didn't win yet as it is the hard level. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what was happening was that I would get the updates for AVG but nothing for Windows Defender so due to it I guess that is why it was crashing because as soon as I took them out of the hard drive and updated Defender they went with them.&nbsp;</p>

            Karen.  I think the problem WAS having Norton and AVG.  One should never have two antiviruses as they will fight each other, and those are two of the worst for causing issues due to the bloat.  That's why No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.

            After saying that I went to go and shut it down and it had locked up mouse was still working soooo I unplugged it from the outlet plugged it back in and that did it. So the first think I did was go into Windows Defender as it was showing a yellow triangle
 with a black exclaimation mark.&nbsp; When I clicked into it found them wanting to do my start up differently but I have always done it this way so clicked on dismiss. The second one was telling me to store all my whatever it was with one drive so I could access
 them with other hardware-phone etc. But my cell phone is too old to do that kind of thing with and furthermore I don't have any other computers, laptops or blackberries so clicked dismiss with that one as well. Ran the troubleshooting one to fix it but what
 left me scratching my head was the fact that even tho it said some apps were not working when I checked back it was showing green checkmarks and showing no issues with any of them and the yellow triangle was gone replace by a green
