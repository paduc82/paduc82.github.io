<h2>            Windows 8 crash, store lost and change pc settings won&#39;t open.</h2>
                    I have an ASUS S400CA, runnings Win8 64 bit. I purchased this laptop in February 3013, and have had significant issues since day one.&nbsp;
<div>There have been regular issues with sleep mode, as when I put the laptop to sleep it would constantly show the error 'driver not less than or equal to athw8x.sys' on waking up. The computer would also regularly hang and then crash for no apparent reason
 under various levels of load, on various surfaces. Temperature was not always high.</div>
<div>A system refresh early in the piece alleviated the issues, there were no longer any hang-crashes and the athw8x.sys error became far less common, now happening a maximum of once per day.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Earlier tonight, when I woke the laptop up, it froze on a black screen. I then forced it to shut down (holding the power button, because it shouldn't take two minutes with a thing called "instant on" installed by default) and rebooted it. Here my problems
 began; my lock screen had changed picture. Didn't think anything of it, and got to the tile screen. I tried to open Chrome. I went to the desktop and realised that Chrome, apparently, no longer existed. I thought that was odd, and then realized my desktop
 had no files on it. I then worried and rebooted, which caused the system to scan and fix the drives. The files returned. However, I am now missing most of my tiles, including Windows Store. I wanted to refresh the system, but the 'change pc settings' button
 on my toolbar will not open. Compounding this, various applications such as my virus protection and Microsoft Office uninstalled themselves.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please, I need help. I can post any documentation anyone wants if they can tell me where to find it, or specifically what they want.</div>

<h2>            Make old Games compatible in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span>Original title: Old Games and Win 10</span></p>

<p>So I have read upon the forums and NUMEROUS community troubleshooting websites that it is -impossible- to play them on the Win10 platform because of some "security" issue with the DRM methods used by games of old age. Is Microsoft going to bother doing ANYTHING
 about the issue that I am now locked out of several games I dearly miss? Or am I just assumed to be told "sorry tough luck too bad"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before anyone posts anything generic i'll shoot all&nbsp;that down now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The game I am most infuriated about is Black &amp; White 2&nbsp; which is NOT AVAILABLE DIGITALLY! Someone tell Microsoft's bestie, EA, to make it available digitally if MS doesn't wanna work with us</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Compatibility modes have no effect on this issue, it is a hardwired blockage by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I am not going to pay $80 to buy a lower grade Windows for a couple games when MS could just give us a work around or something, I'm not programmer but seriously, there has to be a loop to make it properly work. Also I lost my XP cd a LONG time ago so
 that's out too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) The NO-CD cracks (yes I'm referring illegal stuff but I own my CD so who cares) for B&amp;W2 specifically have anti-piracy coding against them to prevent gameplay so that's pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion, I ask, Can Microsoft just bloody give us a little fix or something to allow ancient games to work again? Since, as just the common sheep that pay money for goods, we can't force a company to provide an update/digital version of their game
 so we can enjoy it again. Most companies would rather laugh at our misfortune and continue pumping out new stuff (that isn't that great) than to breathe life into the dead.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately Sujata either does not play disk based games, or sticking to the company line
</p>
<p>(as all the "Support Engineers" seem to do).</p>
<p>These old disk based games, as you are no doubt aware, are fully compatible with Win10.</p>
<p>The <em>only </em>thing preventing them from launching, and running as well as they did on Win7&nbsp; is MS's
</p>
<p>DRM Blocking malware. </p>
<p>And of course we cannot expect EA to update a game of this vintage (well not any game more than say six months</p>
<p>- unless it's a DLC cash cow. ) It's not up to the developers to make a patch to circumvent a malware</p>
<p>developed by MS years down the track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"4) The NO-CD cracks (yes I'm referring illegal stuff <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
but I own my CD so who cares</span>) for B&amp;W2 specifically have anti-piracy coding against them to prevent gameplay so that's pointless."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>noCD fixes are made after the fact, so the DRM in the game cannot be coded to prevent them from working.</p>
<p>Unfortunately some noCD fixes don't work (or didn't work on my setup at the time ? ), but the vast majority
</p>
<p>of them do. I use about 70 of them, and have done for over ten years. </p>
<p>Yes I also have the disks, but never liked having to stuff around with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There are also some DRM from around '05 (Starforce &amp; Tages, but Tages released a fix) that had issue
</p>
<p>with 64bit OS's so these game have required using a noCD&nbsp; for a long time.</p>
<p>(I wish someone would have made a fix for Tony Hawk Pro2. The only game I can't get running on Win10).</p>
<p>- So, if I use noCD's anyway why should I care ? Because this malware is impacting on the unsuspecting casual Windows gamer.</p>
<p>To add insult to the whole thing, heartless MS didn't even include an appropriate error message.</p>
<p>Instead they allow people to run around wasting time and become frustrated while trying various 'run as admin' options which have absolutely no relevance to the issue. Corporate Big Brother 'bustardry' at it's worst.<br />
</p>
<p>- Have you tried the fix by <em>Deviance</em> ? His fixes have always worked well for me. I've have linked this in another B&amp;W2 thread but haven't heard if it works&nbsp; -- &nbsp;
<a href="http://megagames.com/games/black-and-white-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"In conclusion, I ask, Can Microsoft just bloody give us a little fix or something to allow ancient games to work again? "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to have to complain long and loud, but I reckon we would be whistling into the wind. MS don't care,</p>
<p>and personally, I have no faith in the <em>Feedback "app" </em>(App ? Isn't this a link ?) .
<br />
This seems to be part of the Win10 business model, and they may well have developed DRM BLocking&nbsp; as a
</p>
<p>form of extortion to force people to buy their old fav's again from the 'handy' store
<em>they</em> built into Windows, </p>
<p>or perhaps one of their friendly associate download sites ?</p>
<p>I expect we will be witnessing a lot more forced user pays in relation to Win10 as they 'develop' it further.</p>
<p>- Win10 - 'The best gaming Windows ever' - NOT !</p>

<br />
Since the link provided above contains multiple troubleshooting steps, could you tell us what steps have been tried so far?
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Arnold,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem as Macwin. I cannot do any of the steps as it just kept going back to the same error page everytime I press enter to reboot.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>We are using a Windows 7 Enterprise Volume license, that has been installed and then cloned and deployed. There have been no issues for over a year. Then just over the weekend I have had 2 users tell me that they had a message box come up indicating that
 Windows is not genuine. I ran the MGSDiag.exe tool on my PC since I have the same image as them. I've never gotten the error but here is the result:</p>

            So the update was pushed and the computers were manually activated, however the message still appears. In system properties Windows says it is activated and no other errors occur.

    <title>Is running Windows 10 inactivated software piracy&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kieranat10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is running Windows 10 inactivated software piracy&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, I was thinking about building a PC, and I heard you could run Windows 10 inactivated. Apparently, it would give you a 30 day free trial, and when the trial ended, you would lose customisation features. However, when I was using PcPartPicker, I made a
 post on the forums. Somebody said ''After the 30 day free trial, you would be pirating Windows. Microsoft will monitor you if you don't pay, and you will get locked out of your games.'' Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Actually I heard they dropped the 15+ rating its gonna be 18+ in July so I dont know if that means previously banned games can now be bought at stores there now or they still got to buy those games overseas. Hows that going anyway Violent?</p>

<p><span><span>It’s a feature on the new Skype app. The privacy setting is no longer available on the new Skype, that’s why anyone can send a message request. It’s
 up to if you want to accept or decline the message request. If you accept it then it will be added to your contact list. There are other reasons too when you are unable to have the request. Possible that specific contact is using a different Skype app that
 doesn’t have the same feature on your app, they’re using an outdated version, possible that they search for a wrong account or possible connection issue and if this issue happens to specific contact, then it could be on the other end.</span></span></p>

    <title>My Surface RT is crashing and restarting by itself. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmms_2112  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Surface RT is crashing and restarting by itself.</h2>
                    The error report after restart&nbsp;contains information about C:\Windows\Minidump. It always happens when the Surface is left unattended so it may be crashing after sleeping, even when on ac power and power settings are set to never sleep.

            The troubling part about this is that there is no pattern and I have not witnessed the crash- only the result of the restart. It happens on battery or AC. Several apps open or no apps open. I performed a refresh with no results. I did spend a good deal
 of time with Tech Support yesterday (Nov 5) and it was an issue they had not yet encountered. I had to perform a full factory reset twice, as the first reset was not successful. One thought was a corrupt sleep function although the Surface was set to never
 sleep. Although the issue has not reoccurred, I could post the details of the error reports if anyone else experiences a similar issue. Thanks

<h2>            Can&#39;t install an OS on my computer&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So I got this desktop from my grandfather it had a password and no one knows it. So I thought I'd wipe the drive and reinstall Windows. I'm trying to do it but when I'm in the setup which is on a USB it freezes up during the setup. I can't seem to download
 any OS Windows, linux, anything. The computer isn't that old and I don't know what to do. I tried switching to a different hard drive but it didn't do anything. By the way It's a Compaq computer. If anyone could please help me stop it from freezing that would
 be great. I just want to install Windows and use my desktop! Also the computer is a Compaq CQ2014.</p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd recommend disconnecting your PC from power, opening the side case of your desktop and using a can of compressed air to blow out dust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've had experience with reseating PC components before, you may also try reseating the RAM and graphics card (if possible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try using another USB drive, a different monitor, and replacing the PC's power cord. If your PC has an optical disk drive, it's recommended you use that drive for the installation of Windows along with an official Windows installation CD disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also possible that the motherboard, processor or video graphics is the cause of the freezing. For further investigation, a visit to your local computer repair store might be in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Josh.</p>

 Very rarely does it doe this while playing a game.&nbsp; Any suggestions for solutions?

<p>Hello Rider,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. When you are watching a movie try turning the controller off while watching. Sometimes also when the console sits idle even if watching movie it will sign you out. Under power and start up try increasing the inactivity for
 when it will turn off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Thank you&nbsp;Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe the issue lies with either of the two solutions you provided and here is why I think that.&nbsp; On some of the occasions, the controller was never on because I used the media remote to turn on, sign in, and play media.&nbsp; The inactivity&nbsp;timer
 was set at one hour but I know that I have watched movies before longer than an hour without touching any remotes, pausing, fast forward, or rewinding and there have been no issues of the Xbox signing out during some of those times.&nbsp; Regardless I increased
 it to two hours to test it going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been times were the signouts happen within a matter&nbsp;of minutes upon resigning in and playing media. An example, I have been watching an episode that is no longer than 40 minutes and on three occasions it has signed out on me.</p>

<p>Hello Ghost,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the additional information. Also, was giving a few things to try is all as this is a weird situation. How often do you fully shut down the console? Either by holding power button on the console, or going to the System tab and turn off console
 there? If its rarely doing this regularly can help the console and maybe this issue. Being its not consecutive and at random and different times hard to pinpoint the actual cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            Appreciate the suggestions to try, definitely took note of them just don't believe those are the culprit.&nbsp; I always hold down the home button and select turn console off, very rarely do I let it just auto off due to inactivity.&nbsp; I have done a hard reset
 last week when this issue was happening, and on previous times but does not resolve the issue.&nbsp; A few gamers were providing help earlier for this, one suggested the account resynced; completed.&nbsp; Another believes it is a network issue and suggested the manual
 port selection.&nbsp; After doing both of those it happened again&nbsp;prompting me to post this question to the forum.

<p>Hi there Ghost, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry to hear about the issue about getting signed off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the console is set to a network, and a random disconnection happens it will log off the profile due to not linking to the server. I would recommend trying a stable internet connection such as an ethernet connection.

<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; I have my Xbox&nbsp;connected to an ethernet cord to a powerline adapter because my router is in the other room and I do not want to run a cable throughout the house but prefer a wired connection over wifi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today I was changing some of the cables out as they are old and I recently just bought new ones.&nbsp; I had my Xbox on and signed in but when I unplugged the cables, all it did was lose connection to live.&nbsp; It did not sign me out like it does when I
 am watching a video in the movies and tv app</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just a little while ago I was playing a game and lost connection.&nbsp; It exited the game but did not sign the profile out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any new suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a detailed network stat twice while typing this the results are:</p>

            Does the router support wifi?&nbsp; You may want to try wireless connection over the powerline adapter.&nbsp; If in you statistics there packet is loss that is high especially for what is considered to be a wired connection.&nbsp; latency is high as well for a wired
 connection.

<p>Hey Ghost Rider,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding! I see you have really tried quite a bit of troubleshooting and are still getting signed out. Your network tests results indicate your connection is not the cause of this, so we can cross that out. I would suggest performing a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
factory reset</a> with the option to keep your games and apps. Once you sign back in, I would go for the "Manual" settings and make sure not to disable anything crucial to the setup. If this is software related, the reset should take care of it. Let us know
 how it goes! :D</p>

<strong>This thread is about a TOOL for TCP/IP leak detection (NOT fixing the problem</strong>).&nbsp;Cyber suggested a great tool - one of the few that are potent.&nbsp; The OP says he will try it, but at his convenience since he sees the issue resolved in the above

<p>
</p><p>That even aside, above PA BEAR omitted the OP mentioning he did a "thorough" scan (3 hrs.) and that most certainly wasn't the MSRT (which didn't hurt and almost certainly didn't help since it can't be set to levels nor take that long) but&nbsp;clearly was a MSE
 "full" scan.&nbsp; The OP even indicated in a special post that the threads weren't related.&nbsp; The MSE problem above doesn't belong here -
<strong>it's a request for a special tool that the OP&nbsp;accepted </strong>even if it hasn't yet been tried (if the OP ever does).</p>

                    Windows Explorer doesn't work. It is slow to load and will access and view a file but trouble shoots and restarts if I try to copy a file.

<p>Not much to go on at all (another MS Answers implementation/design deficiency/flaw) and the crystal ball is on vacation but may this will help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e6a2532b-70b2-43f8-94ed-7d30cca20a08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f12de01e-7245-409c-b87f-ee7d870bdc50" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer Extensions make up the list/menu of things you see when you right click something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An afflicted Explorer Shell extension can cause Explorer to crash - especially when using copy/paste and/or drag/drop and often to/from an external USB attached drive or device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incidents involving Acer and ASUS systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some troublesome Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Note:&nbsp; You may see this issue after the installation of Windows Update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4038777/windows-7-update-kb4038777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB4038777</a> but the Windows update is not the problem - the update patches security holes that bring the real problem to the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer or ASUS it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.&nbsp; You can always reinstall it again later if needed,
 right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when Windows feels
 threatened by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d24c2e4c-1ede-4fa6-b292-dc4a77378dcc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need help! About an hour ago I played, it and it worked perfectly fine. I turned it off to get food, and I came back and now it gets to where you see the Microsoft screen at the beginning, screen goes black, then it plays the Microsoft screen over and
 over. There are no scratches or anything on the disk. I have tried to restart, clean, everything. All of my other games work fine. Any solutions?</p>

<h3> beyonder616  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype account recovery</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; Hello,not long ago i bought a laptop and tried logging into Skype but i could not seem to be able to log in,i tried multiple passwords but i couldn't log in,I should say that i never logged in the microsoft account i just used Skype.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I can still access Skype on my PC since auto-login is enabled but i can't change the password since it prompts me into the microsoft account login page.</p>
<p>&nbsp; My primary recovery email i no longer have access too but i managed to add a new email to the profile but it won't let me use that as a recovery method.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Trying a recovery with the password recovery questions is useless they tell me i have not put enough information even though i have my profile opened from skype in another tab and &nbsp;i have all the info there + All the messages,contacts and everything on
 my PC incase i need to prove it and yet they keep telling me it is not enough information.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday one of my friend said he received a strange message on skype from me but i have not used Skype in over a month since i can't log in on the laptop,i booted up the PC and checked Skype apparently from my account to the whole friendlist some weird
 link was sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no idea how they got my password.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I heard sending the form a third time will get the account blocked until i contact the support,and i guess that might happen since the form doesn't tell me what is missing and it also doesn't give me an option to give any additional information.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Well thank you for your reply,I already said i cannot access that email,this is the third time i answered the form and nothing resulted out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I also observed put the someone tried to use your account thing on both of my accounts good thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now i have no access to that account anymore since i am forced to use the mail which i cannot use since the form is useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I already said my password was compromised during a leak since i saw it on i have been pwned so an antivirus scan won't help with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am in a worse position then i already was,thank you.</p>

<h2>            Surface Type cover not being detected</h2>
                    <p><span>I ohave a Surface Pro 3( Initially loaded with Win 8.1 but upgraded to Win10 on 31st Dec 2017), and a Microsoft surface Pro 4 type cover, that was working perfectly but now it would not work.&nbsp; Neither the trackpad or the keyboard. &nbsp; Keyboard
 backlight also is not coming on. I have since&nbsp;</span><br />

<p><span>4) Have tried with Surface Troubleshooter / diagnostic tool but to no avail</span>5) Would not prefer to reset due to revert back to Win 8.1 and lost time to update thereafter</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried the type cover on another surface and it works without error so I am certain it is not the type cover.&nbsp; I have also tried another type cover on my surface, which did not function either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>The type cover is not listed in the device manager, and when I leave the device manager open then disconnect and reconnect my type cover it does not refresh like it would normally do when a new device has been detected.&nbsp; Further, when I click
 scan for new devices / hardware changes, it still does not recognize / detect the type cover.&nbsp; Even when I press and hold the power and volume up buttons to enter the configuration menu the type cover does not function, and it appears to not recognize the
 device.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br />
