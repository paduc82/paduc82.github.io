<h2>            TERRIBLE NEW SKYPE VERSION</h2>
                    I have already abandoned Skype because of this awful new forced version of Skype on my laptop.&nbsp; Now September 1st, they will stop my old version (which works PERFECTLY) on my desktop - so I will give up Skype completely and find another way to communicate
 - many alternative options these days. The new version of Skype is just terrible (read all posted complaints) - I tried it on my laptop before deleting it completely.

Not sure this pertains to my comments about Skype (but I agree with your comments!), but they don't listen to us, unless 10M people comment!!&nbsp; I do NOT want to have my Skype contacts know when I am doing emails on ANY email contract I have.....&nbsp; I never even
 wanted my other regular email connected, but in their wisdom, they did connect them.&nbsp; They think the whole world wants to be connected every minute of the day, and we do NOT all want this.&nbsp; I would also like my old Skype version as an option - 'if it aint
 broke, why take it away?'

            Hi donaldcrowell
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Open WMP &gt; press ALT &gt; File &gt; Manage libraries &gt; Music
<br />This will list all folders where your music is in WMP.
<br />
<br />Depending upon your new player, you can create playlists or add the music there.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi DOnald
<br />
<br />Windows Media Player does not actually contain your files, it is just a view of your Music folder
<br />
<br />So, no transfer is needed, all you need to do is point that other media player library to your Music folder and it will find all the music files automatically
<br />
<br />What music player are you trying to load those files into?

<p>Hello SQUARKMAN,</p>
<p>I have done a little research trying to determine compatibility with Windows 7. It does not appear to be compatible, since its last update shows to be compatible with Windows 2000/XP.</p>
<p>You could try running it in compatibility mode, or if you have XP mode, you can try running it from within there as well to determine if you have any better success.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update &#40;1511&#41; messed up my second hard drive&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update &#40;1511&#41; messed up my second hard drive&#33; It says &#34;E&#58;&#47; is not available. The device is not ready&#34;</h2>
                    <p>So after postponing some computer related work in order to make way for this November update, I finally got my laptop up and running again but there was one major problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second hard drive (Western Digital WD3200BPVT-22JJ5T0) in my laptop is no longer accessible! Every time I try to open it up it says "E:/ is not available. The device is not ready". When I checked Disk Management, the drive doesn't have a File System
 and whats worse is that it says the drive has 100% free disk space which is impossible since I have 200 GB's worth of data inside that drive! So it's either the update formatted my second hard drive for no good reason or it messed up something in the drive
 that caused all this problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me fix this? 3 years worth of projects and data are stored in that drive and I can't afford to lose all of those hard work just because of a forced Windows update.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. I've done some tinkering last night and I think the update (1511) itself has some issues when it comes to this particular drive of mine (Western Digital). Yes, the drive has a letter (E) and I even tried changing it in hopes
 that it might fix the problem but still, Windows can't access the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the driver and still no luck. I also tried using various partition recovery tools to recover the drive but still no luck. Windows still can't access the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reverted back to the previous Windows 10 build and everything is back to normal now. The drive is usable again and fortunately all my files are still intact. I think the update itself has some problems when it comes to certain WD drives. Hopefully the
 next update fixes this issue. Thanks for your help!<br />

            <p>I have experienced the exact same problem as John and again, a roll back to a previous version resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drive is a 2TB Western Digital&nbsp;WD2001FASS internal SATA drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly the same symptoms as described above - drive showed in BIOS, Device Manager and Disk Manager and had a drive letter (in my case D:). Double clicking the drive in Explorer resulted in a "device not ready" error. Was unable to change the drive letter
 ("parameter incorrect"). Taking the drive offline and back in with Disk Management had no effect, nor did multiple reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the rollback, all was as it should be.</p>

            <p>Don't know if this will help you or others who end up here, but my hard drive issue was fixed by converting it from an MBR drive to GPT.</p>
<p>I did it the long way by moving my files off (after rolling back my Windows version), formating the drive and moving them back. Since doing that, 1511 can see the hard drive and files perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need third party software to do this without data loss if you can't simply move the files - I used Mini Tool Partition Wizard (freeware) to change the drive type - but I believe this software can do the change without moving data.</p>

            <p>Seems this problem also applies to "Anniversary Edition" of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like someone in M$ removed support for reading MBR disk partitions. ****?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>I just wasted the whole day backing up my SSD, installing fresh win10 (anniv edition) and all the drivers, and did a multitude of other things before noticing that the large HDD I use for safe storage is sort of missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"D:\ drive is not ready"</p>
<p>How many responses have the MS "helpdesk" people written asking users to waste yet more time dancing around the problem, when they probably already know why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Try to change the drive letter" is one helpful suggestion, with dozens of replies of the same error message in response, "Parameter is Incorrect"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems we finally find out that this started in update 1511, well there's a clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we have a windows update to the Anniversary edition which fixes it?</p>
<p>Currently Windows10 is broken for me &amp; I can NOT use it at all!</p>
<p>Thanks guys, nice job.</p>

<h2>            Downgrade Windows 7 Professional to Home Premium</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I think my problem resolves to "how do I downgrade from Pro to Home premium" but I'm not 100%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally took the plunge from XP to 7 when I bought a new HTPC and am seriously regretting it. The new HTPC has home premium OEM and I bought a new home premium licence for the desktop. I manage my HTPC using remote desktop and after hours of frustration
 trying to get it to work I discovered it's only available in pro and ultimate. I think the MS website is extremely misleading in claiming that home premium is all that is required to "<span>Easily
 create a home network<span>". I bought a third licence (not an upgrade) for Pro and installed it on the desktop (erroneously thinking that the server
 and not the client should have the extra features). It now seems that I need to install Pro on the HTPC. Is it correct that a machine running home premium can remote connect to a machine running Pro but not vice versa?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that's the case,
 I need to downgrade my desktop back to home premium so I can install the Pro licence on the HTPC. I tried entering the key in the anytime upgrade box but that didn't work.</span></span></p>
<p>How do I best do this?</p>
<p>In short, I have 3 licences (2 home premium and 1 Pro) and 2 of these are installed on:</p>
<p>desktop: pro</p>
<p>htpc: home premium</p>
<p>I believe I want</p>

<p>desktop:&nbsp;home premium</p>
<p>htpc: pro</p>
<p>I don't want to shell out another $200 for a fourth licence although with all the time I've spent it would probably be the most cost effective solution.</p>

<p>Windows 7 Home Premium includes standard workgroup networking for up to 10 PC's and also includes the ability to create and join a HomeGroup for simplified networking and sharing files and resources.</p>
<p>You should be able to upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Professional using your Windows 7 Pro key by simply entering it in the Anytime Upgrade wizard in Windows 7 Home Premium. If that is not working, you probably might need to backup and
 do a clean install.</p>
<p>As for connecting to the HTPC running Windows 7 Professional, that should be possible by installing the Remote Desktop Client on the Windows 7 Home Premium systems:</p>

<h2>            ARE THE PEOPLE AT MICROSOFT IDIOTS--UPDATES SHOULDN&#39;T HAPPEN DURING A PRESENTATION</h2>
                    <p>My FIRST complaint is that there is no way to tell Microsoft about this idiotic product.&nbsp; I upgraded to windows 10 on my laptop with the idea of testing it out.&nbsp; I am finding multiple problems.&nbsp; But, I would have preferred to know, in advance, two things:&nbsp;
 (1) you can't go back to Windows 8.1 after 30 days and (2) windows 10 doesn't let you stop it from updating itself at any time.&nbsp; One of the main reasons that people use laptops, versus a desktop, is that you want to be able to pull out your computer and instantly
 become productive.&nbsp; While not everyone uses their laptop from presentations like I do, they should have considered that concept.&nbsp; I had my laptop set to wait until I give it permission to install updates under the old operating system.&nbsp; The main reason for
 that is what happened in this situation.&nbsp; I was literally one minute away from presenting to a group of lawyers (about 30 people) with a complicated Prezi presentation (thank God I wasn't using another Microsoft product such as Power Point to do this) when
 I look up and find that the system decided, without asking, to update itself.&nbsp; I proceeded to download its updates over my hotspot (I set it up so I would be able to have unfettered access to the internet rather than sharing the site's internet with the attendees)
 for the next 45 minutes and installing them with a blank screen showing only its very slow progress.&nbsp; My presentation was only an hour long and during this time, my laptop was completely useless.&nbsp; Luckily, this wasn't a court presentation to a jury.&nbsp; But,
 I'm wandering what idiot thought of this.&nbsp; Since you can't know in advance when updates are going to be released, this essentially means you can NEVER reliably use windows 10 on a laptop for presentation purposes, especially not a Power Point presentation
 which would require you to have the program and the presentation on the laptop that you wouldn't have access to once the unannounced update starts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if anyone has access to one of the software engineers, let them know that they really screwed that one up and in the future they should use focus groups before deciding on mandatory features.&nbsp; This version of the OS system is worlds of magnitude
 worst than Vista.&nbsp; They should have kept it.</p>

            <p>Thank you for saying it. I am trying to get over the fact that such idiotic decisions can happen so systematically. &nbsp;Is it too difficult to understand not everybody has great bandwidth all the time and that there might be more important things people would
 like to do than download updates ALL the time? This feature has rendered my laptop practically useless. I can get no work done in it because it is downloading updates on all the bandwidth I have all the time.</p>
<p>Which idiot decided this needs to be a mandatory feature!</p>

            I completely agree. My laptop began "upgrading" itself to Windows 10 without my permission too, and although I was fortunate enough to not require it for that day it became a nuisance afterwards when I found myself unable to use my laptop for anything
 other than chrome afterwards. For an entire month my laptop would not allow me to shut it down or force a shutdown, run any apps other than chrome, find settings, restart the machine, adjust the volume settings, watch dvds, etc. I cannot remember how I fixed
 my device to be slightly more usable after that but one thing I'm sure of is that I wasted at least two hours of today alone simply waiting for certain features to load or not lag because my laptop is still nowhere near to being as good or effective as it
 once was. I miss Windows 8 but can't convince my laptop to behave long enough for me to figure out how to get it back.&nbsp;

<h2>            Cannot make Windows 8 Recovery Disk</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading Win7 with final Win8-pro .iso-file, I made a systembackup (WindowsImageBackup) with the Window 7 File Recovery tool. No problem with that. Right after this backing-up, system asked if I would make a Recovery (Repair) Disk.
 When I tried to make this Recovery Disk I got following error message:</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!<br />
You've reached the right forum for your question. As I understand, you cannot make the Windows 8 recovery disk. I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps to check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>Recovery disk option is not available in Windows 8.You may use File history and external hard drive as a recovery drive:</div>
<div>File History automatically backs up files that are in your libraries, contacts, favorites,
<span>Microsoft SkyDrive</span> and on your desktop. If the originals are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore all of them.<br />
An external drive or network location to help protect your files against a crash or other PC problem</div>
<div>Refer these links:<br />

            <p>With regards to Windows 8 recovery disk, I have made the recovery disk for both of my PC,s , 1 being an upgrade from XP to 8 pro and the other new with 8 pre-installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You go to Control panel, type Recovery and select " Create A Recovery Drive " and follow the on screen instructions.</p>
<p>The only issue I had was that the Disk has to be in the drive before selecting Create because I was getting an error message not the normal " No disk found-please insert " as was the usual .</p>

            I find what Shivj says is correct. I've tried all advice in making a system repair disc since upgrading from W.7 to W.8 Pro. Nothing works. However I try to do it, the following message comes up:<br />
<br />
<i>The files needed to create a repair disc were not found on this computer. You can still create a system repair disc if you have a Windows installation disc.</i><br />
<br />
I don't have a Windows installation disc. Perhaps if I'd opted to download the upgrade to a disk and then installed from that, instead of just upgrading straight to the computer, it would be OK. Could that be the difference between those who can create a disk
 and those who cannot?<br />
<br />
If I go into the 'Advanced startup options' and click 'Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options', there are no further options for;<br />
<br />
* System Restore<br />
* System Image Recovery<br />
* Automatic Repair<br />
* Command Prompt<br />
<br />
There is only the 'Startup Settings' square showing. It was this that led me to trying to make a system repair disk. I thought it might be possible to access the missing options that way.<br />
<br />
So I am not able to get to a previously made WindowsImageBackup folder created in Windows 8. The startup disc made for Windows 7 will not find the the W.8 image.<br />
<br />
It's looking as if a third-party program will have to be used for imaging ..unless there is something else I can try to make it possible to use an image made by W.8.<br />

<p>
</p><p>It appears from the post above that there is no way I can make a bootable disk from which to restore my system image (ISO) that I just made with no problem from the File History-&gt;Create System Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make a bootable disk so I can restore from my system image in case of disaster? This seems to be a bizarre limitation&nbsp;since I can currently boot my PC and have a valid product key, but some files are "missing" (obviously all the files to boot exist,
 duh) which prevents me from making a "System Repair Disc".</p>
<p>Note that I don't care about repairing, but just being able to boot and restore my system image that Windows does allow me to create.</p>

    <title>Making Windows Media Player 64 bit default - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Making Windows Media Player 64 bit default</h2>
                    I have a windows 7 laptop that runs on a 64 bit processor, however i realised that the media player on the taskbar is the 32 bit one. I wanted to change it to runs the 64 bit one. So, i changed the destination of the shortcut to open the 64 bit player.
 However, this causes a new media player icon to come up, and when i right click, none of the normal shortcuts such as, recently played songs, recent songs, or tasks, comes up. Is there anyway to make the 64 bit version the default?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            I was able to make the WMP 64 bits, the default player, just right click in every file extension you want to open with it, for example, an .mp3 file, select open with-&gt;choose default program....-&gt;browse-&gt;&nbsp; select the WPM.exe located in the route we already
 know, and last, select "Always use this program...." finally Ok, that should work, hope it helps.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One Netzwerkprobleme NAT Typ Strikt</h2>
                    
<p>Heyho Forum,</p>
<p>habe seit ein paar Tagen nen Problem mit meinem Netzwerk.</p>

<p>Ich spiele über den Huawei R215 bzw. E5372, dies ist ein mobiler Hotspot von Vodafone(R215)/Huawei(E5372).</p>
<p>Bis dato gab es auch nie Probleme musste vorher nichtmal Ports freigeben... garnichts...</p>

<p>Nun seit 2-3 Tagen hängt die Verbindung, sobald ich jemanden in eine Party einlade dauert es nen paar Sekunden/Minuten bis mir am unteren Bildschirmrand angezeigt wird "Einladung versendet".</p>
<p>Aber es funktioniert nicht, ebenfals wenn ich eingeladen werde und annehme erhalte ich nur die Mitteilung das ein Netzwerkproblem auftritt mit Fehlercodes 0x800C00B und ähnliche....</p>
<p><br />
Vorhin kam ich 1x in die Party rein, aber es konnte keine Verbindung hergestellt werde.</p>

<p>Folgende Schritte habe ich bereits durchgeführt:</p>
<p>- IPv4 umgestellt. Standard Routereinstellung(nach Reset und Co) ist IPv4 &amp; IPv6, hatte damit nie Probleme XBOX Support sagte mal nur auf IPv4 stellen.</p>

<p>Dennoch steht bei Primärer DNS ein Code fe80::f6dc:XXXX:XXXX:XXXXXX</p>
<p>- Ports sind alle nötigen freigeben... Habe über das XOne Menü-&gt; Erweiterte Einstellungen meiner XOne ne IP zugewiesen : 192.168.0.100</p>
<p>danach die Ports freigeben:</p>

<p><br />
- dann habe ich im anderen Forum gelesen, dass man im Bezug auf IPv... des WPA umstellen kann/muss</p>
<p>Folgend habe ich des WPA2 auf WPA gestellt.</p>



<p>Wie gesagt hatte ich nie Probleme mit dem mobilen Hotspot, die 4G/LTE reichen alle mal zum zocken ;-)</p>
<p>Problemlösungen durchgeführt: IPv4 eingestellt, Ports freigegeben, WPA geändert</p>
<p>Habe auch mal probiert NAT ausschalten, ergab keine Änderung...</p>

<p>NAT Typ bleibt auf Stirkt</p>
<p>verzögerung beim Senden von Einladungen bleibt</p>
<p>Partyfehler bleibt....</p>

<p>Nachrichten kann ich ohne Probleme senden....</p>
<p>Online spielen geht meistens auch....</p>

<p>Abschließend kommt dazu, dass ich mit einigen Freunden nicht Verbinden kann sprich als beispiel Fifa16 oder NHL16 kein VS/Freundschaftspiel machen kann....</p>
<p><br />
Bei mir zuhause mit der Easybox von Vodafone funktioniert alles einwand frei, beim Hotspot ging es vorher ebenfals</p>

<p>Hoffe das mir einer von euch helfen kann..</p>

<p>Gruß Dennis</p>

            <p>Da du bei den meisten mobilen Hotspots komplett auf die Willkür der Provider ausgeliefert bist - bleibt dir leider nicht viel bis darauf zu achten das der Empfang entsprechend gut ist.</p>
<p>Alternativ könntest du es mal beim Provider ausprobieren.</p>
<p>Hintergrund ist das du bis auf Wlan-Sicherheitseinstellungen (grade bei Brandings) nichts einstellen kannst - Maximal noch eine feste IP-Adresse, was aber auch nichts bei dem Problem ändern sollte.</p>

<p>Eventuell hat Vodafone dann was umgestellt, und denen sind die IPv4 Adressen in Deinem Bereich "ausgegangen", und die machen CG-NAT, was Dich hinter ein doppeltes NAT steckt.
</p>
<p>Dann ist es Wurscht, wie Du die Ports freigibst. An den "großen" Router im Vodafone Rechenzentrum kommst Du nicht ran.

<p>Laut meinem gefährlichen Halbwissen ist die Xbox One eine IPv6 bevorzugende Konsole. Die Datenpakete werden, falls kein IPv6 verfügbar ist, über Teredo "Hilfs-Server" zu Not dann via IPv4 getunnelt.</p>

<p>Wie sieht es denn mit dem NAT bei Deinen Freunden aus? Vielleicht ist bei denen auch was umgestellt worden, und die haben nun auch ein nicht-offenes NAT, was eben zu mehr Problemen führt.</p>
<p>[quote user="xBlakox"]Bei mir zuhause mit der Easybox von Vodafone funktioniert alles einwand frei, beim Hotspot ging es vorher ebenfals[/quote]</p>
<p>Wie oben gesagt: Vielleicht hat Vodafone beim Mobilfunk jetzt auf CG-NAT umgestellt.</p>

 start up the game again and start where I left off but I opened it up and it gave me some sort of error saying it couldn't sync my data or something, I ended up losing all of saves since Sunday which is ridiculous because I've been playing this game and saving
 it every day this week. I'm super frustrated as you can imagine, I've tried removing my account and downloading it again. Nothing helps... Just wondering if there is anyway to fix this or is all my progress this week just gone.</span>

    <title>Error code&#58; 1053 when trying to stop BITS and unable to perform - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error code&#58; 1053 when trying to stop BITS and unable to perform Windows Updates.</h2>
                    <p>Windows update - bits service problem</p>
<p>On my HP desktop I tried to do a Windows update in the HP support assistant, and it just keeps gathering information, but never does anything else. Online I learned where to go on my pc to fix Windows update. I went to control panel, system and security,
 find and fix problems, fix problems with windows update. I used the help box that popped up, and when it got to the part about turning on the bits service, it hung there and never moved on. I looked online and found how to get to that service, and what it
 is about, and how to stop it and start it. When I tried to stop it, because it was on, I got an 1053 error message. From this, I just gave up. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            I have a V Gear DV pro capture card i can see video but not hear sound.</h2>
                    I have a V Gear DV pro capture card and use Corel video studio Pro x3 as capture software, windows works with the video chip on the capture card but not the audio chip, ( I can see video but cannot hear sound) and the card manufacture has gone so i cannot
 get a new driver for the card, also Video studio pro X3 wont let me choose another input for the sound i.e. sound-blaster card, my question is, is there a work around for this situation?<br />

</font></span></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></font></span></span><span>Is the audio issue confined to this capture software?</span></font></p>

</span></font></span></span><span>Is the sound working fine in the computer?</span></font></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">As the capture software is not allowing you to choose another input for the sound,
 we will first try to reinstall the software and check the status. If this does not help then we will reinstall the audio drivers and check the status.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Method 1.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">You may uninstall this software by follow the steps from this article. You can
 use Programs and Features to uninstall programs or to change a program's configuration by adding or removing certain options.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Uninstall or change a program:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If you have a disc for the software, then you may use the disc to reinstall the
 software.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If you do not have a disc, then you may download the software from this link:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Method 2.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">You may also try to reinstall or update the driver for your sound card. To do
 this, you need to visit the computer manufacturer's website. Most computer manufacturers have a special section on their websites for downloading drivers.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">For Windows to recognize your sound card or sound processor, you need a compatible
 driver. Most sound cards and sound processors require driver software to work properly. Outdated, incompatible, or damaged sound card drivers can disrupt communication between the computer and the sound card.</font></span></p>

            Thanks for the response, the sound is working fine from the soundblaster card to the speakers, and if i plug in the VCR audio to the line in on the soundblaster card i can hear the sound from the video im trying to capture, the problem is that I can not
 choose any other source for the audio input in the video studio Pro X3 program other than my capture card, and window 7 will not work with the driver (I have the disk that came with the capture card) for the audio chip on my video capture card. I have trying
 UN-installing and re-installing the driver and&nbsp; it is still is a fail :( and the manufacture, well I cannot find, I have read they went of of business and I cannot find a driver to make window 7 work with the audio chip on my V Gear DV Pro video capture card.<br />

    <title>All my X1 achievements have gone from my gamerscore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blood inside  say:</h3>
<h2>            All my X1 achievements have gone from my gamerscore</h2>
                    
<p>This evening all my gamerscore for x1 games has disappeared. Last night I had 173000 . Now I have 152290.</p>
<p>Upon checking on xbox 360, it now says I only have 85 gs for xbox one, so the value gone is pretty much all 21000 of my x1 gs.</p>
<p>On the xbox one console, random games still show their progress percentage, whilst others like Forza 5 and Ryse say 0% &nbsp;and 0/0 complete. If you go into their achievement tiles, my progress is still there and the ones I've unlocked show as unlocked, but
 the game still insists it 0% in the menus. Other games, like Watch Dogs, still show all my progress. However, this all makes little sense as I have lost the value of pretty much all my xbox one gamerscore.</p>
<p>On xbox.com it shows incorrectly as 152290, yet my little forum badge to the left still says 173000 (at least at the time of posting anyway). &nbsp;The games my console insists are 0% don't even show up as me ever having played them on xbox.com</p>
<p>I really hope this is something server side that can be sorted out.</p>
<p>Yes, I have hard reset , that was the only thing xbox twitter could come up with, which frankly was of no help.</p>
<p>Am on the latest build of the preview 1408, wired connection.</p>

<p>I earned two achievements on x360 last night and they show as complete in the individual titles achievements yet when looked from a list of games it still says 74 of 76 unlocked instead of 76 of 76. So this morning I redownloaded my profile and lost 7355
 (my xbox one gamerscore) on x360 and gained 75 from the 2 achievements, even though they still show 74 of 76 unlocked. Very whacky. Tweeted xbox support and got told xbox one gamerscore doesn't add to your xbox 360 gamerscore which is... very wrong and it
 has every day before now... something very off at xbox at the moment :(</p>

<p>I can see your Xbox One achievements on the website, Blood Inside. 75 on NFS, 445 on Sniper Elite, etc. So they're still there somewhere on the system, and are hopefully recoverable!</p>

<p>Yeah a few random titles still show, but a lot don't. The value that has gone off my GS is seemingly out of sync and no relation. To the achievements. For instance I have 1400 in Titanfall and several hundred in dead rising 3 and Forza 5 but they are all
 glitched at zero and don't even show on xbox.com :/</p>

            Sharing is done through the Home setting on the console. If the gold/game pass is under your son's account, he would need to set your console as his Home console.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox</a>

            If we did that then we would have to switch home console when he wanted to use it? I thought adding family members to the account allowed sharing of our membership without all that. Thanks

<p>You wouldn't have to keep switching it. Once he sets your console as his Home you can access his games and gold without his account. He can continue to use them as long as he signs in on his console. The only issue would be if other accounts would be sharing
 your son's console. Then his would need to remain his Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The family account basically allows you to set restrictions and settings on the other accounts in your family. It really has no effect on licenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is the Subscriptions under his account or your account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what console a profile is signed into it will ALWAYS be able to use their subscriptions and play their digital games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if the Subs are under your sons account. He would have to set the console that you are trying to play on as his profiles home console then you would be able to use the gold and game pass and still when he is signed in on his account no matter which console
 he would be able to use the subs. You would only be able to use the subs on the console your son has set as home console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that you can only switch which console you have set as the home console for a profile FIVE times a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The home console setting allows anyone else on that console to use the subscriptions of that profile and play any digital game that they own on that ONE console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only set one console as home at a time.</p>

            The amount of "memory" (RAM) used changes depending on what is running.&nbsp; If you open Task Manager (CTRL+ALT+DEL) and click on the "Performance" tab, the section under "Physical Memory" shows the total amount of RAM installed and how much is available at
 any given instant (by default, the numbers are updated every 2 seconds).<br />

Defrag shows free space on the hard disk.<br />
<br />
It does not show how much RAM is being used...<br />

            Thanks LemP. I tried what you said and it told me I have a total RAM of a little over a million; 140,000 available; and a system cache of 220,000. Do these numbers sound right? The interesting thing to me was the CPU usage bar graph: it cycles back and
 forth between 100%and 0% about every 30 seconds. Is that normal?<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking is I'm on Amazon.com sometimes, I'm a Prime Member (which means I can downstream their "Instant Videos") and watch them -- thousands of them, they say -- old TV series, movies, and such) but a lot of times when I do it, the video is all
 choppy and disjointed. The audio portion is usually fine.<br />
<br />
Charter Cable (my ISP) blames the problem on Amazon -- saying they're swamped and their buffering and streaming capabilities are being overpowered (especially at peak times, when everyon's home from work using their computers). Meanwhile, Amazon blames Charter,
 saying they're not&nbsp; providing enough signal speed -- but one of Charter's "speed tests" said I was getting 18.5 Mbps of download speed and 3.1 Mbps of upload speed. That's pretty fast, right? So, if they're BOTH telling the truth, then could it be something
 in my computer, or its memory capacity and usage that I described earlier that could be the problem after all?&nbsp;

            Make the combination alt+ctrl+del on your keyboard to access the task manager and click on the performance tab to see your memory usage and available memory left.<br />

Plus, you could get TuneUp utilities(It adds more style check your systems status)<br />

            If you have a Gigabyte of RAM -- and you do -- you should be OK for most normal uses on a Windows XP machine ... but it does depend on what is running on the computer.<br />
<br />
If you have 18.5 Mbps download capacity, that should be enough to stream videos without problems ... but one of the things about cable Internet services is that the overall capacity of the cable connection is shared among many subscribers.&nbsp; This makes your
 cable connection susceptible to exactly the same thing that Charter claimed was affecting Amazon:&nbsp; it slows down at peak times, when everyone's home from work using their computers.&nbsp; If you live in a market where Verizon FiOS is competing with a cable internet
 service, you'll have heard this argument in Verizon's commercials.&nbsp; Thus, it's important to do that speed test at close to the same time that you experience video streaming problems (but not simultaneously with watching the video).<br />
<br />
What's more suggestive of your problems is not the RAM usage but the CPU usage.&nbsp; If the CPU usage is spending any significant time at 100%, you have a problem, but I don't think the amount of physical RAM is the cause.&nbsp; When the CPU usage hits 100%, what process
 is taking the most? (Look on Task Manager's Processes tab and click the "CPU" at the top of the column twice to sort the entries).<br />
<br />
What are the specs for the CPU of your computer?&nbsp; Right-click My Computer and select Properties. The information is at the lower right.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://www.staysafeontheinternet.com/images/antivirus/xpsysprop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.staysafeontheinternet.com/images/antivirus/xpsysprop.jpg</a>&nbsp; While you're there, what version of Windows are you using, including service pack (that's the upper circle
 in the image)?<br />
<br />
Go back to the Task Manager Performance tab and look at the section on the left under "Commit Charge."&nbsp; Do this after you have been watching a video.&nbsp; Here is the relevant part of the page I suggested you read:
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Total Commit Charge exceeds the Total Physical Memory, XP has to use the virtual memory page file that is substantially slower than physical memory, suffering performance degradation as a result. One excellent reason
 to load the system with RAM.<br />
<br />
</li><li>
<p>Compare the Commit Charge Peak to the Physical Memory Total. If the Commit Charge peak is higher than the Physical Memory Total, not only is the page file being used, but the System Cache is not being used. Keeping
 the installed RAM well above the average Commit Charge peak allows XP to use the extra RAM for System Cache.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keeping the Commit Charge Peak running well below the Total Physical Memory allows you to decrease the size of the page file, reclaiming hard drive real estate that can be used for storage rather than slow virtual
 memory.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>What is your Commit Charge Peak, and how does it compare to your 1 Gigabyte Total Physical Memory?&nbsp; If you are using the virtual memory page file a lot, that would explain both the 100% CPU spikes and the poor video quality.<br />
</p>
<p>You also may have other things running on your computer that are causing the slowdown.&nbsp; This can be from overly-intrusive "security" software (what are you running as an antivirus application?) to too many "add-on" applications running in the background
 to malware.&nbsp; I suggest closing all other applications when you are watching videos.&nbsp; And on general principles, download, install, update, and run scans with each of the following tools.&nbsp; The scans will take a while, so start one up and go do a non-computer
 chore.&nbsp; I suggest scanning with these about once a week or so -- after updating.</p>

<p><a href="http://superantispyware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUPERAntiSpyware</a></p>
<p>Finally, you can "tune" your Internet connection.&nbsp; This is not the same as using programs that claim to speed up your computer.&nbsp; I strongly suggest that you don't use any of them, and certainly do not ever run an application that wants to "clean" or "optimize"
 your registry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just a few thoughts...maybe some of the following&nbsp;info will be useful...<br />
<br />
First...if you are seeing fluctuations in CPU usage from 0 to 100% <br />
every 30 seconds when no programs are supposed to be in use...<br />
I would have to wonder if your system was infected with some type <br />
of malware. <br />
<br />
Running programs like Malwarebytes and SuperAntiSpyware may <br />
be worth a try. <br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a><br />
<br />
SuperAntiSpyware<br />
<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
Do you encounter the same issues when viewing clips on YouTube?<br />
<br />
There are any number of things that can contribute to excessive<br />
buffering when viewing online video..<br />
<br />
IMHO...the number one cause would be a slow internet connection<br />
speed. But...18.5 Mbps download speed should be more than adequate.<br />
<br />
Maybe the following SpeedTest would be worth a try:<br />
<br />
Speakeasy Speed Test<br />
<a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/</a><br />
<br />
If you run the test several times choosing different locations you<br />
may see huge fluctuations in the download speed.<br />
<br />
Also high traffic on the servers, net congestion, and in some cases<br />
the servers may be half way around the world.<br />
<br />
Keeping your system fully updated and maintained can help...<br />
Excessive temp files can slow things down. Deleting Temporary<br />
Internet Files regularly can make a difference. (I delete mine at<br />
least once daily and if I'm doing lots of surfing more than once<br />
daily)<br />
<br />
The following maintenance tasks can improve performance:<br />

</a>The freeware CCleaner can be useful for quickly deleting Temporary<br />
Internet Files. I use it every day for deleting temporary internet files,<br />
cookies, emptying the recycle bin, etc...<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />

Avoid the Registry cleaner unless you understand 'exactly' what is being<br />
deleted. Removing the wrong file from the Registry can cause serious<br />
system problems.<br />
<br />
Most experts seem to agree that removing left over entries from the<br />
Registry won't improve computer performance anyway.</p>

            I have loaded and unloaded the epson software multiple times and worked with both epson technical support and windows support,all to no avail. I have also tried using different usb ports. No success. Windows technical support suggests an Epson issue and
 also suggested I buy a new computer. Epson says it is a microsoft problem. I can use the scanner when I go to the device and start the scan so I know that the Windows scanner software recognizes the scanner. I have noticed that when I looked at the driver
 details under the device I see that it appears to have loaded 32 bit drvier files. My computer is running 64 bits. Is this an issue?

<p>The scanner should be compatible with Windows 7. It was designed for 7 and up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you update on the Epson website, you pick 64-bit, don't you? There should be no problem. A 64-bit system can run 32-bit apps but 32-bit cannot run 64-bit apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried installing using compatibility option? Locate the driver here:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository</span></p>
<p><span>Even though the scanner was designed for Windows 7 and up, give compatibility mode a try.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I removed all the Epson files from my computer. I downloaded the Scan utility accessed the file and changed the compatibility settings to show windows 7 and installed the file. I did this as well for the Event manager and the copy utility. I connected the
 scanner and turned it on. The driver for the scanner was installed and showed no errors. When I tried the scan utility it still shows windows has stopped stopped working. The hardware buttons on the scanner do not work either!!</p>

<p>i am having a problem with my bluetooth connection on my dell e5500 laptop, i cant locate the correct page to check on the bluetooth adaptors settings, i have tried to download the latest driver, but it is telling me there is nothing to download, which seems
 to suggest that i already have the latest driver,also the bluetooth symbol led is lit on the laptop, which i guess means that it is enabled, have tried to connect my mobile phone to my laptop but have been unsuccessful so far, has anyone experienced this before
 and if so would you have to knowledge to guide me through where i am going wrong many thanks roger&nbsp;</p>
