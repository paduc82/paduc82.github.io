<h2>            How to Install Windows 7 on SSD drive</h2>
                    This is a complex topic:
<div>I have a laptop that I bought new with Vista several years ago. Now I have upgraded it with W7 (upgrade version). Apart from it refusing to install on the C-drive because of not enough space it has worked fine (I installed it one the D-drive).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I'm thinking about buying a SSD harddrive, replacing my old harddrive, and reinstalling from scratch. But will this work? I undertand there are differences between upgrade and full? It's the same laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really need my computer so this has to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Jorgen</div>

<p>Clean Install Windows 7 With Upgrade Media and Product Key on Formatted or Empty Blank Hard Drive<br />
<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/10/27/clean-install-windows-7-with-upgrade-media-and-product-key-on-formatted-or-empty-blank-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/10/27/clean-install-windows-7-with-upgrade-media-and-product-key-on-formatted-or-empty-blank-hard-drive/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read the following:<br />
The upgrade will check that (Windows XP or Vista) is installed. <br />
However the Windows 7 End User License Agreement does specifically state that, therefore as long as you have a valid COA<br />
and product key for the computer you wish to upgrade you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if your computer came with a previous qualifying license (Vista or Windows XP). Note: The Certificate of Authencity (COA) must be attached to the computer and readable, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------- License -------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade.<br />
Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from.<br />
After you upgrade, you may no longer use the software you upgraded from."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16.PROOF OF LICENSE.<br />
a.Genuine Proof of License. If you acquired the software on a disc or other media, your proof of license is the genuine Microsoft certificate of authenticity label with the accompanying genuine product key, and your proof of purchase. If you purchased and downloaded
 the software online, your proof of license is the genuine Microsoft product key for the software which you received with your purchase, and your proof of purchase from an authorized electronic supplier of genuine Microsoft software. Proof of purchase may be
 subject to verification by your merchant’s records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------------- <strong>Phone Activation is required</strong>&nbsp; ------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 or Vista manually (activate by phone)<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
5) Stay on the phone <strong>(do not select/press any options) </strong>and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
6) <strong>Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />
</strong>7) The support person should give you a confirmation ID, copy it down on paper,
<br />
8) Verify the ID is correct by reading back to the support person.<br />

            <p>If your computer came with a previous qualifying license such as Windows Vista or Windows XP and the Certificate of Authencity is still attached to the machine in good condition, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk.</p>
<p>How to do a clean install with the upgrade disk:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

            Hi Kristen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible fixes that are working for others for webcam problems.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by to help.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try also these steps from Microsoft for when webcam isn't working:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/windows-10-camera-does-not-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the HP Support Downloads webpage here <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a> for your exact model or Serial Number.     
<br />
<br />To locate the driver in Device Manager (accessed by right clicking the Start Button) choose the View tab &gt; Show Hidden Devices.
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then you can roll it in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer Stops Responding, Freezes Computer</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I just bought a brand new laptop several days ago and I've been having problems with Windows Photo Viewer. I use daily it to read comics on my computer and I've noticed that it frequently stops responding during use. Once the window locks up, if I
 try to close it, the other programs I'm using will also quit responding and I have to hold the power button on my laptop to manually shut it down.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated and I am running the 64-bit version of Windows 7, thank you!</p>

<h2>            Sorround sound in &#34;Movies &#38; TV&#34; Application</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if there is any options to select audio in the application "Movies &amp; TV", I just bought "Big hero 6" to test this and I am not getting any surround sounds through this application. In the Store it states "Dolby Digital" Audio, but my Pioneer
 (SCLX77) does not get any info about this and ends up playing in Stereo, or DD Pro Logic/ DTS Neo X, which is Stereo upscaled to 5.1 channels.</p>
<p>When I play another file on my PC, which has DD, and running it through "Movies &amp; TV" I get no sounds, but when I run it in Media Player Classic Home Cinema it streams the correct audio information to my HT-System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is there so few options in "Movies &amp; TV" to enable the sound track you should have, and why can't it stream DD/DTS audio?</p>
<p>Is this a bug or intended, because the Movie/TV part of the store should be changed then to not sell Dolby Digital Audio, as this does not seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any reason for this? My system works fine in all other media player programs, but not the built in app...</p>
<p>This is the reality on 3 different setups:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 3 (i5/256GB/8GB ram/Windows 10 Pro)</p>
<p>My HTPC (Asus VIVO i5/120GB/8GB ram/Nvidia + Intel GFX/Windows 10 Home)</p>
<p>My Gamer PC (i7/32GB ram/GTX 980/Windows 10 Pro)</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue with the Netflix App. Before upgrading from 8.1 to 10 the HDMI audio would output the Dolby Digital + (5.1) when selected on Netflix. Now, it only outputs PCM stereo only.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HDMI audio is Nvida, I haven't tested my Realtek Digital audio (optical) to see if it has the same issue as well and will update when I do.

            This post was not helpful there is a serious issue with the sound in the new "Movies and TV" app there is no sound while sound works for every other program. My boyfriend who is very familiar with OS's including taking&nbsp;OS classes and doing some MS development
 went through all of these steps but still the video we paid for will not play sound. Note MS Groove witch is also a new win 10 app plays sound fine.

Choose your langugae settings, and then click next<br />3. Click "repair your computer."<br /><br /><strong>Status: 0xc000000e<br />Info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible.</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an enjoyable nine months of perfectly tranquil Windows 7 Ultimate being used as my Desktop OS. I know find I am stuck with welll this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I run a startup repair from my Win 7 installation disc every thing configures fine and dandy. The machine performs a reset and commences to take an inordinant time to reload the supposedly stable OS (213sec) of course once the desktop loads I'm then confronted
 with Windows 'Installing a new system driver'.</p>
<p>I can't even find out what this driver is as my entire OS freezes me out for nine minutes approx upon reboot I'm once again blessed with my glorious Status error.</p>

<p>Hi darklight,</p>
<p>What is your computer brand and model?</p>
<p>I suggest removing all peripherals from the computer (except mouse, keyboard, and monitor) and booting to see if the issue resolves.</p>
<p>If it does, you can add the hardware back a piece at a time to see whats failing.</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, you might visit the computer manufacturers website and download the latest<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">chipset</a> driver.</p>

    <title>How to undo Microsoft login credentials on my PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradyja  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to undo Microsoft login credentials on my PC</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded Windows 10 Pro on my Laptop and on my PC.&nbsp; My login credentials with the Laptop&nbsp;remained as they were before the Windows download.&nbsp; However, on my PC, instead of keeping the login I had prior to the Windows download, my login credentials
 were automatically changed to reflect the login for my Microsoft account.&nbsp; As a result, when&nbsp;I now create personal folders, new contacts and contact groups in Outlook on my Laptop ... this information is not reflected or updated&nbsp;in Outlook on my PC.&nbsp; And...
 I believe this is due to the&nbsp;2 computers reflecting&nbsp;login credentials for 2 different types of accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to cancel&nbsp;or undo the&nbsp;login credentials on my PC that are associated with the Microsoft account and&nbsp;create a regular username and password
 the is&nbsp;unrelated to&nbsp;the Microsoft account.&nbsp; Will someone please advise how this can be accomplished?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Are you in a gold family plan, but are not the primary account?</p>
<p>As far as I know starting the downloads here on xbox.com is a workaround. The family plan treats the accounts besides the primary as child accounts - it's a glitch in the system..</p>

<h2>            delete account in Outlook Express</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally started Outlook Express 6 on my computer (with my ATT account/password and now I lost all my inbox &nbsp;at my regular e-mail site. &nbsp;I did not want Outlook express. How do I delete it without losing everything?</p>
<p>When I accidentally clicked on Outlook Express wizard, I gave them my old account (yahoo) so I think I am duplicating everything by having it sent back and forth with Outlook Express being the main one. I also keep getting error messages about servers and
 Http Mail ports<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I remove this account am I going to remove all my e-mail because it is in the same name as my old one?<br />
</p>
<p>Could I just change my account name and password to Outlook Express?<br />

            <p>You can remove the mail account in OE&nbsp;via Tools | Accounts | Mail and highlight the account and remove it.&nbsp; It will not delete the messages from your local hard drive.</p>
<p>If you downloaded the messages off the ATT server and it was a POP3 account, then OE likely deleted them from the server after it downloaded them by default.&nbsp; I assume that is what you mean by saying you lost your inbox on your "regular" site.&nbsp; But they
 are still on the hard drive and you can access them in OE even after you remove the account.&nbsp;&nbsp; If its not a POP3 account, then you will have to explain more fully what is going on.</p>

<p>A moderator should split this thread and move the new poster's messages to&nbsp;its own&nbsp;thread in the XP forum if it's really about XP and OE.</p>
<p>If you delete the account in OE, the messages will remain in the folders, I believe, provided you do not remove the identity.&nbsp; You will find it difficult to get them back on the server, but if you configure an IMAP account, you should be able to move them
 back.&nbsp; See <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mobile/comms/mail/imap-01.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>There are multiple reports of Windows update not being able to connect to the Update server and other Microsoft services not being able to connect to the Internet. While this is being investigated, you can try changing the DNS and see if it resolves the
 issue for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the DNS, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key+R</strong> to open <strong>Run</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Type in <strong>ncpa.cpl</strong> and press Enter.</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> the device in the Network list through which you connect and choose
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Internet Protocol version 4 </strong>and <strong>choose properties</strong> just below the Checkbox list.</li><li>Select the radio button "Use the following DNS servers" and add the following values in the boxes:
<br />
<br />
<strong>8.8.8.8</strong><br />
<strong>8.8.4.4<br />
</strong></li><li>Press OK and Reboot your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p><em>[Update 2/1/19]</em></p>
<p>The issue has started to correct for those who are affected. It is expected to be fully fixed in the next 24 hours or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------------</p>
<p><em>[Added 2/5/19:]</em></p>
<p>You can try <strong>restarting the network router </strong>simply which should refresh the things if you do not want to change DNS in Windows.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi RRicci428,<br />
<br />
<br />
You can check the method on how to disable the CTF Loader by checking this <strong>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance-winpc/disable-ctfmonexe-win10/0c24a847-23e2-46e4-b8ca-381ebb663502">link</a></strong>. If you still encounter errors, I suggest that you get in
 touch with BlueStacks' developer. They can provide a better resolution how to properly install their software on your computer.<br />
<br />

<h2>            When it says &#34;Windows loading files&#34; should I wait&#63; Its been like that for 15 minutes now.</h2>
                    Hi there! I have a dell m5030 and have a problem with it. I have it for a year and 2 months and now I am running a problem with it. It had been working good until one day I turned it on and a "Startup repair" appeared. I just followed the instruction and
 my compute diagnose the problem but after a few minutes - it says "problem cannot be detetcted" and it freezes. I turned it off by taking out the battery and I put it back in and hit the power button - now, it says "windows loading files" &nbsp;and it has been
 like that for like 15 minutes now. Should I wait? Or should I assume it freezes? What could be the problem with my computer? Can I still fix it? Please advice me. Thank you.

            I had seen a previous answer of yours and tried each of them with no help.&nbsp; I also have uninstalled and installed Windows Store and that is when I did get the partial download of .10kb of 260kb and then I get the "unable to install at this time, will try
 again later."

<p>Thats slightly different</p>
<p>xbox one is region free as far as physical disks goes but not as far as dlc goes</p>
<p>as your beast option is still to create an xbox live account &nbsp;in your actual regiom</p>
<p>if you dont live in an xbox live region you wont be able to download dlc</p>
<p>Gta5 is confirmed as region locked due to international laws</p>
<p>international laws cannot be ignored </p>

<p>DLC's region locked = no problem,but Full Game Region Locked = that's the problem.</p>
<p>If they make xbox 360 region free atleast i can download the Full Game with no problem,as with DLC's i don't usually buy DLC's of any game.</p>

                    <p>I have Windows XP, IE8, SP3. A PC desktop.&nbsp;I get the same repeated error messages every time I start up windows. 1) Assert failed\projects\wtKernal\src\Win32\cm\Core\cmCodeModule.cpp:90m_CodeHandel!+NULL&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)- "The application failed to mitiolize( ? not
 sure of spelling) porperly (0X80000003). Click on ok to terminate the application."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I of coarse have no idea what application (I guess the error message tells that). I exit out repeatedly, and ok out of the second one repeatedly, then all seems well. But,
 apparently it isn't? I can go on to use the internet and all programs I've tried. I recently did a system recovery (not restore) if that helps, these messages weren't there at first. I had to, I thought, put SP2 and SP3 for IT professionals in to get updates,
 it worked. But it came with a dire sounding warning for home users with only one computer (as I have). Hmmm... What could it be? Thank you in advance!</p>

<p><b><span>Hi kinaZU, </span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Thank you for posting your query in the <b>Microsoft Community</b> Forums. If I understand you correctly, you receive an error code
</span>0X80000003 with an error message, “The application failed to initialize” on startup.
<span>I understand that it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help fix your issue and guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us start with a few questions-</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Apart from the <b>Startup</b>, does this error come up while
<b>using applications</b> as well?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made <b>any changes</b> on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like more information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us now perform some troubleshooting steps. All the steps are to be performed systematically and in an order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1 –</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1-</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You need to check if this issue persists in<b> Safe Mode with Networking.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">To start the computer in safe mode</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note<b>: </b>Make you get the computer back<b> </b>to<b> Normal</b> <b>Mode
</b>after performing all the troubleshooting steps<b>.</b></span></p>
<p><span>You need to select<b> “Safe Mode with Networking” </b>instead<b> </b>of<b> “Safe Mode”.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Proceed to <b>Step</b> 2 if, the issue does not persist in <b>Safe</b> <b>
Mode</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2-</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform a </span><span><strong>Clean Boot</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Placing your system in a </span><span><strong>Clean Boot</strong></span><strong> state</strong><span> helps in identifying if
</span><span>any third party applications or startup items are</span><span> causing the issue.

            <p>you do not necessarily need to run SFC as that is a program that runs in the background at need by the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can run checkdiskwith the /r parameter, if you can boot to safe mode, then uninstall either the last program you installed or the last driver you installed and see if that lets you boot normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you do not have the install cd, you can create a cd with the recovery console to run checkdisk, or you can create a cd with hiren's boot cd to run checkdisk as hiren's does not care if your hard drive is sata or ide, but recovery console does.</p>

            I still can't fix this problem or find anyone who can fix it. &nbsp;I called up Microsoft Technical support for "support" and as is the case in 90% of the phone calls to technical support, the call mysteriously dropped right in the middle of the conversation.
 &nbsp;End of call without solution. &nbsp;And the voice prompt system is so demoralizingly frustrating that I just gave up. &nbsp;It takes so long to reach someone and when you do, they hang up on you.

<h2>            Surface Book &#34;hover right click&#34; with the pen possible without additional &#34;tap&#34; on the screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with my pen that comes with the surface book. When I use the right click button of the pen nothing happens exept for a small circle that appears. It needs an additional "tap" with the pen on the screen to actually get a "right click" (and
 that messes up some short cuts I use in photoshop...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to use the right click button on my pen without the need of an additional "tap" with the pen on the screen. This is how it works on wacom tablets...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />
