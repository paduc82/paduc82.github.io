<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t load on Lenovo T410</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, thanks in advance for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 7 Lenovo T410 with a first gen (I think) i5 and a 300 gb Hitachi hard drive that won't turn on. I have it plugged in (it doesn't charge well, but I think that is the battery being ancient) and when I push the power buttons all the lights
 blink merrily away, but it only gives me the Lenovo logo screen and then changes to a black screen with the blinking line in the upper left corner (like normal windows 7) but it stays on that screen and won't load Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got to the BIOS with the blue Lenovo ThinkVantage and ran a diagnostic on the hard drive, it said it would take one minute per gigabyte, and it never got past 0% completed test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that my hard drive is toast, which isn't that big of a deal, it's backed up, and a new hard drive isn't too expensive, but I really do want to know if that is the real problem before I go buy a new hard drive!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... how do I tell for sure?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it did this once to me before, and I got it running after trying again, but I just thought it was out of date drivers. So, if I get it running again, what do I do?&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Okay, with the Hard disk drive diagnostics program accessed through the BIOS (I just ran it again, I think I just quit too soon last time) it says "Test complete" and the results were... "Pass: Controller Diag" and "Pass: Read verification and speed test".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There haven't been any heat problems that I can detect.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I gather this is a pretty old laptop.&nbsp; I would guess 7 or 8 years.&nbsp; Correct me if I am wrong please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would replace the hard drive because if it has not yet failed it is likely to be quite soon.&nbsp; Chances are you need to re-install Win7.&nbsp; Why do that on an old drive that is likely way past its prime?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the procedure I use:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The hard drive&nbsp;has failed.&nbsp; You will have to replace it.&nbsp; Replace with a 500 G or more rotating 7200rpm drive.&nbsp; 500G drives can be found for around $70.&nbsp; Typically quite easy to replace.&nbsp; Now you will need a complete Windows 7 install.</li><li>I do this all the time.&nbsp; I have done hundreds.&nbsp; This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</li><li>From this point onward, I am providing you with the process to install Windows 7.</li><li>You <strong>may </strong>be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the failing&nbsp;hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.&nbsp; You may need a friend to do this part for you, but the rest is not really
 very technical or difficult for most people.</li><li>Install the new hard drive.</li><li>Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers, unless you can not proceed further.</li><li>When you get to the place where it asks you where to put the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions.</li><li>When the installer asks about Windows update, choose Ask me later</li><li>Do NOT install any program</li><li>Hopefully, you started with a Win7 install disk that was SP1 (Service Pack 1). If not, run Windows Update until you get to the point that SP1 has installed itself as part of this procedure.&nbsp; It entails multiple Windows Update passes and restarts&nbsp;which you
 keep updating until you get there.</li><li>Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, install the following:</li><li><strong>KB3020369</strong> Win-7 32 <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 working and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>Keep running Windows Update again and again till it offers no new ones.</li><li>Start Internet Explorer, click the gear (upper right)&nbsp;in IE11 and select Compatibility settings and enter
<strong>Microsoft.com</strong> in the list</li><li>Start Windows Update and click the link to include updates for other Microsoft software.</li><li>Run Windows Update again and again until you are satisfied you have all the updates you want.</li><li>After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type <strong>device</strong> in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose Device manager from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; You should get
 drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have installed all of them or nearly. Do NOT use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install
 malware.</li><li>Install your Microsoft Office software and then run Windows Update again and again till no more are proposed.</li><li>Defragment your drive.&nbsp; Type <strong>defragment</strong> in the text box above the start globe when you click it once.&nbsp; Choose the Defragmentation link.&nbsp; Wait till it completes all passes..</li><li>Next, you will need to take steps to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.&nbsp; First step is to change the Windows Update setting to NEVER. Second step is to download and install GWX Control Panel.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>New install tip:</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<strong><em>before</em></strong> any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<strong><em>+</em></strong>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as
 it was at this point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the time you put in this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

            <p>Okay, yes it is old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing, I made a system image on DVD+R with a repair disk about a week ago (First time in my life I did something smart with a computer!). I don't have a Windows 7 install disk. If I read your post correctly, I will only need a Windows 7 install disk
 if I didn't have a system image and repair disk?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which steps can I skip since I have a system image?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I have the CHKDSK function running, and it is 72% complete. I actually got it to turn on. Somehow...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hate intermittent problems. Are you sure that the hard drive is toast? As you can tell by my using an ancient computer, I'm cheap and don't like to spend money, especially a $70.00 hard drive for a computer that should be less than $200! I really
 don't care too much about storage space, as far as I am concerned a 250 gb drive would be fine with me unless there is a different problem. Any reason for 500 gb?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, why the DVD+R as opposed to the DVD-R? I just went to walmart and purchased a stack of 50 +R disks because they were the same price as the -R and I figured + is better than -... Glad I picked the right one, but why?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Using an image made on a disk that may be failing is a bad procedure because the image will include a precise copy of all the disk errors on the failing drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If however, the disk is <strong>not </strong>yet failing, it is a good strategy.&nbsp; Technically, you can just ignore all that I listed.&nbsp; You may be able to start the computer using the F8 key and find an option to recover your computer from an image.&nbsp; If you
 can not find that using the F8 option, you will need a System Repair disk.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend you make one of those anyway.&nbsp; It is simple.&nbsp; You need a blank recordable CD or DVD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start globe (bottom left)</p>
<p>All programs</p>
<p>Maintenance</p>
<p>And there it is.&nbsp; Takes 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a System Repair disk, simply boot the system from that disk.&nbsp; You may need to press the F12 key on startup to get a boot list so that you select the DVD drive to boot from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then proceed to the part where it says recover your computer from an image.&nbsp; The rest is pretty simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, new computers these days are not $200.&nbsp; Try closer to at least $500 to $1000.&nbsp; A new disk drive is a pittance compared to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another advantage to a new disk is that you do not have to disturb anything on the current drive.&nbsp; Reduces risk and is much less scarier.</p>

            <p>Okay, my system image is from my failing drive, so it is basically useless in this new hard drive scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my system repair disk that I made at the same time also useless? Do I need to make another?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not exactly sure what is being suggested now, am I trying to repair the hard drive that I have, or am I trying to install my old system on a new hard drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the confusion, but I meant that my particular laptop (A Lenovo T410) when purchased used or "refurbished" should only be $200.00.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your help so far!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, what do you usually recommend for a "cache" or "buffer"? I got one that has 16 MB, although I saw a bunch with more. 500 GB, 7200 rpm, 3gb/s I understand, but have no idea what is "normal" for a cache. I simply lack a standard to compare
 to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, what is the difference between steps 19 and 21 in your above step-by-step tutorial? It will be a 64-bit version of 7.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you are going to replace the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) consider a Solid State Drive (SSD). Not only will this type of drive improve the performance of your computer (Boots faster and apps load quicker) and they are shock resistant so a bump while the laptop
 is running will not damage your SSD.</p>

</p><p>I tried the microsoft download site for the ISO files... and like many others complaining about it on the web... it didn't work. I could probably borrow a friend's disk and make one, but I figured $15 for a disk wasn't worth the issue... assuming the $15
 disk works...&nbsp;</p>

                    <div><span>My webcam stopped working on Hangouts but is till working on Cortana and some other apps. At first my HP 3110 webcam worked well at resolution of 720 p but
 something went wrong and Hangout stopped to accept the video but only sound. I plugged my webcam into the different USB port and the issue seemed to be fixed but the camera resolution dramatically decreased. However, before long the problem came up again and
 now it doesn’t transmit the signal on Hangouts at all</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Betty, 
<br />
<br />I’ve checked your webcam compatibility and found out that it cannot work with Windows 10 appropriately. Please follow the link HP HD-3110 Webcam
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-hd-3110-webcam/4172392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>
<br />When you on the website click on the Operating System and then the Version - you will see the operating systems compatible with the HP 3110 Webcam. 
<br />Anyway I recommend that you follow the link to the Webcam troubleshooting website
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03430151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03430151</a>
<br />Check the exact resolution of your webcam from the section Determine the resolution of the webcam
<br />Then go to Video does not display in your webcam software and do the troubleshooting steps.
<br />In case the issue is still there, refer to Reinstalling the original webcam software that came with your computer to reinstall the Webcam drivers.

<p>You can't download this file from Microsoft.&nbsp; If it is corrupt and SFC can't repair it you need to re-install Vista to fix the problem.</p>
<p><span>We'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you can't get your hands on the right disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can
 use Knoppix </span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>Idk for sure but I know here in Texas&amp;Florida Verizon sold to Frontier, so it could be Verizon switching everything over to Frontier. If your issues started 4/1 then that very well could be what it is since that's when the switch started.

<p>Verizon killed their TV app on Xbox and Smart TVs. &nbsp;Here's what I got from Verizon on March 17th:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On March 31, 2016, the&nbsp;<span>Fios</span><sup><span>®</span></sup>&nbsp;<span>TV</span>&nbsp;<span>app</span>&nbsp;you are using to watch your&nbsp;<span>Fios</span>&nbsp;<span>TV</span>&nbsp;programming through a Smart&nbsp;<span>TV</span>&nbsp;or an Xbox gaming
 system will be retired and will no longer be available for use. Sorry for the inconvenience.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But we have great news; you can watch your&nbsp;<span>Fios</span>&nbsp;<span>TV</span>&nbsp;content using our&nbsp;<span>Fios</span>&nbsp;Mobile&nbsp;<span>app</span>from your smartphone or tablet. This&nbsp;<span>app</span>&nbsp;allows you to stream&nbsp;<span>TV</span>&nbsp;content
 in and out of your home and so much more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you don’t already have the&nbsp;<span>app</span>, you can easily download it now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know it doesn't solve the problem, but hopefully it answers your question.</span></p>

 There is no start menu.. I can't open anything that would be on the hard drive...can't go to "This PC" or "Control Panel"..literally nothing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done anything, I am a novice so unless I know exactly what to do, I do nothing!</p>
<p>I have HP Desktop PC, with WIN 10.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I right click on the desktop background I get a dialog box that offers "personalize".. I click that and get a dialog box saying</p>
<p>"File does not have a program associated with it. Please install a program or if one already exists...create an association in the Default Program"</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened and how to I get it back? I am fearfully thinking I have lost my hard drive?</p>
<p>Only thing I can say is that I always saved things to an external hard drive, but...I can't access that since there is no option to do that!

    <title>Default Library location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papa84075  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Library location</h2>
                    How do I restore the libraries to their default location. I have tried bringing up properties on the default library folder and changing location to the default but it says it can't continue because the destination location already gas a folder by that
 name. Why doesn't it say that it has found one and do I want to overwrite the destination location with the copied info like other folders do? It is because the registry is involved at such a detailed level?

            As far as I can tell after looking at the Libraries is that the information is from other folders and that is where you need to make the changes.

            Thanks Greg, that gets what I needed.&nbsp; I guess my main concern is when I put things back as there are so many sub-directories on some folders is, will the registry reflect the change such that future installs will default to the new location as they should?

            Reinstalls will always set everything back to default location, as may sometimes in-place Upgrade installs done by version Updates.  So back up fully at all times.   Some tips here to consider:
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder in Onedrive using Folder protection, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I just realized upon looking closer that there is folder location called "Library" in the file manager, haven't looked at the whole article yet but does it cover restoring everything to it's default state?

<p>(Trying to start Teamspeak)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through some pretty intense google sprees I am fairly confident it is a problem with my Visual C++ Redistributable installation, so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, which consistently gets stuck on this screen:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know there has already been several discussions about this, but every solution I have tried has as of yet, had no effect on the outcome of trying to install &nbsp;the redistributable package.</p>
<p>Here's the log of a failed download, after I cancelled it when it was stuck:&nbsp;http://pastebin.com/VXZMiupH</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit problems with USB HID Logitech DiNovo Edge</h2>
                    <p>Since I am using Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit I have problems using the keyboard Logitech DiNovo Edge. Sometimes the device works after starting Windows, but sometimes after Windows start there is no reaction and I have to unplug the USB dongle and put it in again.
 The same I have with a Speedlink Xeox Wireless Gamepad. Strange is that it makes this problems with the USB 2.0 ports, and works with the USB 3.0 ports. But I have to use the devices on the USB 2.0 ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution?</p>

            <p>There is a setting that enables/disables sleep on USB ports. I had this problem on a Win7-64 bit PC and I suspect the solution is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't tell you exactly how to get to it in Win 10 as I'm in front of a Win8.1 box at the moment, but it's in Power Settings. You'll see a couple of options called "Preferred plans".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a link called "Change plan settings" next to the plans which takes you to a screen where you can modify the power plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that is a link to "Change advanced power settings" which open a dialog box. In the list, scroll to USB setting and open up the folder. You'll see an option called "USB selectivesuspend setting". Turn it off (disabled) and it should resolve the problem.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you very much for your response, however, that does not work. &nbsp;That setting is already turned off. &nbsp;I've tried turning it on and off again, rebooting and none of the options I've chosen work. &nbsp;I have Cortana turned off and everything else related to
 handwriting and still I get that panel. &nbsp;I would love, love, love to find a way to get rid of it. &nbsp;It truly is an annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your assistance.</p>

            <p>I have tried the same, and it did not work.&nbsp; I sincerely hope Microsoft will listen to the user on this.&nbsp; It is very irritating to have to make two extra taps toget up the proper keyboard every time you want to write something.</p>

            Please make Windows 10 remember the last keyboard method used. Having to switch from the handwriting input to onscreen keyboard every time I enter text is ridiculous.

            <p>So, I've solved my problem, though I suspect&nbsp; my solution is not what Microsoft had in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; This won't work for actual tablet users that are using the touch keyboard but not the handwriting panel.&nbsp; I am using a PC with a wacom and this solution turned
 off the handwriting panel that was so annoying. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>start </li><li>settings</li><li>search "services "</li><li>view local services </li><li>when the box pops up that shows&nbsp; all the services, look for the service labeled Touch keyboard and handwriting panel
</li><li>click on it and right click, change the setting to manual, then select stop to stop the service&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>you can start it again whenever you like </p>

            <strong>Here's a Quick Fix 2 hold you over </strong>until Microsoft Fixes it !!!<br />
All you have to do is <strong>open </strong>the&nbsp; "<strong>On-Screen Keyboard</strong>".
<br />
(This can be found using search or by going to the 'Ease of Access' section of the settings.)
<br />
Once its open you can slide it down to the bottom of the screen out of site, or set it to "Fade", or in a place of your choosing...
<br />
Now<strong> As long as this 'On-Screen Keyboard' is active, this stops the Handwriting Panel from popping up.&nbsp;
</strong><br />
***PROBLEM SOLVED** <br />
However it also stops the Touch keyboard from popping up as well.&nbsp; but if you are using a Wacom tablet then u probly also have a physical keyboard anyway.&nbsp;
<br />
[[P.S. I suggest 'pinning' this app to the taskbar', that way its always just a click away. Also u have the option to set the 'On-Screen Keyboard' to always start automatically when you start windows.]]
<br />
- i hope this helps you until Microsoft finally fixes this issue.&nbsp; <br />

<strong>...::: @Faazon :::... </strong></blockquote>
<p>Just in case there is confusion...I found "Fade" as key on the On-Screen Keyboard.&nbsp; There is also a NAV key that minimizes the keyboard to a simple strip with a few useful keys present -- this has the advantage of getting the whole thing out of the way.&nbsp;
 I am driven crazy by having the handwriting pad come up every time I ask for the keyboard from the keyboard icon that can be activated on the taskbar.&nbsp; I did already figure out to pin this On-Screen Keyboard app to the taskbar instead.&nbsp; But I couldn't figure
 out how to keep it up on my Surface 3 Pro without using significant screen space.&nbsp; The Fade key makes the keyboard fade to a "shadow".&nbsp; The NAV key minimizes it but leaves it visible and easy to access.&nbsp; There is also an Up and Down key that places the keyboard
 on top or on the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Thank you guys!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail-Error &#39;Your xxxx account settings are out of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uqfo93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail-Error &#39;Your xxxx account settings are out of date&#39; with the options &#39;fix account&#39; or &#39;dismiss&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 on my laptop and have been using the mail application for some time. &nbsp;I have two accounts on there a gmail account and another (my broadband supplier).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All was ok, I haven't changed anything - &nbsp;passwords, account settings, nothing at all - but a couple of days ago, every time the account went to sync (which is set at every 15 mins) I would get the following pop up notification for the non gmail account:
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Your xxxx account settings are out of date' with the options 'fix account' or 'dismiss'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly though, despite the warning, I can still send and receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix account option requires me to supply the password to the account, even though it hasn't changed, and doing this doesn't prevent the same message popping up a few minutes later, which is incredibly annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problems with the account on my mobile phone or tablet - neither of which are windows devices. &nbsp;Clearly it has to be a windows problem, presumably caused by the most recent update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched online and this seems to be an old problem with windows 10 for mobile devices. &nbsp;The only solution suggested is to inhibit the automatic time sync within the overall settings in the control panel. &nbsp;That doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My IT skills are not brilliant and all I can think of to do now is to delete and reinstall the account or delete and reinstall windows mail. &nbsp;Both of these involve losing all my sent items which will be a real pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            having EXACTLY the same problem with the mail app on my Windows 10 computer for my Office 365 account. &nbsp;I don't use the mail app as I use Outlook, but I agree that it is very annoying. &nbsp;Just ran the troubleshooter as recommended and will see what happens.

<p>
</p><p>This has been an issue with me for about 6 months.&nbsp; Possibly even the last year (for one account or another).&nbsp; But I have become so desensitized to it, I cant remember how long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell the issue is with Windows 10 Mail app.&nbsp; But since that is baked into Windows, I wouldn't be surprised it is more wide spread.&nbsp; I don't have the issue on my phones or iPad.&nbsp; Nor on my Mac.&nbsp; Only windows laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to occur at least once a day.&nbsp; Sometimes multiple times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tracked if there is anything going on with the other devices at the same time, or previous to the Windows machine doing a sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, my system is:</p>
<p>- Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>- Version 1703, OS Build: 15063.726</p>
<p>- 64 bit, Intel 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account that is reporting the issue (now) is my goDaddy based email account.&nbsp; Previous it used to report it for my outlook account.&nbsp; Strangely it has never reported this any of my other email accounts.&nbsp; And like previous postings, it does not stop you
 from using the account, nor are you required to change passwords.&nbsp; It just says "out of date" and then goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the exact error message you get?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you get error code prior or following the error message?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the driver, application, game or the software of the older operating system fails to work properly in the current operating system, you can always make it programmable
 in the <strong>compatibility mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the game in
<strong>compatibility </strong></span><strong><span>mode</span></strong><span> by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Compatibility mode</span></strong><span> runs the program in the current version of Windows using the
 settings from previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Locate and <strong>
right-click</strong> on the game setup file and click on <strong>properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on the <strong>
compatibility </strong>tab, check the box <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>, select Windows&nbsp;10 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done,
<strong>restart</strong> the computer for the effective changes to take place.</span></p>
</li></ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply to few more questions to assist you accordingly:</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Was any operating system installed prior to Windows 10 OS?</span></p>

<span>Does the issue persists only with Tangent game?</span></p>

<p><span>You will not be able to select the compatibility of the operating system from the drop down bar as the device came pre-installed with Windows 10 on the purchase. You

<h2>            how to fix Stop 0x1E_c0000005 Blue screen Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I've been having constant bluescreens for about a month now, and am becoming a little disenchanted with my windows 7 experience, as I've been trying to resolve it by updating drivers, disk integrity check, re-install graphic drivers etc...and on top of this&nbsp;my
 pc is only about 7 months old. If someone could tell me how to resolve this BSOD error, I'd be so thankful!</p>
<p>thanks for your time.</p>

            <p>Hello Tim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was looking this thread over.&nbsp; I noticed that you received a stop 0x24.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these&lt;and possibly the others&gt; I recommend that you run chkdsk:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to this, I would further advise uninstalling antivirus and then reinstalling with the latest version available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this fails, I would move towards clean boot troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Details can be found in the following link:</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
One tip - when you have more than a few minidumps please zip them altogether in<br />
one zip so it is easy to download. Not a big deal here since you only had 5. It is not<br />
necessary to zip the individual minidumps to upload them. Sorry I did not make that
<br />
clear before and it was not a big deal in this case.<br />

Unfortunately all of the CAUSE were shown as various Windows components which <br />
means other hidden causes drove them into Fault. Often this means the root cause <br />
was hardware, something that loads at a low level such as BIOS, low level chipset
<br />
drivers, and possible interaction with those by&nbsp;other major device drivers. Added that
<br />
the variety of the Bug_Checks also indicates the same conclusion.<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = 1606&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
BiosReleaseDate = 08/24/2010&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- low level chipset drivers are probably this old or older.<br />
</strong>BaseBoardManufacturer = ASUSTeK Computer INC.<br />
BaseBoardProduct = M4A89GTD-PRO/USB3<br />
BaseBoardVersion = Rev 1.xx<br />

<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Remove ALL power and reseat the cards, ,memory, and cables (on both ends when<br />
possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out any dust bunnies<br />
and add a small fan blowing into the intake to see if heat has a role (heat related does not<br />
mean excessive amounts as sometimes a component part can be too sensitive to even<br />
the normal levels of heat.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Update the <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and
<strong>other major on-board</strong> <strong>and separate<br />
major device drivers</strong>. For the major device drivers use DriverView in the troubleshooter<br />
above - VIEW set to Hide Microsoft drivers and update all the major ones without Dump<br />
in their name. I noticed you updated the ATI video drivers so do same for the Atheros<br />
and any other network drivers, the sound and other drivers. Don't forget to update the BIOS<br />
and low level chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Run driver verifier to see if any drivers are indicated (do this after all the drivers are<br />
updated)&nbsp;and if there are minidumps created then upload them so we can analyze them
<br />
and check the minidumps yourself uising BlueScreenView which might indicate the actual
<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> If needed run the memory tests in the troubleshooter above - keep in mind that these<br />
tests do not catch all errors such as slight speed differences in memory sticks that<br />
appeat to be identical - faster memory has to be in front of slower memory. <br />
<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Use the general methods in the troubleshooters previously posted and those below.<br />

</strong><br />
==============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0x00000024<br />
<br />
</strong>Remove ALL power and reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible)<br />
- actually remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />
<br />
The primary cause of this Bug_Check is disk issues however it can be caused by memory problems<br />
and even antivirus/antispyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0x00000024<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>One possible cause of this bug check is disk corruption. Corruption in the NTFS file system or bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk can induce this error. Corrupted SCSI and IDE drivers can also adversely affect the system's ability to read and write to
 disk, thus causing the error.</p>
<p>Another possible cause is depletion of nonpaged pool memory. If the nonpaged pool memory is completely depleted, this error can stop the system. However, during the indexing process, if the amount of available nonpaged pool memory is very low, another kernel-mode
 driver requiring nonpaged pool memory can also trigger this error. <br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>To debug this problem:</em> Use the .cxr&nbsp;(Display Context Record) command with Parameter&nbsp;3, and then use the kb&nbsp;(Display Stack Trace) command.</p>
<p><em>To resolve a disk corruption problem:</em> Check Event Viewer for error messages from SCSI and FASTFAT (System Log) or Autochk (Application Log) that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Try disabling any virus scanners,
 backup programs, or disk defragmenter tools that continually monitor the system. You should also run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Run<strong>Chkdsk&nbsp;/f&nbsp;/r</strong>
 to detect and resolve any file system structural corruption. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition.</p>
<p><em>To resolve a nonpaged pool memory depletion problem:</em> Either add new physical memory to the computer (thus increasing the quantity of nonpaged pool memory available to the kernel), or reduce the number of files on the Services for Macintosh (SFM)
 volume.<br />

<br />
==============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b<br />
<br />
</strong>Try removing and reseating all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug (on a PC) and clean out the dust bunnies and&nbsp;vents. On<br />
a laptop about all that can be done is reseat the memory and clean the vents. (Of course remove<br />
ALL power prior to opening the case.)<br />
<br />
<strong>3b is usually a graphic's driver (display adapter/video driver), other possibilities include<br />
but are not limited to antivirus/antispyware/security programs and even memory (mapping).<br />
<br />
BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This error has been linked to excessive paged pool usage and may occur due to user-mode graphics drivers crossing over and passing bad data to the kernel code.<br />
<br />

 other devices.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            DXDiag won&#39;t show both Video Cards</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I ran a DXDiag and it won't find my second video card. I have two R9 290x's running in Crossfire. Crossfire is activated and both video cards are recognized by Device Manager, Catalyst Control Center, and other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue though is under Display Devices of the DXDiag report, it only shows one video card. Why is this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 update halts</h2>
                    <p>Hello !</p>
<p>Last night i updated my windows 7 but it halted&nbsp;when installing&nbsp;the 16th of the 32 packages. I leaved it alone the whole night, hoping it would recover and successfully update, but this didn't work. This moring i check my machine and it still says "installing
 the 16 of the 32 package"..Does a package take the whole night to install?? I want to force a shutdown but it says "do not power off or unplug your computer",which is embarrassed. I have no other methods but to shutdown my machine by&nbsp;unplugging it. After a
 while I power it on and check the CBS log file at C:\Windows\Logs\CBS. Below are some error records .Can anyone tell me what the cause is and would my forced shutdown do harm to my machine?</p>

                    <p>My x box one will not connect to x box live. It's connected to the internet just fine. I've rebooted my x box several times, and logged out and back into my account, but it fixed nothing.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to do now. I know its connected to the internet just fine, because I can still pull up and watch netflix.</p>
<p>What should I do to fix this?</p>

            I actually tried that already as well. I've pretty much done every form of turning something off, and then back on. The predicament is that I don't even have the option to log into x box live

<h2>            Windows Update is wasting my valuable time&#33;</h2>
                    Why,&nbsp; after enduring six "important" software updates tonight, and the lengthy process of downloading, configuring, installing and restarting, does another "important" update show up not five damn minutes later? With another download, configure, restart
 and install!! Is there anything preventing Microsoft from aggregating all the downloads at once? I am trying to do work here, and I am spending all evening managing Microsoft "important" updates. Please my time is valuable, please stop taking advantage...

            Is there a way to set up a store account that is not limited to 5 machines when your ONLY using free apps? I understand the need to limit the number of machines per store account (due to paid apps being used) but what if I never plan on using paid apps?
<br />
<br />
I have a standardized Windows 8 build designed and configured&nbsp; for public spaces but one of the most time consuming parts of each deployment is creating the new store account, documenting if for our internal records, and finally locating and downloading each
 of the required (free) apps from the store. I ONLY deploy free apps and have no intention of ever using paid apps. I'd like to be able to create a master/control account (several actually) to deploy all of my predefined apps but I'm limited to 5 machines per
 store count. <br />
<br />
These are non-domain connected workstations running Windows 8 Pro.<br />
<br />
Is there any work around to allow unlimited (or a large number of) workstations for a single Microsoft Store account that strictly use free applications?

            <p>I am in a similiar situation.&nbsp; I have only free apps, and have run into issues simply updating the built-in apps, due to having too many computers connected to my account.&nbsp; It might seem like 5 is a lot, but I have my desktop, my old laptop, my Surface,
 my kids' laptops (3), my wife's Surface, and our Surface RT.&nbsp; I'm the admin, I'd like to be able to use my account across all of the devices, syncing settings, etc, and have the apps updated to the latest version.</p>

<p>I have no issues with limiting the number of devices paid apps can be installed on, but I can't even update the built-in apps - Mail, Maps, News...&nbsp;Most of these devices are domain-joined too, so I'm logging in with my domain account.&nbsp; I can't update the
 apps without a Microsoft account, so this creates a bit of an issue.&nbsp; Why is there a&nbsp;limit on the number of devices I can use my account on?&nbsp;</p>

            I actually spoke with a Microsoft support engineer last week and he told me <u>
<b>(THERE IS A WAY)</b></u> to remove the MS Store's 5 device limitation but... Because I did not have my partner number handy or a credit card to pay for the support call/ticket, he could not help me out. The good news is... He completely understood what I
 was asking for and said they had done this for others who requested the same thing. The bad news is, it's going to require me to get the credit card out to pay for the support call.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I was transferred no less than 7 times today when trying to re-connect with the support team I called last week and now it turns out I have submit this request online. I know Microsoft is a huge company, but getting support for something like this just
 should not be this hard.<br />
<br />
In preparation, I created several store accounts that I wish to have this limitation removed for. I am planning on getting that support ticket started this afternoon and will share the results!
<br />
<br />
<b>Wish me luck!</b><br />

            Between my calls this morning and again this afternoon, I have now been transferred and spoken with 14 different people in the various support departments of Microsoft. Several techs I spoke with have said the device limitation can be removed for a store
 account but so far all I have been able to do is get transferred to some other mysterious support team who also can't help (but knows who can). After speaking with these 14 different people, I finally got a support ticket opened (paid for) so hopefully some
 good news is on the way!<br />
<br />
I firmly believe Microsoft has some of the best software in the world and I have submitted several support tickets in the past but I have never dealt with so much bureaucratic nonsense on a single support call in my life. From any company for that matter.<br />
<br />
Your better than this MICROSOFT! Give your software and "paying customers" the support we deserve.

            <p>Hello joshblacher,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a sensor on your motherboard that changes the speed of the fan depending upon ambient temperature. AFAIK there is no way do it any other way, I'm afraid.</p>
