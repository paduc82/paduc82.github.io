<h2>            Windows 10 Home keeps throwing me back to my login screen, after I log in, can&#39;t keep a session open</h2>
                    <p>after cumulative update version 1709, Windows now won't allow me to stay logged in, after a few seconds or even after I've launched something, it throws me back to the login (locked) screen</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>this is so damned infuriating</strong></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created new accounts, I've changed the lock screen to "NEVER", I've made many attempts to fix this on my own, now I need someone from Microsoft to tell me what the hell is going on</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you respond, please be sure your response is helpful and accurate, don't point me to a pointer of a pointer of a reference... tell me how to remedy this or don't resopnd</p>

<p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned by <strong>Jomel_Santos</strong>, there is a known issue where users are asked to log in twice to Windows after updating to Windows 10 version 1709 Fall Creators Update. Our engineering team are working for a resolution for this issue. A workaround
 for the issue is provided and was already mentioned from the previous response. However, if the workaround does not help, you may provide some feedback about it through the Feedback Hub app. Submitting your feedback would let the engineers know additional
 information about the issue about logging in twice after updating to Windows 10 version 1709. As reference, you may follow the steps on this
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></em> on how to submit feedback to Microsoft through the Feedback Hub app. Make sure that you
 include all details that are related to the issue, including the workaround that you have tried, to let the engineers know.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem is that I'm not able to test this work-around as I can't login!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one of the users (my sun), he gets thrown back to the login screen immediately. He will just se his desktop for 1-2 seconds. (first login trial shows the desktop slightly longer). The other (myself) user works fine. I've tried everything from deleting
 his profile and changed screensaver settings in registry. Nothing worked so far. Again - the mis issue is probably that I can't log in as my son and check/change any of his settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way - Win 10 latest autumn update...</p>

<p>Hi Nicki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern about Windows 10 randomly locking the screen can be caused by a change on the system configuration or corrupted system files. To isolate your concern, I'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Windows build version is running on your device? Type winver in the search box and press Enter to help you identify the build.</li><li>Have you made any changes on your device prior to your concern?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps that you've tried to resolve your concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you perform a repair upgrade. It's an overall repair which refresh your system by installing
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> over the existing installation of <em><strong>Windows 10
</strong></em>without losing any data. This method will help us rule out any errors related to corrupted system files. To do this, you can follow the steps created by community MVP
<strong><em>Andre Da Costa</em></strong> found on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">Forum
 Article</a></strong>. Once you're done, check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>The key issue for those experiencing this problem is we CANNOT get pass the login page. Hence, how are we able to do any of the suggested steps to rectify the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the link to the Forum Article you provided requires the problematic laptop to download the ISO file, which we would not be able to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give us a workable solution to this.</p>

<p>SSL Secure Socket Layer, TLS is a newer version of about the same thing, Transmission Layer Security.</p>
<p>There are security certificates that are outdated probably, that deal with encryption between connections and once online they should update along with all the updates you are missing probably.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            You can safely ignore the Timestamp sentence as it just pinpoints to the misbehaving driver. 
<br />I see you have 2018 version of the driver. Can you roll back to an earlier driver?
<br />You would find the older driver on the AMD's site itself.
<br />The reason I want to do this is that certain hardware configurations are not compatible with newest drivers.
<br />Use DDU again and install a driver dating Oct 2017 or sometime around.
<br />If that fails again, fair enough to assume the video card is faulty.

    <title>Virtual Shadow Copy Service is corrupt according to Carbonite tech - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Virtual Shadow Copy Service is corrupt according to Carbonite tech support.</h2>
                    Carbonite has crashed my HP XP MCE 2005 computer ever since I did a drive image restore 6 weeks ago. Tech support said VSS is corrupt and Carbonite needs VSS. Error message is "Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected&nbsp; error CreateFileW(\\Volume....)hr=0x8007005"&nbsp;
 I cannot seem to find a solution online.&nbsp; Support.microsoft.com only lists server updates.&nbsp; My machine is an Athlon 64 X2 dual core.&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp; sfc/scannow finds lots of errors, but my HP CDs are rejected when sfc finishes, so sfc is no help.

            I came across this page at Symantec:<br />
<br />
Error "Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error CreateFileW" appears while running a backup:

<br />
Note sure if that works for Carbonite Backup, but certainly worth a try.

            We also have a system that is having problems with VSS. After your (Frank2007) post I checked if Carbonite was installed; it is. Now I need to do some digging in their forums. I'll post info if I learn of any solution(s).

<p>Yes, actually it is a surprise to me. I do tech support for a university. Here we have some user's who have local admin access to perform job related tasks. It isn't one of our supported products. After my first post, I found that the two policies that were
 listed by the Symantec article for disabling are set at the domain level and&nbsp;<em>cannot</em> be changed.&nbsp;As stated by Ramesh Srinivasan, I don't know if these are the specific policies that Carbonite would need. I just found it interesting that it was present;
 this is the first case that I've seen of it being here.</p>

<p>I was just curious if it was a surprise.</p>
<p>At one time, Carbonite was being offered on some WWW sites as a 30 day trial (I think it still is).</p>
<p>At one time, Sun Microsystems (the Java people) piggybacked an optional trial of Carbonite during their installation as part of some marketing scheme.</p>
<p>What popped into my head was that somebody might have heard and/or thought "free online backup...sounds good...I'll try it" or if they were installing the Java runtime from scratch, they may have not unchecked the install Carbonite option. &nbsp;Installing&nbsp;everything
 with all options must be better, right?</p>
<p>I don't remember what else the Java Runtime installation offers and don't feel like uninstalling mine and reinstalling to see what they are up to now.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of those folks have installed Carbonite by "accident".</p>
<p>If Carbonite was installed with the Java Runtime or if you are not sure, I would just uninstall all of the Java Runtime stuff using Add/Remove Programs, reboot and then reinstall the Java Runtime from scratch and pay attention to the installation so you
 only install things you want and not too many free extras.</p>

            <p>Is this for Internet Explorer?&nbsp; It will be hidden in favor of Edge when you first get into Windows 10.&nbsp; But you can type it in Start Search box to right click Pin to Task Bar. Your IE bookmarks should be loaded already.&nbsp; But If you decide on Edge import
 bookmarks from IE in the Settings.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
For IE be sure to back up your Favorites user folder.&nbsp; For another browser look for the Export link in your Favorites/Bookmarks menu, export to a file you back up.&nbsp; In case the Upgrade doesn't preserve them use the Import button located nearby.

    <title>Print to file woes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Print to file woes</h2>
                    <p>Pardon my language I copied the text directly from a post I made on another forum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I been doing a diet, and I am noticing now that when I print to file, the file size is **** huge in windows, but Linux, it is way smaller. The 23/24 I printed to file on my laptop running arch. The other days where the file size is small, is when I
 had kubuntu on my desktop. Since day 19, it has been windows 10 print to file. What the hell is so different to make the file sizes so huge? I know it isn't content, because they are all pretty much the same amount of content in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the exact same thing to both operations when I print to file, from linux distros and Windows 10. Can a microsoft rep, one that honestly knows and will not spit out what ever answer to hush someone, tell me why is it the file sizes are so much
 larger? There is no need for it at all. Just wasting space on me.</p>

            No offense, but why does it matter about why I care about the file size, I do though because it is on my dropbox. And unless someone is going to pay yearly for me to have more space, then I want the best compression I can get. I'll probably just stick
 to linux for my print to file needs I guess. There is no original file anyways, since it is online in myfitnesspayl.com. I know the basics of print to file, I know that graphics will make it larger. Every single one of these files have the exact same content.
 Just text with some blue bars for boarders. That is all. I still do not see the reason for the Microsoft standard print to file to be absurdly huge compared to linux.

            I just started using water fox 3 days ago because it is faster then firefox. I should have made that clear in my first post. I unistalled adobe reader DC because I was having issues with it. The app itself would keep a copy of the process open, which would
 cause me to not be able to delete pdf files in that directory. I was resizing the files with an online tool and deleting the larger ones when I noticed this. Even closing the process still did not resolve the issue, a reboot did for 10 seconds until I started
 to delete them again.

            <p>Yes the same problem persisted with Firefox, without trying to sound rude, but that should eb obvious by my original post.&nbsp; I was on Linux before I installed 10, so no the problems were not present in Linux, but if I remember correctly back when I ran windows
 7, yes the problems existed with the large print file size. No I did not contact adobe as I though it was a Microsoft related issue. According to a guy I talked to who knows the Github repo for waterfox, he says yes it is supported by all 64 bit windows systems.
 &nbsp;And I fixed the other issue with the long install time, that I solved myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AGAIN though for clarification.. I came directly from Linux to Windows 10, So it was a clean install, the time to install was much faster.</p>

<h2>            Skype Insider Preview &#47;&#47; New Icons &#47;&#47; Available on Android 6&#43; and iOS devices</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Insiders!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have noticed Skype feels a little different on Android and iOS in the 8.17 version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We released something that has been several months in the making, an updated icon set. We compared old and new metaphors, unified the radii, and fixed grid alignment and line weight. The new icons are intended to feel more like Skype while still being aligned
 with universally recognized symbols for things to reduce confusion. <span>Let us know what you think!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The new icon set</p>

            Got it thanks. I also have another question, I currently use the Skype Insider app on my iPad, and it works great. Do you know when v8 will be officially released on the iPad? Also, will you maintain the separate iPad app or make the iPhone app universal
 in the future?&nbsp;

<h3> ryu fox kazuma  say:</h3>
<h2>            0 gamerscore account spamming&#47;friend requests should be a thing again.</h2>
                    So here recently I've been getting random notifications letting me know that someone has added me as a friend. Without any hesitation I immediately block whomever adds me without first messaging and/or contacting me first and I'll tell you why. One day
 about a year ago I get this out of the blue friend notification and following it was a message. "Hey, I saw you on my suggested friends and I thought why not". My first thought was ok cool, no biggie. Further down the conversation it begins to lead to me getting
 asked if I wanted to check out a "live stream" that this individual was a part of and proceeds to send me a link. First red flag goes up. I then go and check out this person's profile and see that they have nothing but a big 0 gamerscore and little to no bio.
 I then block this person without saying anything more and put it behind me. The next day and a couple there after I get these brand new accounts spamming me with saying that I've been added as a friend. I've blocked each one.

<p>Don't just block them. Report them as well. That'll get the enforcement team involved to investigate the accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, there is not a way to block people from following you. You can go through privacy settings, like you said, and either block other people from seeing your activity or sending messages to hopefully cut down on some of it.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi David.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try repairing Device Manager by running System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>.
<br />
<br />But the problem may more likely be Account Corruption which is epidemic in Windows 10.  If it won't repair, try creating a Local Admin test Account to see if it or anything else that's broken works correctly:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If so you can try continuiing to repair from the old account or switch over to the new Account and eventually delete the old one.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Wifi adapter disabled on reboot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wifi adapter disabled on reboot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
Every time I restart my Windows 8 laptop, the wifi adapter is disabled, saying it has reported problems, and has to be disabled and then enabled to get it working. I posted something here before however I didn't know then that the problem occurred when rebooting,
 I thought it occurred randomly. I got the standard help like "update the drivers" and "do windows update" and I did those and also reinstalled the driver and still it happens. It is a Realtek RTL8723AE wifi adapter that came with my laptop. I even tried the
 troubleshooting as described here (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-network-adapter-problems#1TC=windows-8) but it reported that there were no problems with the wifi adapter.</p>
<p>What can I do to fix this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello ReeceJones,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned that&nbsp;when you try the steps provided in the article which&nbsp;you have mentioned reports that there is no issue with the Wi-Fi adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description your Wi-Fi adapter get disabled after&nbsp;each restart. So there might be a chance that some start up files or application might be the culprit. In order to find out that start up files, I would suggest you to

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. I did a system file check, and it reported that there were no problems. I then did a clean boot, however since a clean boot disables most drivers, it actually disabled the wifi driver, so I couldn't use wifi anyway and I don't
 know if the problem occurred again.</p>
<p>Maybe I didn't make myself clear enough before, but the problem of the wifi adapter being disabled only happens after I click restart from the power menu option, not after a normal shutdown and then startup.</p>

            <p>Hi Reecejones,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with you that while performing clean boot Wi-Fi service and start up gets disabled. I apology for not providing detailed information about the steps. You need to enable it manually after performing clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the steps provided below to enable it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>
’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click <strong>‘Ok’</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the
<strong>Services</strong> tab, and then click to select the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box.</span></li><li><span>Click on Wi-Fi service check box in the service list.</span></li><li><span>Click OK
</span><span>and then click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the same way check in Start items too, if you find any start items related to Wi-Fi then please try to enable it and restart the computer. After enabling Wi-Fi service and
 start ups check the status. Do get back to us with the result and we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue and sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's first try to start the wireless service i.e. WLAN AutoConfig service manually. To do this, login to the computer as an administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enable Wireless service.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and type services.msc in the search field and press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Scroll down to find “<strong>WLAN AutoConfig</strong> ".</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click “<strong>WLAN AutoConfig</strong> “, and then click
<strong>Start</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Starting/Restarting service help lots of people in resolving such type of issues. Actually, when&nbsp;we restart the service it starts to establish&nbsp;connection from the beginning and there is more probability that it gets connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not tried to start the service, please try to do that and if issue still persist try to create new user profile as an administrator and then check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you create new user account nothing will be lost, it is only the thing that it would be in the other user account which you are using right now. However creating new user account is a diagnostic step, if everything works fine in new user account
 we can easily move the files and programs to new user account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, for now please try to create new user account as an administrator from the link provided below. Make sure you should follow the steps mentioned under

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue. <span>As we have exhausted with all of the steps, so now I would suggest you to perform a Refresh on your computer and check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows logo + W</strong> to open the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Now type <strong>Refresh your PC</strong> and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Now click <strong>Get Started</strong> under <strong>Refresh your PC without affecting your files.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>d. Now click <strong>Next.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: </span><span>Refreshing Windows 8 will remove all third party applications installed and it will reset all the Microsoft applications to default.</span></p>

<p><strong>Install or change a display language</strong> <br />
<br />
You can change the language Windows uses to display text in wizards, dialog boxes, menus, and other items in the user interface. Some display languages are installed by default, while others require you to install additional language files.<br />
<br />
Before you can install a display language, you need access to the language files. These files can be found on your computer, a computer in your network, or your Windows DVD. They can also be downloaded from the web. For more information, see How do I get additional
 display languages?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;To install a display language<br />
To install a Language Interface Pack (LIP), double-click the file to open the setup program. To install a Multilingual User Interface Pack (MUI), follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Click to open Region and Language. <br />
<br />
Click the Keyboards and Languages tab.<br />
<br />
Under Display language, click Install/uninstall languages, and then follow the steps.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
The Display language section will only be visible if you have already installed an LIP or if your edition of Windows supports an MUI. MUIs are only available in Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows 7 Enterprise.<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;To change your display language</strong> <br />
When you change the display language, the text in menus and dialog boxes for some programs might not be in the language that you want. This happens because the program might not support Unicode. For more information about changing the text in menus and dialog
 boxes for programs that don't support Unicode, see Change the system locale.<br />
<br />
If you want to set the display language for multiple users or for the Welcome screen, see Apply regional and language settings to reserved accounts.<br />
<br />
Click to open Region and Language. <br />
<br />
Click the Keyboards and Languages tab.<br />
<br />
Under Display language, choose a language from the list, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
If you don't see the list of display languages, you need to install additional language files.</p>
<p>If it's a Win7 Ultimate computer, see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972813 <br />
<br />
If not, see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Add-or-change-an-input-language<br />

    <title>Activate Windows Watermark in the bottom right. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinfete  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate Windows Watermark in the bottom right.</h2>
                    So, I bought my computer about a year ago and it came with windows 10 on it and I don't believe it came with an activation code or I accidentally threw it out and it was already pre installed on there. Now, I'm getting an error saying it's not activated
 anymore and the error code is 0xC004F074 it's kind of making me angry because it's my gaming computer and I've had it for about a year now and just now I'm getting this error. Is there a way for me to find the original activation code from the UEFI/BIOS to
 reactivate it?

            Hi Justin.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use this method to look for the embedded Product Key:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/find-windows-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/find-windows-prod...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert it at Setings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Activation using the button to Change Product Key.  
<br />
<br />If it doesn't work make sure you have the correct version there, which is almost always Home.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If the system says it's in use, then it's in use somewhere on Microsoft's servers. The gamertag system is in use on other Microsoft services, so even if it's not in use on an Xbox, it may be in use elsewhere. The system also doesn't see things like spaces
 as making a gamertag unique. So even if it doesn't show when you search "Slime SZN" it is in use as "SlimeSZN"

            Hi Raul, see if that option is available in the Windows Recovery Environment:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous version of Windows

<p>
</p><p>- restarting the existing Windows 10 installation (that I want to replace with a fresh installation because it keeps crashing and the hardware tests say the hardware is fine) using SHIFT-Restart, and selecting "USB" from the menu of restart options</p>
<p>

<p>There are 2 possible problems:</p>
<p>1. The installation media was not created correctly and is not bootable, the file structure of the Flash drive should look something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33212fd4-f95d-4925-b202-12de31a35cd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33212fd4-f95d-4925-b202-12de31a35cd0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS, go into your BIOS and make the
 following changes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Insert the Bootable Media</span></li><li><span>Disable Secure Boot</span></li><li><span>Enable Legacy Boot</span></li><li><span>If Available enable CSM</span></li><li><span>If Required enable USB Boot</span></li><li><span>Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order</span></li><li><span>Save BIOS changes and restart your System</span></li></ol>

<p>The file structure is fine and as expected on the stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, it DOES seem to boot form the stick. It takes significantly longer than the boot from disk, AND I wrote the methods I used to boot. If the system had not found a bootable system on the stick I would have seen an error, and if it silently (without
 error) would have booted from the HD I would have seen the normal system startup (if not, why not?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB stick is listed as system boot option (BIOS-generated boot menu) - and THAT specific stick (vendor name), not just something generic like "USB Device".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it booted from HD I'd get the regular Windows 10 login. While the system keeps crashing it still boots normally, the crashing only happens after I'm already on the normal user desktop. I've never seen a "Needs to be repaired" message from the installed
 Windows 10 system - what it does is seemingly behave normally and crash at later points.</p>

<p>I don't see your Dell XPS listed as supporting the Creators Update and that might be a factor:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How the boot media was created could be a factor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned Windows 10 keeps crashing when you arrive at the desktop. It is possible reason for the slowness when booting from the USB media, there is an issue with the local storage, either it is damaged, corrupt or failing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try checking the drives health first to see if its ok, since this might by why the USB thumb drive is so slow to boot from; its having a problem writing pre-boot to the drive to facilitate setup.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep in mind, the laptop is not listed as supporting Windows 10 and that might be a source of the crashing at the desktop. Which version and edition of Windows originally came preinstalled with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>It is already installed and running!&nbsp;(I wrote that.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I merely want to reinstall a system that has been there since the release of Windows 10. Including "Creator update" - it only started misbehaving very recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;<span>How the boot media was created could be a factor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I pointed to my previous post where the instructions for stuck creation are linked. It's been used by many people before.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;<span>It is possible reason for the slowness when booting from the USB media</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Uhm... I think the reason it doesn't boot as fast from a USB(2) stick compared to the local SSD is... that an internal&nbsp; SSD is a lot faster. Naturally.</span></p>
