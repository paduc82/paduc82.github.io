<h2>            Taskbar error message</h2>
                    Hi, after the latest windows update, I get a 7 + taskbar tweaker incompatibility warning message. It says that it seems I am using an unsupported build of Windows 10(an insider build). That I can proceed, but windows may crash or hang, the tweaker can
 fail. Why did I get this message and how do I fix it?

            Sorry, we can help only on Windows related issues. This is more of a Separate Software question, so I suggest you to ask the developer itself

    <title>Can I download the Windows 10 free upgrade onto a USB for boot&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I download the Windows 10 free upgrade onto a USB for boot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am soon to build my own computer and I don't want to pay for windows 10 twice. You see, the thing is, is that I get my computer parts for my birthday Soon after current windows customers get their free upgrade. I have reserved my upgrade and will get it
 but I would like to download it and put it on a USB and use it for my new computer, not my old one. Otherwise, I have to pay twice and all I want is a sort of holding place for the OS image until my new PC arrives. I understand that I can only upgrade one
 computer once, and that will be my ne PC. I'd just like to know if that is possible and how to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of you have any questions (as this could of been worded a better), then feel free to ask!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: My budget is ~£1600 / $2400 and having to buy an OS would exceed that. (Tight fisted I know, but I'd rather not spend if I can :-)</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing is to cancel your reservation for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see the "GET WINDOWS 10" app&nbsp;appear&nbsp;again, but don't reserve again for the old computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wait until you have the new&nbsp;computer&nbsp;setup and when it appears on that computer's screen, then reserve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app will continue to appear on&nbsp;computers for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have until the 29 July 2016 to get the free&nbsp;Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

<p>Hi Mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the new computer will be built from scratch and will not have any OS installed on it in the first place. Therefor, I cannot go on the new PC and click on the get Windows 10 icon because there would be no windows OS on there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for not explaining that, was in a rush at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd like to know is instead of using the update for my own computer, can I claim is and then carry it over to my new PC as a bootable image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for the response but it is a little unclear - as I replied to mark, I would like to claim my upgrade but use it for my new computer and leave my current computer on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I do this or not? It would save me from paying for an OS unecessarily for my new computer, as I will not use my old one again after. (It would be upgraded and then not used again, whilst my new computer would be needing an OS too)</p>

            <p>Short answer to your question is No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets see if we can make your options clearer.</p>
<p>Is the copy of windows currently installed on you old pc a retail version (stand alone/bought separately) or OEM (pre installed when you purchased the pc)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it is OEM&nbsp;The license dies with the old computer, you will have to purchase windows 10 for your new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is a retail version you have the right to transfer it to your new pc, you must however, remove it from the old pc. This right will exist even after upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>you then have a choice </p>
<p>1)install the upgrade on your old computer, create a recovery drive, use it to install windows 10 on your new computer and remove windows from your old computer.
</p>
<p>OR </p>
<p>2)remove windows 7 from your old computer, install it on your new computer and then upgrade (which is what Mark suggested) this will give the option (for 30 days) to go back to windows 7 easily, if you don't like windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note - you can not upgrade to windows 10 and still use windows 7 on another computer, if you want to have windows on two computers you will need two licenses.</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With&nbsp;your 1st&nbsp;question, I was not sure as to what parts you were getting and if you were simply upgrading the old PC or building a new one altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I understand what you are planning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the reply from <strong>Martmcd</strong>, he is correct&nbsp;in what he is saying when it comes to&nbsp;what you can and cannot do as far as transferring Windows Operating Systems&nbsp;from the old PC to a new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;way of finding out which type of licence you have is, check the key code label (the Certificate of Authenticity) and see if the letters&nbsp;<strong>OEM</strong> are on it - It maybe somewhere on the computer case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does have <strong>OEM,</strong> then it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
cannot</span> be transferred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't have <strong>OEM</strong>, then it is a Full Packaged Product (Retail) version and they came complete with the Genuine&nbsp;Windows (32 &amp; 64 bit) DVDs&nbsp;- this type&nbsp;can be transferred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thing, why not try Windows 10 on the old PC and see if you like it before you build the new PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

            <p>Thank you, this is a lot clearer. However, I just have to make it more complicated! I bought my PC for PCSpecialist ( a custom computer building service and I chose windows 7 home premium as an extra. I guess this is OEM? Am I right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is a retail version, I know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am not sure as they might have used a CD copy / USB image?&nbsp;</p>

            Why not ask the people who sold it to you?&nbsp; Odds are it's a system builder (OEM) version, but we have no way of knowing.

<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your help ( and Martmcd's ).just to say, I have replied to this after I have replied to Martmcd's response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now understand fully. When I bought the custom laptop from pcspecialist.com , it came with a CD copy of windows 7 home premium. So this is a retail copy, yes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how would I remove windows on my old laptop and put it onto my new desktop. I guess I could remove it from my laptop, then install it on my new PC (which is a desktop) and then click on the get windows 10 icon in the system tray?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to you and Martmcd for all your help,</p>

            <p>&nbsp; Hey Chris,</p>
<p>Really sorry to be the bearer of bad news but according to every thing I've read you must have ether Windows 7 with SP1 or Windows 8.1. If you have one of these on the old computer and it's a good Hard Drive in the old computer you may want to consider installing
 it into the new computer and booting from it. </p>

<h2>            Mouse without Borders&#58; macOS support &#47; open protocol</h2>
                    Is there any chance to open up the mouse without borders protocol or provide a macOS version so keyboard/mouse can be shared across operating systems. I do lots of cross platform development and use windows boxes next to macOS. Using the excellent mouse
 without borders on those platforms would be amazing.

<h2>            Multiple issues with Windows Vista security&#47;system restore&#47;etc.</h2>
                    
<p>This morning when I went to use my computer, I found that I am having multiple issues with it (after it working just fine last night when I was on it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Any web page that requires you to sign in, brings up a Certificate Error: Navigation Blocked

</p>
<p>*I had Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender on the computer.&nbsp; I had never had issues with them before.&nbsp; But today, those won't work.&nbsp; I couldn't get either to turn on.&nbsp; After looking up error codes, etc. online, I ended up trying to uninstall/reinstall
 them on the computer.&nbsp; I was able to uninstall MSE, but the computer will not let me reinstall it.&nbsp; I am not able to uninstall WD. When I try&nbsp;to turn on Windows Defender, I get this error message:</p>
<p><em>Application failed to initialize: 0x800106ba.&nbsp; A problem caused this program's service to stop.&nbsp; To start this service, restart your computer or search Help and Support for how to start a service manually.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(</em>Restarting the computer does not fix the problem.&nbsp; I have been unable to manually start it either.)</p>
<p>*I tried to install different virus protection software, but the computer will not install that either.</p>
<p>*I had Windows Updates available to install...I tried to install them, but they would not install.&nbsp; For this, I get error code 8007005.</p>
<p>*I've also tried a system restore, but it also fails.</p>
<p>How can I get this fixed??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi chrissy725,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, you cannot uninstall Windows Defender. Windows Defender on Windows Vista is a pre-installed Windows Security Feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try to re-install Microsoft Security Essentials? Do you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you using internet Explorer? If yes, what is the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Find-out-which-version-of-Internet-Explorer-youre-using" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">version</a>?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 were the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updates available</a><span>&nbsp;</span>for installation which failed with an error 0x8007005?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try installing the updates manually?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error when tried to perform System restore?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: There is a problem with this website's security certificate" when you try to visit a secured website in Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931850</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Error message when you run Windows Defender: "Error Code 0x800106ba"</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931849</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Reset the Windows Update components</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try resetting the windows update components and then try to install the updates.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If those updates were definition update for Windows defender, then follow the steps from the article:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB918355</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4: Perform system restore from Safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists beyond these steps, then try performing system restore from<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe
 mode.</a></span></p>

<p>Hey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I try to install a downloaded upgrade to something (e.g. itunes/google chrome) this message always comes up and stops it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>expand.exe - Bad Image</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32\dpx.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor or more support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p><span>Hi frjk69,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> You may also refer the following link and perform
<strong>an online scan</strong> on your computer to check whether your computer is been infected by any virus.
</span></p>

<p><span>This issue may also occur if a particular dll file is missing or corrupt. You may try running a SFC (system file checker) scan and check what happens.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step2: SFC Scan
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1) Close all the open windows.
</span></p>
<p><span>2) Click the
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>"All programs</strong>", and click "<strong>Accessories".</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>3) Right-click "<strong>Command Prompt</strong>" and click "<strong>Run as administrator".</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4) In "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type in "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>" (without the quotes) and press Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span>5) Restart the computer after completing the SFC scan.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer the Method -The System File Checker tool in the following KB article:

<blockquote>can you help me whith a danish&nbsp; language pack to my windows 7 home premium</blockquote>
Sorry, you need Windows 7 Ultimate for that or you need to check LIPs <br />
<br />
Language Interface Packs (LIPs)
<p>As was the case in Vista, Windows 7 will continue to enable the widest range of people across the world to use Windows 7 in their own language using Language Interface Packs. LIPs are built on the MUI technology and provide localization of the UI most commonly
 used by Windows users. LIPs do not require a license and can be <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/unlimitedpotential/programs/llp.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
downloaded for free</a> to be installed on any edition of Windows 7: Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate.</p>
Because the entire user interface is not translated, LIPs require that at least one parent language be present on the machine in order to be installed. After the LIP is installed and selected as the user interface language, the parts of the user interface that
 are not translated into the LIP language are displayed in the parent language. Some LIP languages allow more than one language as parent language. For example, the Catalan LIP can be installed if the Spanish language pack or the French language pack is already
 installed on the system. The parent language requirements are specified on each LIP download page.
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Bluetooth headphones are paired but don&#39;t autoconnect anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hey folks - appreciate any help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pair of Sony MDR1-ABT bluetooth headphones. (Amazing BTW, go get some...) In the early versions of Windows 10, when I powered on my headphones, Windows (which was already booted) would detect them and connect automatically. In one of the recent
 updates, the headphones no longer automatically connect; if I go to Action Center, click Connect, and click on the headphones, they connect and work perfectly. Or if I right-click the volume icon in the task bar, go to Playback Devices, right-click the headphones
 and click connect, they work fine. It's not the end of the world, but it *is* frustrating that this worked perfectly in past versions. (I have removed and re-paired multiple times but same result.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance...</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To assist you better I would like to know, which Windows 10 build are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check it this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>At first, I suggest you to check if any Windows update is pending. Type update on the Windows search bar, select Windows update, click on Check for updates button and Install Windows update (If available.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If that does not help to fix the issue, I recommend you to run app troubleshooter and check if it helps. Follow the below link to run app troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, it might be possible that the user profile is being corrupt. Let’s create a new user account and try log-in to the Windows store using Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-10</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the result.
</span></p>

<h2>            Error resetting PC, &#34;Your PC did not start correctly&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>So basically what happens is when i try to boot up my PC it says "Preparing automatic repair" or something like that, then a little while later it says: "Diagnosing your PC".</p>
<p>When that's over i get an error message saying: "Your PC did not start correctly".</p>
<p>i have tried restarting it countless times but it doesnt help. I then went to do a complete reset of my PC (i cant login as i said so i am doing this with that Troubleshoot thing that i cant remember the name of, but basically im stuck in this blue interface
 where i can choose to reset or whatever) as I dont really have anything important on there, but I then get the error message when its over like 50% complete: "There was a problem resetting your PC"</p>
<p>this happens when i try to do a complete reset, but also when i choose to keep my files.</p>
<p>I have tried booting my PC from a USB drive with windows 10 on it with no success either. Is it important that there is only the .iso file on the usb drive, or is it okay if there is a folder on the USB as well? Because i do have a folder on there with some
 work documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have a desktop PC that i built myself, and i therefore dont have a recovery disk.</p>
<p>My windows version is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is not too confusing,if you need any further info just ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Marcus.</p>

            <p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you are facing. I will certainly help you with this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform a <strong>“Startup Repair”</strong> using Windows 10 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps. Initiating repair from CD/DVD may have different results than earlier since the source of boot is different now. So, I would
 suggest to perform the repair again and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you don’t have the bootable DVD or USB drive, please refer to the steps in the article given below to create one and then follow the steps given below.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once you have made the bootable USB or DVD drive, please follow the steps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Insert the <strong><span>installation DVD or USB</span></strong><strong>

</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You might also require to change the boot priority in BIOS in order to allow the computer to boot from CD/DVD.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to us on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try following the suggestions as discussed in the following thread, which might involve complete removal of the drivers associated with the printer and reinstalling afresh on the system while communicating with the printer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/print-spooler-keeps-stopping-easy-fixes/8a05c631-f223-40d3-b2bf-4e8ab5e6fcfa">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/print-spooler-keeps-stopping-easy-fixes/8a05c631-f223-40d3-b2bf-4e8ab5e6fcfa</a>

<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these
 steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article
 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. </span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you’ve removed the printer completely from the computer, I would suggest you to try installing the latest drivers available on
<a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=232591&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=OSF_W_8_1-64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This should resolve the issue. However, if the issue still persists, please do get back to us for further assistance on this. We’ll be glad to assist you from here.

    <title>Windows 10 retail license linked to Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> griudom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 retail license linked to Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I have a doubt regarding my Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>Some time ago I bought a retail license and now in the Windows configuration section the following message appears: "Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account".&nbsp;The thing is that I don't use that account anymore (hotmail)
 since now I use Outlook.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use my license number (in case I change my computer) or do I have to use my old mail? I mean, can I log in into my new outlook account and activate Windows by using my license number or is it required to use my hotmail account to which
 now it says that it is linked?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
                </div>

<p>The key will still work but the Digital LIcense takes precedence until you want to change a retail license to an entirely different PC using the Product Key.&nbsp; Hardware changes using the DL are limited to parts changes including motherboards which require
 reactivating using the Activation Troubleshooter:&nbsp; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reactivating Windows 10 after a hardware change</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>You said you presently have the Digital License linked to an old MS account email address you changed.
<br />
<br />
I showed you how to change the email address on the same account if you haven't already used it to create a new MS Account, after which it cannot be used to change the old MS account email address since you must use a fresh email address to change MS Account
 email or start a new MS account. <br />
<br />
If you've already created the new MS account then I also showed you how to change it in Windows 10, either by converting your old MS to a Local account first so you can then change it back to the new MS Account; or by creating a new Admin MS account to move
 into and then when ready delete the old MS account. <br />
<br />
Once you are signing into Windows 10 with the new Admin MS Account, it will change the Digital LIcense to the new account.
<br />
<br />
If you have any problems navigating the steps with illustrated tutorials I gave, just ask back any questions.

    <title>Missing files found in CAB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drsgeoffdavis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing files found in CAB</h2>
                    <p>I have created&nbsp;2 subfolders under C:\Temp\MyTopLevelSubFolder,&nbsp;Each contains 4 images.</p>
<p>I have a process that takes these images converts, renames them and copies them to another folder, indefinitely...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "process"&nbsp;(a simulated scanner) falls over after a number of hours "scanning" as the source images can no longer be found.</p>
<p>Looking into the problem, I find my source images are now in a MyTopLevelSubFolder.CAB file and the individual files deleted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What (on earth) is likely to be happening here !?</p>
<p>They are my files, why are they being compressed and deleted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone?</p>
<p />
