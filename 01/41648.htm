==============================================<br />
Do the unwanted copies have filenames with<br />
the prefix "copy of"?<br />
<br />
Example: Copy of IMG_1455.JPG<br />
<br />
If_yes_maybe the following tutorial I wrote<br />
for XP will offer some ideas:<br />
<br />
Also...there is a link to a different method<br />
at the end of this tutorial.<br />
<br />
Here's how to reproduce the unwanted<br />
copying...<br />
<br />
Hold your Ctrl key and select several files...<br />
<br />
Place your pointer on the selected group<br />
(still holding the ctrl key) and left click / drag<br />
the group even just the slightest bit...now<br />
release the mouse button.<br />
<br />
Oooops...more copies...<br />
<br />
Maybe the following info will help:<br />
<br />
It happens occasionally to most anyone who<br />
is trying to multiple select by holding the Ctrl<br />
or Shift key while left clicking to select the<br />
image files.<br />
<br />
The copies are created when you fail to<br />
completely release the mouse button before<br />
you move the pointer to another file. If a group<br />
of selected files is dragged...even the slightest<br />
bit...releasing the mouse button will produce<br />
copies of all the previously highlighted files.<br />
<br />
It's somewhat easier if you have your Folder<br />
Options set to Single Click...this way you can<br />
select/deselect a file with just a mouse over<br />
and you don't have to click. For multiples you<br />
still have to hold...Ctrl or Shift.<br />
<br />
No click...no drag...no copy...maybe that's<br />
your solution. To adjust for single click...<br />
Open a folder and go to...Tools / Folder<br />
Options / General tab...tick..."Single Click<br />
To Open An Item" / Apply / OK.<br />
<br />
If you wish to delete all the files in a folder<br />
you could try the following:<br />
<br />
Go to...Edit / Select All...or type...Ctrl / A...<br />
<br />
With all files selected...go to...File / Delete...<br />
or press your Delete key...or...right click the<br />
group and choose "Delete".<br />
<br />
How to search for and delete unwanted "copies"<br />
of your image files.<br />
<br />
Open the folder that the images are saved in and<br />
left click the "Search" button on your toolbar.<br />
<br />
(If you are viewing the files from within an editing<br />
program and do not know where the folder is...right<br />
click one of the image files and from the menu...<br />
choose...Properties. The path to the folder will be<br />
on the "General" tab at "Location".)<br />
<br />
In the search pane...select..."All files and folders"<br />
<br />
In the "All or part of the file name" field...enter...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of<br />
<br />
Now...left click the "Search" button.<br />
<br />
When the search is complete...go to...Edit / Select All...<br />
<br />
Then go to...File / Delete.<br />
<br />
You will see a dialog box asking you if you are sure<br />
you wish to delete the files...click Yes.<br />
<br />
Now...left click the "Back" button on your toolbar.<br />
<br />
Now the remaining files should be your originals.<br />
<br />
If you deleted the wrong files...recover them from<br />
your recycle bin now.<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all of the suggestions* elsewhere, but no matter where I am or what I'm doing, my cursor freaks out all over the screen.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The issue still happens when I click and drag, also 2 finger scroll,
 in every program, and every physical location. It's happened since the day I got the machine, and has survived a few system refreshes. It really has no constant variable controlling when it happens, it just happens, well,&nbsp;<em>whenever.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a gif of what happens, and here I'm not moving my mouse, just have a finger on the touchpad.</p>

            It's doing it again, and now I can confirm it's only doing it when plugged into a specific wall outlet (standard US outlet). Is that an inherit problem with the outlet or with my cord, or my surface...? I recently got a new power cord because of the recall,
 could that be it?

    <title>Surface Book 2 and USB-C - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tinyvaldemar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 and USB-C</h2>
                    <p>I just bought the most expensive Surface Book 2 15. I changed from a MacBook Pro and wanted to move to Windows to test the Surface Book. I connected my LG 5K monitor to my Surface Book but no luck, Windows tells me to make sure my Thunderbolt device is supported.
 I then changed monitor to a Samsung monitor with DP 1.2 and connected my USB-C to DP adapter. Same error message, not supported by Thunderbolt on my Surface Book. No I am stuck with a low end monitor connected using a USB-c to HDMI adapter and its not a great
 experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion how to use a modern monitor with a Surface Book 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a note, shipping it with Thunderbolt 2 instead of 3 seems like a mistake at best</p>

            Did you not read the tech specs before purchasing an expensive device like the Surface Book 2?&nbsp;<br />
You should´ve, because there´s no thunderbolt support.

 is no way of stopping them.&nbsp; I have sought qualified assistance and, with that help I have been through many cleanup operations, and used the Windows diagnostic tools.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; Now I find that many others have the same problems.&nbsp; When can I hope for
 a fix?&nbsp; The repeated downloads of the update files are burning through my data allowance, and I wold like to use that for other activities.</p>

<p>We appreciate the update you have provided. The error code <strong>0x80070652</strong> indicates that a previous installation has not been completed successfully. Generally, restarting your computer would resolve the issue. However, we are seeing threads
 that have similar issues about the updates that you mentioned. With that note, we have sent you a private message to gather more information about the problem. Kindly respond to that message as soon as you are able to. You may access the private message by
 clicking on the <strong>Mail</strong> icon beside the <strong>Ask a Question </strong>
button in the Community (refer to the attached screenshot below).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since several steps have been made to resolve the issue about installing the updates, we suggest that you
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset the Windows Update components</a></em>. This would reset the components back to its default state, including all related
 DLL files and other settings related to Windows Update. After resetting the components, attempt to install the updates again. On a lighter note, we have found a similar thread that has an answer that might help with the issue. You may find that thread on this
<em><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/every-day-windows-update-reinstall-patch-kb4049411/bfe1461c-de04-4161-a571-f95935fc8cf4">link</a></em>. From there, kindly see the answer
 by <strong>Sumit Dhiman2 </strong>and see if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if the update is still attempting to download and install on your computer but keeps on failing, you may prevent it from reinstalling in Windows 10 by downloading and running this
<em><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter</a></em>. For more information about the troubleshooter, kindly read through

<p>

            Hi Jiaxi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What happened right before this started?  Did you receive Windows Updates or make any other changes?
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Slow Shutdown</h2>
                    <p>I have been fighting this for quite some time and have not been able to resolve.&nbsp; On my Lenovo X1 Carbon (4th Generation), shutdown time is usually around 6 minutes.&nbsp; I have tried the usual tricks of disabling Fast Startup, I've run the power troubleshooter,
 I've set ClearPageFileAtShutdown to 0 in the registry, I've changed the value of&nbsp;<span>WaitToKillServiceTimeout from 5000 to 1000 in the registry................all to no avail.&nbsp; If I look at my event logs, during the shutdown I see this message logged:</span></p>

<p>It will finally shut down after about 6 minutes but that is completely ridiculous for a machine with an SSD.</p>

            The issue is likely the Fall Creators Update.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

            Could you provide the full model number for your Lenovo?
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are multiple possible reasons why your computer is slow during shutdowns and one of them is the virtual memory. There are reports that adjusting Page file size to recommended by the System solves many issues. This may sound a little not related, but
 please try this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In <span style="font-weight: bold">Search</span> tab of the Start menu, type "<span style="font-weight: bold">Adjust the appearance and performance of windows</span>" and press
Change</span>... button in the Virtual memory section.</li><li>At the top, uncheck the box right before "<span style="font-weight: bold">Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</span>" option.</li><li>Select drive <span style="font-weight: bold">C: (or the drive where Windows 10 is installed</span>).</li><li>Select Custom size: by ticking its radio button, and change the Initial size (MB) and Maximum size (MB) to the Recommended value that you will find just below the Total paging file size for all drivers section.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We would also suggest that you run the System File Checker tool to scan and fix corrupted system files. You can refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on how to run the <span style="font-weight: bold">SFC Scan</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, I suggest you rollback...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

                    <div>
<p>There are many small-computer devices today (Raspberry Pi and clones, ARM-based TV Boxes, e.t.c) that need to boot using SD card. To create the bootable SD card it is needed
<em>to</em> <em>write image file to the SD card</em>. Actual version of the Windows have no tools to solve this task.
<em>This is impossible without installing the side software </em>like dd clone or Win32DiskImager. My question is:
<em>why not to extend the "copy" command functionality</em> for writing and reading raw data directly to and from storages and partitions?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As sample like this:</p>

<h2>            Wifi keeps on turning itself on and off</h2>
                    I uninstalled my modem driver today, as it was the cause of the blue screens of death that I kept on getting everytime I switched my laptop off. But as a result, afterwards my wifi (on my laptop) keeps on turning on and off by itself, and disconnecting
 from the Internet. Even when I move the laptop a bit, or it suffers some kind of 'shock', the wifi turns off and then back on again.
<div>What is the cause of this and how can I resolve it?</div>
<div>Thank you in advance.</div>

    <title>Japanese text displays incorrectly in Explorer, others - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dottoysm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Japanese text displays incorrectly in Explorer, others</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 last night. Since my locale was set to Japanese it installed the Japanese version of Windows. I prefer to use my computer in English, though, so I installed the English (Australia) language pack.
</p>
<p>However, when I use the computer in English, Japanese appears strange in (File) Explorer and in some settings panes. I have some OneDrive folders and files with Japanese names, and some characters are much larger than others. In the image attached, I have
 some examples on the left of what Exploerer displays, plus how it should look on the right.
</p>
<p>My guess is that Windows mistakenly recognises the text as Chinese and puts in a Chinese font, which is not suitable for Japanese as the characters written differently to Chinese are much smaller. Is there any way to resolve this? It did not happen in my
 installation of Windows 8.1 (which was originally in English)</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Enterprise HP Elitebook 8470p Laptop - Need support on using LAN and Wifi at same time</h2>
                    Hi&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I work in an environment where for internet i need to use wifi and for connecting to internal devices i need to use static IP and LAN port.&nbsp;</div>
<div>For the LAN side i can configure it without gateway IP address. Earlier when i was using windows xp with a different laptop this setup used to work and i was adding static roues in my pc for connecting to LAN side devices.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But with this new Laptop even when i configure my LAN port without gateway IP address it seems to disable my WIFI and not able to get both of them up at the same time. This is lot of hassle as i have to remove LAN cable each time i want to connect internet.
 So guys can you please help me with this issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers !!</div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>UMACHANDRNA,</span></p>
<p>The inability to import photos to your Windows 10 computer may have something to do with the security settings, the change in target location, or the antivirus software installed on your computer. For us to sort
 this out, please do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Changing the security settings.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key + E</strong> to open File Explorer.</li><li>Right-click the <strong>Pictures</strong> folder, then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li><li>Under <em>Group or usernames</em>, select <strong>HomeUsers</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Permissions for HomeUsers</em>, click <strong>Full Control</strong> under
<strong>Allow</strong>, then click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Group or usernames</em>, select <strong>Administrators</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Full Control</strong> under <strong>Allow</strong> in P<em>ermissions for Administrators</em>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Try importing your photos again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check your antivirus.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you have an anti-virus installed, there's a possibility that it's blocking your computer from importing your photos. I suggest temporarily disabling it and see if you're now able to import your photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Restoring the Picture folder default settings</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the <strong>Picture</strong> directory and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Location</strong> tab and click the <strong>Restore Default
</strong>option.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then please check out this article posted by an MVP, Andre Da Costa, about the
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos/complete-guide-to-importing-your-photos-in-windows/d8258fff-729e-45df-8afd-1f1195d7b6c5">Complete Guide to Importing Your Photos in Windows
 10</a></strong> and look into the <strong>Importing photos from an Android device</strong> section.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please update this thread with the result. I'm looking forward to your reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards.</span></p>

<h2>            tabctl32.ocx not compatible with this version of Windows</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to run an old-ish program and it has the tabctl32.ocx error. I've searched for this and found plenty of instructions for how to replace and re-register the file, but it's not working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I follow the instructions and type in the command prompt "regsvr32 system32\TABCTL32.OCX" or type in "regsvr32&nbsp; tabctl32.ocx" in the 'Run' command I receive the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The module 'tabctl32.ocx' may not be compatible with the version of Windows that you're running. Check if the module is compatible with an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of regsvr32.exe"</p>

<p>ActiveX controls (.ocx files) are not supported because they're not secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only web browser that ever supported ActiveX controls was Internet Explorer. I believe IE9 was the last version that supported it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run your program, create a virtual machine and install a version of Windows that included IE 9. Then you can install the program.</p>

 then&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;cancel it. When I tried to restart my computer it went to a black screen (DOS) and said: media file (failed), then it said: NO bootable disk&nbsp; Restart computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm stuck and don't know what to do from here.</p>
<p>Please help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking for a download for Windows 8 boot disk or something, but all I see now is Windows 8.1. Can someone pls direct me to where I may be able to download it to DVD? From what I read Since Windows 8 was already pre-installed and I registered my Laptop
 the product key is inside the drive and it should come up once I can get a copy of the ISO onto the laptop to boot it up.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">OK MY QUESTION IS CAN SOMEONE TELL WHERE TO GO TO MAKE A COPY OR IS THERE ANOTHER WAY I CAN BOOT UP MY SYSTEM. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO USE A WINDOWS 7 BOOT DISK AND THEN UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 8??</span></strong></p>

<div>When I open task manager, disk usage is 100 almost every time. Sometimes it settles down, but still having some weird peaks (for example, it stays at 3%, then suddenly jumps to 70%, then goes back down, then jumps to 80%, and so on), and it always peaks
 to 100 again when I open any software, when I install software, or when I extract files from winrar.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Fixes I tried:</div>
<div>-Disable windows search</div>
<div>-Disable superfetch</div>
<div>-Disable DiagTrack</div>
<div>-Reset virtual memory</div>
<div>-Uninstall third party antivirus software</div>

<div>-Defragment hard drive</div>
<div>-Change energy setting to max performance</div>
<div>
<p>-Chkdsk /f /r</p>
<p>-Sfc /scannow</p>
<p>-Dism&nbsp;dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</p>
</div>
<div>-Update windows</div>
<div>-Update computer drivers</div>
<div>
<p>-Refreshing windows&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a few other things I don't remember now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean booting and booting into safe mode also gave me no clues, as disk usage still was up to 100% in both cases.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what else to do. I don't think this is due to hard drive failure, as this computer is 2 years old max, and it always had this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a side note: in device management, under ide ata/atapi controllers, the only option is "Inte(R) 6th generation core processor familiy platform I/O SATA AHCI controller", but my intel processor is i7
<strong>7th</strong> generation. Could this mean anything?<br />

            Hi Guga 
<br />
<br />You are on the right track . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager
<br />
<br />Expand the IDE ATA/ATAPI section
<br />
<br />Right click the device you will find there and choose 'Uninstall'
<br />
<br />Then restart (not shut down) your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you:
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />choose the Processes tab, then click the Disk Column header so that arrow faces down . . .
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When your Disk is at 100%, what are the top 5 processes at that time?
        </p>

<p>I uninstalled the IDE ATA/ATAPI controller and now windows won't start :l</p>
<p>I started boot up repair and now it's checking disk errors.</p>

            Hi Guga
<br />
<br />That should not stop Windows from starting at all . . .
<br />
<br />Let it check for Disk Errors and then please keep me informed of your progress . . .

<p>Ok, thanks.</p>
<p>Well, the disk error check didn't solve anything, nor did the system recovery I tried to run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I tried to boot up in safe mode and it worked, at least. Now there's only the standart AHCI SATA controller in device management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: alright, now it booted normally. No idea why.</p>
<p>Disc is still at 100 though, and the processes using most of the disc are "system", "sedlauncher", "microsoft office click to run", and a few others that keep changing over time.</p>
<p>The thing is, none of them are using more than 2mb.</p>
