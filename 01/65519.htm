<p><span>Hi, so I have never received my Halo 5 Warthog code for Forza Horizon 3 on Xbox One. I own Halo 5; Guardians and have time played in the game. Just wondering if there are still more codes going out or
 if I just never received mine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If there are anymore details needed just tell me and I'll update with those details in this post.<br />

            <p>Hey there iMW Ethan.</p>
<p>Codes are still being sent out, but if you are eligible for the Warthog in-game, you should be able to access it from the menu of Forza Horizon 3. If you don't have access to the content yet, please keep an eye out on your Xbox Live messages. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Mouse Scroll stopped working for 11th day in a row</h2>
                    My mouse scroll continuously stops working, I have tried all the advice including clean boot. It is a not hardware as when I tap the scroll button it registers. I am using a CiT Avenger gaming mouse. Is there someway to restore the function so this stops
 happening

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When did it last work correctly?  What has changed since then?  Is there a System Restore point to roll back to before then?  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Change the batteries if wireless, try another USB port, reset mouse from button on bottom if available.
<br />
<br />Try the mouse in another PC to isolate if it's the mouse or Windows causing this.
<br />
<br />Try another mouse in this PC to confirm if Windows is the problem.
<br />
<br />Access the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse, then Driver tab. First try Update this Driver &gt; Automatically, then Roll Back if available. If not choose Uninstall button, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Is there mouse software installed in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features? Uninstall it to see if the problem stops. This is unneeded bloatware.
<br />
<br />Adjust the mouse settings in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Mouse, checking all settings including the Additonal Mouse Options box - check Settings on all tabs.
<br />
<br />Report back all results for possible other things to try.
<br />
<br />To check if Windows is causing this you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>...
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thank you for taking the time to help me unfortunately your suggestions all ones I have tried from online searches. The scroll has just started working of its own accord again. I think the best option for me now is to take this to a computer engineer and
 see if that they can trace the issue. Failing that as this PC was purchased one month a go I will be taking it back to supplier for a refund.

            <p>Yes it does. Keep in mind that it's not immediate and there's no way for you to know 100% whether the other person has received some sort of enforcement action. The enforcement team received thousands of complaints every day and they have to investigate each one.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ted.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I still use Works on Windows 10 without problem.
<br />
<br />I also use Office Word.
<br />
<br />Built into WIndows 10 is a decent word processor Wordpad, type in Start Search and right click to More &gt; Pin to Taskbar.
<br />
<br />There are also good compatible free word processors LibreOffice and Open Office. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Ted, If you want to suggest this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your completed feedback (see Share link in feedback box) then I will vote it up with my MVP badge, elevate it to Edge team and track the issue for you.

            <p>There are no Windows 7 drivers for the Intel 82915GX. See <a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=18576&amp;keyword=%2282915%22&amp;lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may experience microphone issues due to physical device damage, outdated drivers, and more. To narrow this down, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried using a different microphone on the same computer?</li><li>Is the microphone not working on other computers?</li><li>Were there any changes made to your computer settings prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can run the audio troubleshooter <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/E/7/FE74974A-9029-41A0-9EB2-9CCE3FC20B99/audio10.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> which may resolve audio problems&nbsp;automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it addressed your concern. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Speakers muted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antoniusb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speakers muted</h2>
                    <p>That is what Skype says when I try to make an outbound call and I cannot hear anything when I place a call. In settings, Skype says that it cant find my speakers which is odd both in that no other application I use in Windows has any problem locating my
 speakers and putting sound through them. Also odd in that within the app, it seems to have found my speakers but just has decided to mute them. Oh, and all the sounds that Skype makes as it goes through the process of making the call produces all kinds of
 sounds that I can hear, just the part where you are listening to what the other end of the call is where Skype seems to have the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried all the solutions that exist on the internet for this problem including change the settings for suppressing background sounds and editing some Skype configuration file and either these don't work (as in the former case) or don't apply to my
 configuration (the latter). This is really obnoxious and annoying since I am paying for a monthly subscription that is completely useless. Even more annoying is that the only help that is available to fix the problem is from people volunteering their time
 so that in order to get a fix for a product that I am paying for I have to rely on the kindness of others.</p>

<h3> techaustinc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change a WPA2-Enterprise wireless network&#39;s saved password in Windows 10 without first connecting to that network and without recreating the network&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know how to change a saved password for a WPA2-ENTERPRISE wireless network in Windows 10 without first connecting to that network, and without completely removing and recreating the network connection?&nbsp; I am logging&nbsp;into the network using an
 assigned username/password which is entirely independent of my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I change my enterprise account password on the local network I am forced to delete and&nbsp;recreate the entire wireless network connection just to update the saved password.&nbsp; I know that if you can connect to the wireless network first you can edit
 the network's properties (and thus update the password), but I am unable to even connect to the wireless network in question - trying to connect simply fails because the saved password is outdated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any and all guidance.</p>

                    <p>I've just set up an email account using the Windows 10 mail app.&nbsp; My inbox has been fully synced and is showing all emails regardless of how long ago they were received (I updated the setting to say I wanted emails downloading from any time).&nbsp; My sent items
 folder however is only showing emails from the last month.&nbsp; Does anyone know how I can update the sent items folder so that it downloads everything?&nbsp; It's absolutely useless for my work emails until I can get this sorted!&nbsp; I'm starting to wish that&nbsp;I'd stuck
 with Windows 8...</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to</span><span> </span><span>run the <strong>PowerShell </strong>
commands by following the steps below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows <strong>PowerShell </strong>is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the
<strong>.NET Framework</strong>, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Open an Administrator command window by</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Right click </span></strong><span>on the taskbar and select
<strong>task manager</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on<strong> More details </strong>located at the bottom of the task manager window.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>File </strong>and select <strong>Run New Task</strong>. Make sure you have a check mark beside
<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong>CMD </strong></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the CMD Prompt:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: </span></strong><span>After running the above commands and it shows no remaining issues, run the below commands:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>powershell<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 4: </span></strong><span>Check to make sure the above command ran, shows a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 5: </span></strong><span>Check the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If not, <strong>restart</strong> the PC. In this case try as a new
<strong>Administrator user account</strong>. </span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue persist, I suggest you to

    <title>Bad Windows 8.1 update made it unbootable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodneyx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad Windows 8.1 update made it unbootable</h2>
                    I don't have any recovery media since I upgraded from 8 to 8.1 so Refresh won't work. I let it auto install updates and now it won't boot not even safe mode. I tried CMD prompt bootrec fixmbr etc. that didn't help. Viewing the file structure it appears
 the bad update changed drive letters so my Windows is now on F: and my C: has no Windows folder. I tried system file checker. I tried xcopy the Windows folder back to C: that didn't work. I tried using regedit to swap drive letters but that seemed to have
 no effect I think it might only have edited the recovery mode registry instead of my real one. How do I repair the boot structure to point to the proper windows folder and have all boot records correct?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand you are not able boot your Windows 8.1 computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the question below for further helps.<br />
1) </span>What happens when&nbsp;you try to boot the computer? Do you&nbsp;get any error message?</p>
<p><span>2) </span>When&nbsp;you says "Viewing the file structure it appears the bad update changed drive letters so my Windows is now on F: and my C: has no Windows folder." how&nbsp;you are viewing the file structure?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not possible that system drive later gets changed automatically by Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As of right now you are not able to go back to desktop screen. First, we need the computer to get back in right track.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, we need to create a Bootable Windows 8.1 DVD/CD or USB so that we can run a System recovery option from DVD or USB.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to the link given below to download Windows 8.1 ISO.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After creating Bootable USB/DVD, I would recommend you to run a Startup Repair from Window Recovery Environment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to the article mentioned below to run a Repair on your computer and refer to the section “To get to Windows Startup Settings in the Windows Recovery Environment”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And also if you have any System Restore point then you may restore your computer on a earlier time&nbsp; from Windows Recovery Environment when your computer works fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: </span>Windows automatically creates a restore point when you install desktop apps and new Windows updates, if the last restore point is older than 7 days. You can also create a restore point manually at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>System Restore disclaimer: </strong></span><span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you have installed after that date are removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful, if the issue persist please write us back with the information in brief so that we can assist you further.</span></p>

<p>I determined that in order to play DRM purchased video, you must have a WHQL certified driver installed. I was using a non-WHQL driver from NVidia (Beta). After removing this driver and installing the latest WHQL driver, I was able to get video to play.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10, Taskbar frozen</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 Pro N (from 8.1 Pro N), and I cannot use the taskbar... It is completely frozen, I cannot click on it (so no start menu, no icon, nothing... ). Also, I cannot use shortcut such as Windows+R or Windows+X, nothing shows up...
 It is really annoying!</p>

            <p>There is a fairly easy but temporary fix for the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever the Taskbar freezes</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> to open Task Manager</p>
<p>2. Under the Head "<strong>Windows Processes</strong>" of the Processes Menu find Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>3. Click on it and then Click on Restart button on the bottom right.</p>
<p>4. In a few seconds Explorer restarts and Taskbar starts working again.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons why Windows Taskbar freezes. Before we proceed, we would like to confirm if you have already tried
<strong>restarting Windows Explorer</strong> as suggested by <strong>ArchitKhandelwal</strong> on
<strong>February 8, 2017</strong>. If the issue persists, you can follow the methods provided below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Use Powershell</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Powershell command to unfreeze the frozen taskbar by following the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press and hold the <strong>Windows logo</strong> key + <strong>
R</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <strong><em>powershell</em></strong> in the <strong>Run dialog box</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type the following command line: <strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note that you have to enable the <strong>Windows Firewall</strong> before performing the task above. Here are the steps on how to check if the Windows Firewall was enabled:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63pt"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63pt"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <strong>More Details</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63pt"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select the <strong>Services</strong> tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63pt"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Make sure that <strong><em>MpsSvc</em></strong>, also described as
<strong>Windows Firewall, is running</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Enable the User Manager.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A disabled User Manager sometimes results in a frozen Windows taskbar. To re-enable the User Manager, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.5pt"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press and hold <strong>Windows logo</strong> key + <strong>R</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.5pt"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <strong><em>services.msc</em></strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.5pt"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Double-click the <strong>User Manager</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.5pt"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Set the <strong>Startup type</strong> to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.5pt"><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Hit <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.5pt"><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong>Restart</strong> the computer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Disable Recently Opened Items.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Disabling the recently opened items helps to speed up the list launch. To disable items that are recently opened, follow the instruction below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 67.5pt"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 67.5pt"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select <strong>Personalization</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 67.5pt"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 67.5pt"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Slide the toggle button beside <strong><span>Show recently opened items in Jump Lists on Star or the taskbar</span></strong> to turn it off.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you need additional assistance.</p>

<p>Because I didn't enjoy NV as much as I enjoyed FO3 I haven't bothered to download any of the dlc's for NV, but I might get this one.</p>
<p>Really liked the trailer!</p>

<h2>            Xbox Game Pass Quests - Microsoft Rewards</h2>
                    <p>I've been having issues with the Quests on the Xbox Rewards app. My partner can see/complete the quests however none are showing for me. Another family member (not part of my family group) is also having the same issue. A quick online search and it would
 seem many others are also experiencing issues!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been able to see anything mentioned from MS regarding these issues. I have contacted support who've asked for screenshots etc however I haven't heard anything back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Posting in the hope that someone has been able to find a fix?</p>

            It is a widespread issue. Microsoft is definitely aware about it by now with all the reports I've seen about it, but they haven't commented on it yet, they've also been locking threads related to it due to all the new threads popping up related to the
 issue. Not sure what's going on. Some transparency would be appreciated. Here's hoping a fix is on the way. I use the rewards I get to purchase game pass, without the rewards I can't afford it. :(

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Is it greyed out in System icon settings?
<br />Also, did you make sure it isn't hidden in the taskbar with ^?

            Hi markvalpreda
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />When you said you make sure it the icon wasn't turned off did you do it from start - settings - personalization - taskbar - select which icons appear on the taskbar?
<br />
<br />Do you see it in there and it is on?
<br />If so, This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<p>Correct. No icons are hidden, I like to have all of them displayed. Not greyed out in system icon settings, I can turn it on and off.....but nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the commands came back with no changes. With 1903 coming soon so I might wait and see if that upgrade helps. Otherwise I'll probably just do a fresh install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is interesting is if I am in turn system icons on of off, and I turn off network, the volume disappears from the system tray. If I toggle volume, volume disappears from the system tray.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a total of 13 icons in the system tray when I have the taskbar 'single' layer. If I change it to 'double' layer - unlock taskbar and drag it up one 'notch', I only see 12 icons (stacked 6 wide by 2 lines), same at 'triple' layer with 4 wide by 3 lines.
 Still never see the network icon.&nbsp;</p>

            yeah that is some corruption somewhere.
<br />Update might work or like you said a reset should do it.

            Hello markvalpreda, 
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question. 
<br />
<br />Open Registry Editor by running regedit command.
<br />
<br />Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer.
<br />
<br />In right pane of Explorer, right click and select New &gt; DWORD and name it as HideSCANetwork.
<br />
<br />Let the Value data of HideSCANetwork set to 0.
<br />
<br />Close Registry Editor and reboot the machine.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Upgraded to 1903 in the Slow Ring, no change. I did the registry entry, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did change my scaling from 110% to 100% and it came back. I changed the scaling to 115% and it was there. Changed to 110% and it was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure how to report that, but scaling at 110% caused the wifi/network icon to not show up in the system tray.&nbsp;</p>

            Yup, scaling at 110% also causes this to disappear for me. Changing to a different level fixes the problem here as well.

Please report the complete error message, as well as the steps you take to make the error occur.&nbsp; Please do not paraphrase.<br />
<br />
What version of Windows do you have, including service pack (if not sure:&nbsp; Start &gt; Run &gt; winver &gt; OK)<br />
<br />
What happened to your system just before this behavior started?<br />
<br />
What antivirus application do you have installed?&nbsp; Is its subscription current?&nbsp; Was the subscription ever permitted to lapse?<br />

            By default, administrators and power users <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> have the ability to change the system time.<br />
<br />
"You cannot set the date, time, or time zone on your computer"<br />
&nbsp; &lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/300022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/300022</a> &gt;<br />
<br />
If you can't change the time and you are an administrator, then to me that points either to a piece of Malware on your machine or perhaps your machine is XP Pro and either is or once was a member of a Domain where this privilege was removed for administrators.<br />
<br />
If you do have XP Pro, going from memery, I believe you can reassign yourself the SeSystemtimePrivilege by using the Group Policy Editor&nbsp; (Start -&gt; Run -&gt;&nbsp; "gpedit.msc")<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, or you have XP Home, you will need to download and install the XP Resource Kit and use the "NTRights.exe" program therein to reassign yourself SeSystemtimePrivilege.<br />
<br />
XP Resource Kit:&nbsp; &lt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17657</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Yet another, and maybe simpler approach altogether would be hit the key specified at the first splash screen that comes up when you reboot your machine that gets you into "BIOS Settings" (or similar) and reset the time in the BIOS before subsequently booting
 the machine to Windows.<br />
