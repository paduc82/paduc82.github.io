<h2>            How do I select multiple files in a row at the same time in Win10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I need to know how to select multiple files that are in a row at one time?
</p>
<p>It use to be select first file, then hold down the shift button, then select the last file. Then all files were selected in blue highlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the same functions work in gmail as Windows10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I have a similar problem. since upgrading to windows 10 the HP Support assistant installs on my computer but will not open. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it to no avail. I am using an HP Pavilions dv7-3188cl. 64 bit OS. processor is Intel Core i5.</p>
<p>prior to downloading the updated Support assistant to work with the windows upgrade the older support assistant worked. now I only get an install and then nothing happens when I open it.

            <p>I have the same exact problem. I upgraded from win 8.1 to win 10 on an HP stream 11 and now when i click on HP support assistant it doesn't work... it doesn't launch. Tried all the suggested fixes.. I reinstalled it dozens of times, restarted etc. It installs
 fine but doesn't launch after double clicking it. The site is also not able to read my computer to look at my model number like it can normally with the HP software ( the framework) that supports it.&nbsp; It's like their software doesn't work on win 10 upgrade,
 at least on my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I noticed is if I right click it and do compatibility trouble shooting, it will not work on windows 8 either and when i send I finally send it to microsoft they return an "incompatible program" detected</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that mean HP support assistant is known to not work on Windows 10 or just that it can't work in compatible mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other program that functions similarly? Windows update seems to offer much less control of optional, recommended updates. I don't know if it is accessing hp updates. I actually manually installed one driver update but this is tedious.

            <p>I have experienced exactly the same issue. When I try to remove the HP Support Assistance I get the fault information: "The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable". The failed path indicated is:
</p>
<p><span>C:\ProgramData\{18165758-115C-4DC0-9EC2-FF89F725767F}\
</span></p>
<p>When I try to download the HP Support assistant from Internet then I finally get the fault information: "Error 1714. The older version o the HP Support Assistant cannot be removed. Contact the technical support Group."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the Microsoft- and the HP Technical support teams in Sweden have adviced me back port to Windows8 and then upgrade again. This advice is not acceptable for me since it is extremely time consuming and painful in general. There must be a way to solve
 this easily reproducable problem analytically&nbsp;from either HP or Microsoft resulting in a patch.</p>

            <p>Okay so I tried to see what was going on with the HP support assistant by using the "event viewer" in Windows but then that started giving me weird error messages itself and it would not work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So instead of going crazy trying to figure out the cause of all these issues I decided to do a Windows 10 reset from the Update and Security/Recovery section of Windows 10 in Settings and opted for it to reset and delete my files and settings (not the option
 to wipe the drive for computer disposal). There is also an option to reset Windows 10 and keep all your files but I decided I wanted to start from scratch with Windows 10 since I did not have a lot on the pc anyway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved some files I wanted to keep to a USB flash drive first. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It took about 45 minutes to complete the reset. It's almost like doing a clean install... you have to fill out the basic info after Windows 10 resets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it started up I did some windows updates and installed some programs and changed some privacy settings and then&nbsp;installed the HP Support Assistant and it installed and launched fine. It found a couple of drivers for me to install and I installed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 seems to be running well now.</p>

            <p>Had that problem yesterday after I restored my Hp Envy 2. Reinstalled, and whereas it no longer crashes, it also doesn't seem to be working. All I get is the white logo saying HP Support Assistant, and nothing else. I've run it twice, letting it run for
 quite a while each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's actually running and scanning/doing a thing, it bloody well best show something as a form of user feedback mechanism. You know, a bar or even just text that says I AM RUNNING!</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP is so bad at this.</p>

<h2>            Projector skeleton has stopped working</h2>
                    I am trying to run "Safecracker" in compatibility mode in Windows Vista, and I checked the compatibility page and it says it should work, however after the credits, right before the game should start i get the Projector skeleton has stopped working message.
 Any Ideas? Thanks.

<h2>            Windows 7 backup is larger that total information on my &#39;C&#39; drive</h2>
                    &nbsp;I just migrated from Vista to Windows 7. Under V ista I used Windows 'One Care' for backups to an external hard drive.&nbsp; Using OC and taking the default to let OC select the files to backup , my backup file was around 30 Gig.&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after migrating
 to 7 I took a backup to a clean hard disk and the size of the backup was 72.4 Gig...&nbsp; ???&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, my 'C' drive which contains all my dataplus programs, etc. is only 70.2 Gig.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Why is the backup so large?&nbsp; and 2) Why over twice the size of the backup generated
 by Microsoft's 'One Care' program.&nbsp; <br />

<p>I'm having a similar problem.&nbsp; After finding the Windows 7&nbsp;"Backup and Restore"&nbsp;was amazingly slow, I updated using the recommended hotfix.&nbsp; Now the backup runs fast enough to complete overnight, but the size of the backup is about 75% larger than the orginal
 the hotfix.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if Windows 7 backup is doing an incremental backup or just adding another copy.&nbsp;&nbsp; At over 800Gb, my 1Tb disk cannot hold multiple copies.&nbsp; Is there a way to force an incremental backup?</p>

<p>To properly get answers to your post you should include some minimum information.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Device type. ie PC, Laptop, Tablet, Surface.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Who made it and model.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; OS type, Home, Pro, Enterprise, etc<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Current build.&nbsp; Go Settings, System. About. OS build XXXXXX.XXXX</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Do you know how to get to the BIOS? Enter, F1, F12.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You need to get to the Boot Manager to get the proper device at the top of the list that has the C: drive in it.</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Then you can boot up.</p>

<p>5. I know&nbsp;how to get to Bios. I'll try to install Windows 10 after disconnecting old HDD. You see that presently I have W10 installed on my old HDD. Should I uninstall it before installing it on my SSD? Wouldn't be a problem if, even for a short time, I'll
 appear to Microsoft with two W 10 OS's at the same time? (knowing I am a Windows Insider?)</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            I tried to install it, but failed. First, Bios has taken much more time to boot, and, after the setup finally started, at the first restart, setup started again, over and over. What have I done wrong?&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 UI is UGLY and BORING&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 10 UI is less than impressive when it comes to look and feel. Windows 10 seems to be a good operating system. However, you would think that Microsoft could do much more to impress the eye when it comes to the UI of this OS. Windows Vista was
 hands down the best looking OS even though it had it's own issues. Windows 7 was basically the same look as vista minus some of the Vista UI appeal. Even Windows 8.1 had better looking icons than Windows 10. I wish that Microsoft would make Windows 10 look
 better. The dull UI makes Windows 10 a very boring experience to use. I bought my new PC with Windows 10 Pro and felt like it was a major downgrade from my old Windows 7 Pro PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else think that the Windows 10 UI is ugly and boring?</p>

            I know right, compared to mac os, the windows ui looks like a boring, flat, unfinished android app. Since they realesed the new 'fluent' design language tehy started including the acrylic stuff, but still its used very little, mac os is bombarded with
 acrylic adn its so much beautiful. If only gaming on linux was good, i would 100% change to linux than staying with windows. I would appreciate it is tasbar was like the menu bar on mac os, and fonts where smoother, overall scaling was smaller natively, because
 its so big.&nbsp;

<p>Agreed. Mac OS is much better looking that Windows 10. Personally I think that Windows 10 is one of the ugliest versions of Windows ever produced. Windows Vista was hands down the best looking version of Windows and Windows 7 is much more pleasing to the
 eye than Windows 10. I just think that Microsoft is taking their OS backwards instead of forwards. Now that Microsoft isn't supporting the newer processors with anything other than Windows 10 everyone will be forced to use Windows 10 sooner than later. I know
 that there are many more people out there that think the same way about how ugly Windows 10 is. If you see below is a look at Vista. Yes, Vista was not the best OS, but it was beautiful. It just proves that Microsoft can make a beautiful OS. Why can't Windows
 10 look this good?</p>

<p>I totaly agree with you. Windows 10 UI was 'too awsome' until the entire OS can't run on my PC(my PC was HP Mini). I working on my 'touch-friendy UI experiments' see that 60% of Windows 10 UI are not touch-friendly at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week i emulate Mac OS X on VM and after that 80% of everyday my PC time is done playing Mac OS X on VM. I totaly agree if WinX_03 said that Mac OS is more better that Windows 10 because the UI was so boring and dull.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found this issue with Windows 10 UI.</p>

</p><p>1. Windows 10 requise a high-end graphic card to run well due to the UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Some custom color that can natively support on Windows 8.1 was not supported on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Some old game (like Microsoft Pinball Arcade) are not run properly when trasparent is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So........any comment?</p>

 its used very little, mac os is bombarded with acrylic adn its so much beautiful. If only gaming on linux was good, i would 100% change to linux than staying with windows. I would appreciate it is tasbar was like the menu bar on mac os, and fonts where smoother,
 overall scaling was smaller natively, because its so big.&nbsp; </blockquote>

<p>Regardless of what has happened, it is against the forum rules to call out other users even if you believe them to be stealing accounts.&nbsp; As for your own account there is nothing you can do, you need to wait until support finishes their investigation.</p>
<p>You're also not giving us the full details of how your account was stolen, I can tell you now though that it was NOT hacked, as it's not possible to hack accounts, there are many ways to lose your account, hacking is&nbsp;not one of them.</p>

<h2>            cannot revert back to previous window 10 version</h2>
                    I want to revert back to my previous windows version so I can turn on back up cause when I installed this new upgrade creator 10 it shows my windows 10 old folder but I have no saved information and documents in it with my older version of Office 2007
 and it will not allow me to access my documents telling me I have no permission, I went to Settings - accounts-recovery but it tells me I must delete my account to continue and there is no option to do as is written so I go to advance-restore to previous and
 all it says is click on your account but the window freezes and you do not even have keyboard function or a curer to click your present account to get started, this is disgusting.&nbsp;

 is the message I got when I open Settings, Update &amp; Security, Recovery. Also for a last resort, I tried System Restore but that failed and retained my present OS [ Creator Version ] 1709 build 16299.19 As stated earlier in my post, I tried advance and when
 it proceeded through it's program, I could not select the stated " BLUECARS Mopar " showing cause the keyboard function and curser was not working and I had to do a hard shutdown and reboot. I only selected this version as it said my PC was accepted for the
 reality hardware feature which it turned out lacking major hardware such a direct x and the advance display adapter and a few more even though I had the memory and CPU storage space. I just want to go back to my previous OS Windows 10 so I can create a Back
 up and a image file then I will probably download the creator version after getting more hardware for the reality feature

            I am hoping this process and your " Fix " is being given the highest priority cause not just me but millions of other users are now lost with losing valuable files that cannot be viewed even in the windows old folder with documents being locked out or
 being told we as administrators are being denied and that process should be completely eradicated not to even allow a administrator access to his or her own files and works. We subscribers depend on you programmers and designers and system administrators to
 check all aspects of any type release for bugs before you release it to a world audience who depend on your accuracy. I am also frustrated as I have one drive set to auto upload documents to my available storage and even in the cloud there were none of my
 files or present documents. <br />

            Please, can you resolve this bug immediately. I just went to my contact list in my default mail application and all is blank. This is crazy. How do you put out a upgrade that erases almost everything and then state you are aware of it and your engineers
 are working on a bug fix. This was my personal information that is now lost in the present but is still available hopefully if you can allow me to roll back to my previous windows 10 edition. I did not upgrade om my laptop so I should have my contacts still
 there.

    <title>Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600 Stops Responding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott inrig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600 Stops Responding</h2>
                    <p>There is a similarly titled issue already in the Community posts, but the behavior in my case is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the 600 keyboard on a machine running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Now and then, the keyboard just randomly stops working.&nbsp; No keys have any effect; even the "Num Lock" key does not change the state of the corresponding indicator light.&nbsp; The only way to get the
 keyboard working again is to remove power from it, by unplugging its cable or by powering off the machine.&nbsp; I have seen posts on the net reporting keyboard problems with certain gaming software, but I have no such software on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I got my current machine, my wife used this same keyboard unit on her Windows 7 computer without ever encountering this problem, so I would think it's not a hardware failure in the keyboard itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to what may be wrong?&nbsp; I hesitate to replace the keyboard (which I quite like) with an identical model when I don't know where the fault lies.</p>

    <title>WHY IS WINDOWS 10 SO SLOW - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uncle zeb  say:</h3>
<h2>            WHY IS WINDOWS 10 SO SLOW</h2>
                    <p>Hello ,first of all i would advise anyone still considering the upgrade&nbsp; to Windows 10&nbsp; DO NOT DO IT !! . If you are really desperate to try it out wait a few weeks or maybe months until a lot of problems with it are solved .If you install it now be prepared
 for the real possibility of&nbsp; a lot of problems . I have installed Windows 10&nbsp; (and have regretted it ) on 2 computers , 1 laptop and one desktop .Both of them are now running very ,very slowly . Anything i do be it trying to open files ,apps&nbsp; connecting to
 the web takes an absolute age . Both were slow when running Windows 8.1 (i think W8.1 slower than Win7 ) but this latest effort is making the simplest of tasks so slow the computers are almost unusable .&nbsp; This is not a isolated problem but indeed seems to
 be&nbsp; a very common complaint with those who have struggled to get it installed . It seems that both new and older devices are affected so the age of the hardware cannot be solely blamed making thing run so slowly .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Zeb</p>

            <p>Interesting, after 10-15 years not even the MS support engineers (are they really engineers?) use the CP category view.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process Explorer is still a good program.&nbsp; Use it to look for processes and drivers that are hogging the CPU.&nbsp; The Intel Rapid Storage Technology program was using 25% of the CPU after the upgrade(?) to 10.&nbsp; Fixed that but the computer is still SLOW!&nbsp; About
 to run Process Monitor to see what's really going on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I plan to revert to 7.&nbsp; Hope you all have a W7 image, just in case the downgrade (speed up, is what I call it) doesn't work.&nbsp;

            <p>I am experiencing this isse too. &nbsp;System was working perfectly and flying along on my new ssd drive but problems started when I right-clicked an image to edit. &nbsp;Started to go slow and took an eternity to shut down. &nbsp;Rebooted and incredibly slow boot and
 system is now unusable. &nbsp;The troubleshooter is searching for packs but at this rate will take literally days to load. I wasn't aware of any updates since the problem started although have read there could be Nvidia driver conflicts causex by updates? I'm using
 a 930 OC GPU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway I hope someone can find a resolution soon...&nbsp;</p>

            I have done as you suggested and there is no change in the speed of my computer. I am a teacher and rely heavily on my laptop to put my lessons and materials together for my students. This is completely unacceptable, we are 1 week out from starting school
 and I cannot properly prepare because my computer takes a ridiculous amount of time to load anything. As others have mentioned, this has left my laptop unusable.&nbsp; Please provide a different solution or a way to revert to Windows 8. Thank you.<br />

                    Some of the live tiles on the start screen ghost or shadow onto other tiles not necessarily the tile next to it but others as well.&nbsp; Some of the tiles have vertical bars and lines on them.&nbsp; For example, some of the purple tiles have pink vertical bars
 or lines or both.&nbsp; Reds have dark, some blue tiles have light bars or lines.&nbsp; Not all tiles do this.&nbsp; There are many that are normal.&nbsp; Also some background areas that are supposed to be black are a mix of rust color and black squares.&nbsp; I tried refreshing the

    <title>Skype video call issue&#58; my video is large by default, in every - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vaibshah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype video call issue&#58; my video is large by default, in every call.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the latest Skype version (8.41.0.54) on my Windows 10. </p>
<p>Since last couple of weeks, every time I do a video call, my video size is full, by default, while the other person's video is very small. Why would I want to see myself bigger and the other person small (thumbnail)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking for solutions online, I found some thread where people actually demanded this (really unbelievable to me). Now, it seems the developers have done this hard-coded. Be that as it may, since you have users with different needs, could you please add
 an option in the Audio Video Settings to set a default option where I can set whose video should be large by default, mine or the other person's?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because as it happens now, every time after starting a video call, I have to wait till the other person's video appears, and then drag their video to the center (to make our videos equal sized), and then drag my video to the top to make it thumbnail sized.
 Isn't it possible to set this as a default setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking forward to this update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! </p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, if the person whom you have video called answers the call with audio only, then their avatar image will be shown in a small circle in the upper right corner. When
 they eventually enable video on their side, their video will still be shown in a small circle in the upper corner, while yours in the large screen. In this case, the only what you can do is exactly what you did, i.e. to drag and drop their small video image
 to the middle of the screen and then drag your own half part to the upper right corner. This behaviour is by design.</span></span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The beeping means there is a hardware issue with your computer. So you need to<br />
check with the System Maker's Support or a real computer shop (one that does its<br />
own in-shop service).<br />
<p><br />
The beeping sounds are error codes which describe an issue with your machine. <br />
One constant beep&nbsp;can mean keyboard (loose cord or bad), loose card, power, a <br />
short or other issue depending on System/BIOS maker. Other beep patterns have <br />
other meanings depending on the maker of the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Bootup and select SETUP/SETTINGS (BIOS/CMOS) - usually F2 as you start up - <br />
look to see BIOS creator then refer here :<br />

    <title>Use of pre-owned licenses - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Use of pre-owned licenses</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
i am looking for experiences with using pre-owned licenses. It seems possible to buy and sell licenses (volume licenses) based on the UsedSoft-Oracle case, so basically there is a possibility to buy "2nd hand licenses" for much less then new.<br />
<br />
Anybody any (legal) views on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Uppie<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We don't give legal&nbsp;advice here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can&nbsp;give you&nbsp;general rules about Licensing, as you are not specific in your question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Computer/Laptop came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc), that Product Key that came with the Laptop is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>The same applies to System Builder's OEM Licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines and System Builder's OEM Licenses) is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowd to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>And Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div><strong>Q.</strong> <span>If my customer asks me to upgrade a PC with new hardware components, when is a new operating system needed? When would the PC be considered "new"?</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computer‚Äî<strong><em>except</em> the motherboard</strong>‚Äîand still retain the licence for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software. If the
 motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect, then a new computer has been created. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the licence of new operating system software is required.</p>
<p>If the motherboard is replaced because it is defective, you do <em>not</em> need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC
<strong>as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined by the manufacturer's warranty.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you reinstall the OEM License&nbsp;on another Computer, you have&nbsp;replaced the Motherboard, haven't you?.</p>
<p>It gets complicated, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Nein ist es nicht. Weil auf die Xbox.com Website *jeder* zugreifen kann und unendlich viele Silberaccounts kostenlos anlegen kann.

<p>Mag ja sein. Aber daf√ºr musst Du dann die Konsole verwenden, und musst einen Menschen dran setzen, der jeden einzelnen Spieler "von Hand" zuspammed. Der Kosten/Nutzen Faktor ist hier unvorteilhaft f√ºr den Spammer, weil er die
 Nachrichten einzeln von Hand verfassen muss, und eine Multi-Nachricht nur an 99 Leute aus der Freundesliste schicken kann.</p>
<p>Ein Computerscript an die Website anzusetzen und automatisiert Millionen von Usern anzuschreiben ist ja das, was es f√ºr den Spammer interessant machen w√ºrde.</p>

            <p>There's not much you can do in that case.&nbsp; Usually, a computer sold from a company like HP is only guaranteed to work with the version of Windows that it came with.&nbsp; In fact in most cases, upgrading to another version of Windows also voids your warranty
 (but it's never stopped me -- I upgraded my Asus laptop from Vista &gt; 7 &gt; 8 &gt; 8.1... it had a long life).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In fact, my Asus laptop is a great example. It had an NVidia graphics card inside it. Asus and NVidia both provides Vista drivers, but never created anything newer.&nbsp; Fortunately the old Vista drivers installed and work just fine in Windows 7, 8, and 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So you might try just using the newest driver available.&nbsp; It's basically your only option, but it's also "at your own risk".</p>

            Then HP does not support your system overall under Windows 8 and would suggest you attempt to visit the manufacturer of your video device's support web pages and download a Windows 8/8.1 driver - if THEY support that particular video device under Windows
 8/8.1...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Looks like an nVidia device or Intel device...<br />
