<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit to Win 10 pro 64 bit upgrade issues</h2>
                    <p>Here's my system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit to Win 10 pro 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS Sabertooth 990fx R2 mobo</p>
<p>AMD FX 8350 8 core 4.01 ghz processor</p>
<p>32gig of ram</p>
<p>a 250gig Kingston SSD SATA Drive(the c: drive...aka drive 0)</p>
<p>a 3TB Western Digital SATA Drive (the d: drive...aka drive 1)</p>
<p>an LG BlueRay DVD R</p>
<p>a blueray player (not sure of the brand)</p>
<p>AMD Radeon R9 200 series video card</p>
<p>Netgear WNDA3100v3 wireless adapter</p>
<p>Creative SB X-Fi Titanium Fatality sound card</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So here are my issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First...when Windows 10 upgraded...instead of installing on my C drive...an SSD that had plenty of room on it, it installed on my other drive, totally nuking the 2 partitions on it and destroying all of my data.&nbsp; I lost everything...documents, pictures,
 music, everything.&nbsp; Why did it even touch that drive?&nbsp; It never asked me to do anything with that drive.&nbsp; **** MS?&nbsp; I am a very pissed off camper over that.&nbsp; I lost a lot of important documents thanks to this momentus amount of stupidty on your part.&nbsp; I purposely
 have my data on a separate disk, away from the OS...so I don't have to worry about backing it up when I install or reinstall an OS.&nbsp; Usually I get to choose where it is installed and what&nbsp;it does to any of my drives.&nbsp; **** is up with destroying partitions on
 a drive without even asking?&nbsp; I am so fracking pissed off about this right now.&nbsp; This is on top of all of the other issues I have been having as listed below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I do the upgrade.&nbsp; The first time I did it, I did it with the ISO on a dvd.&nbsp; I get to the solid blue login screen...I enter my password...either hit enter or click the next button and it just hangs.&nbsp; Eventually when I click around it just fades to white
 and reboots.&nbsp; Same thing happens if I click on the "I am not &lt;username&gt;" link or the accessability icon.&nbsp; Apparently there should be a power icon near the next button...but that is not present.&nbsp; SO I reboot and run the DVD and go to repair.&nbsp; If I try the reset
 and keep my files, I get an error message saying that the drive is locked so it cannot reset (I have no idea on how to unlock it).&nbsp; If I try the full reset, it says a partition is missing so it cannot reset.&nbsp; If I try to do a startup repair, it doesn't work
 either.&nbsp;At one point I got to a screen that listed the available Wireless Access points.&nbsp; I clicked on my&nbsp;AP and it just hung and eventually rebooted.&nbsp; I also went into the Install section and I tried to install on my Drive 0 and it sad something about an
 mbr partition for EFI...I don't remember the exact message...but it seemed like something was not right.&nbsp; The setup looked the same as what was installed with Win 7.&nbsp;So I called tech support and we went through all of this and couldn't figure anything out.&nbsp;
 So the tech support guy told me to reinstall windows 7.&nbsp; I went and did this...this is when I found out that the install nuked the 2 partitions on drive 1 and I lost all of my data grrrr...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I install win 7 again...do all of the upgrades...installed the drivers for mobo, sound and video...got all of the windows updates...Windows update says I am up to date and I do not see the Win 10 icon coming up.&nbsp; SO I looked this up on the MS site and
 the tool says that it is not up to date.&nbsp; SO I went through the update list to see if there were any failed updates.&nbsp; I fixed the ones that weren't already fixed...still no icon.&nbsp; SO I looked up why it is not coming up and found a registry fix that forces
 the issue...it comes up and I do the upgrade via windows update.&nbsp; I go through the same process and I am still at the same point I was above.&nbsp; It freezes at the blue login screen.&nbsp; Still no working Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just for sh**s and giggles, I just installed it fresh.&nbsp; It installs and now I cannot see my ssd drive (drive 0)...it doesn't come up in drive management or the device manager...but otherwise, everything else looks fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what do I do to fix the issues with the upgrade process?&nbsp; Why was windows update saying I was updated when the Win 10 compatibility tool ( I think that was what it was called) said the reason I couldn't get Win 10 was because I wasn't updated?&nbsp; is there
 anything I can do to make sure windows is actually checking everything to make sure that it is properly?&nbsp; I can't imagine that is the problem.&nbsp; There was no safe mode I could go into to check and see why it was crashing and rebooting at the login screen&nbsp; I
 would really like to get this upgraded so I can get my system back up.&nbsp; I have been down for 3 days now.&nbsp; I am a web developer and really need to get this back up and running so I can get back to doing work.&nbsp; I really need a working system.&nbsp; HELP!!!!</p>

            Hello,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you start the Windows 10 installation from the boot environment?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to perform check disk from advanced recovery options. Check if it helps.
<div>a) Insert the media such as (USB or DVD) and restart the computer.</div>
<div>b) Press F12 key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.</div>
<div>c) Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</div>
<div>d) Click Next and select Repair your computer.</div>
<div>e) You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. </div>
<div>f) Choose the option Troubleshoot and select Advanced options.</div>
<div>g) You may choose Command Prompt from Advanced boot option.</div>
<div>h) In the command prompt, type ‘chkdsk /r’ and press Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Hope the information helps to fix the issue, if you have any further queries, feel free to post. We are here to assist you.</p>

            <p>That didn't work. Every time i tried that i got errors.&nbsp; A reset, keeping my files said the drive was locked and a full reset said it was missing a needed partition.&nbsp; If i tried a startup repair, it said it couldn't repair it. What turned out to be the problem
 was my USB Wifi Adapter...Netgear WNDA3100v3 wireless adapter.&nbsp; Once I pulled that out, the upgrade went though without a hitch.&nbsp; This should have had better error recovery so I could see that it was a problem with a USB device or with this specific device.&nbsp;
 There needs to be some logging that i can see, perhaps via the install disk, to see what the problem is.&nbsp; It took 5 days of talking to Tech Support on the phone, who was utterly clueless...so i got handed off to level 2, who still has yet to call me back (they
 were supposed to call me Friday) and me randomness running across an article online stating that there may be issues with USB devices in the upgrade that caused me to remove the WIFI adapter.&nbsp; Windows installed just fine with the adapter in when I did a fresh
 install, so it wasn't immediately obvious that was the issue.&nbsp; I am not very impressed with Microsoft support.&nbsp; I am glad that I really don;t need to use it much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that problem was resolved.&nbsp; I would still like to know why the upgrade process decided to go to the other dive and nuke the partitions there, thus destroying years of docs, pics, and data without even asking if it was ok to do so.&nbsp; There was still 233
 gb of drive space on my drive 0...a Kingston SSD drive.&nbsp; That is where Win 7 was installed.&nbsp; There was no reason for Windows to destroy the partitions on drive 1 and try to install there.</p>

            Is there a way to download the games you want from your computer? Because I think you can just get the games you want from your computer, then go on your xbox to start downloading.<br />

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t download Saints Row 1</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Back in febraury, I purchased Saints Row but can't download the game. I already did the instructions about problems with downloading games in my xbox 360 but it keeps saying "Can't download Saints Row" after having 85% downloaded.</p>
<p>It is almost 2 months now, trying to download the game, doing all instructions of the support and no success.</p>
<p>Can anybody help me with this? I starting to think that the file of the game is corrupted or something that cannot be downloaded.</p>
<p>Sorry if my english is no good and Thanks!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that is probably the issue. Some content can only be downloaded if your account region matches your physical location. The system may have seen that you were purchasing from the US, where the game is available, but didn't recognize an issue
 until it checked your IP during download.</p>

<h2>            windows 7 my guest account corrupt</h2>
                    <p>Im set up as an adminstrator on windows 7 </p>
<p>I clicked on Guest account and I was tired but somehow the system was saying that I was getting permenent access to the Guest folders and the&nbsp;system was showing progress show&nbsp;progress along the&nbsp;address bar.</p>
<p>I paniced and cancelled.</p>
<p>I then tried to delete the Guest account thinking that if I did that I could restore it from backup but the system said that I did not have access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I go into the Guest acount now it takes ages to start up and says that it has given me a temporary profile and some programme I think its Nickon Zoom Browser says that it has problems starting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can you advise if and how I can restore the system&nbsp;back to how as it was before i messed it up, many thanks.</p>

Sorry to hear you're having an issue with the HDMI connection. What is the resolution set to on the Surface for your TV that you are connected to?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>What resolution is your TV? 720p or 1080p? Can you change the mode/resolution?</p>
<p>After you connect to your TV:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span>Devices</span>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Second screen</span> and then choose&nbsp;the Second screen only option.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>You can try messing with the your screen resolution in Control Panel on Surface, but it sounds like you've already done that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>Not sure if this is related, but</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a similar problem when I connected to a large monitor with DVI.... exact same error message...&nbsp;but VGA worked great.... maybe that is why the official Microsoft adaptor is vga and not dvi.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought both adaptors from other vendors... I haven't adjusted the plastic casing to be on an angle yet for a better fit with the edge of the surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is a software issue.</p>
<p>The digital out doesn't reformat the start screen properly on the new monitor like the vga one does. The vga reformats the number of live tiles in each column to look great.</p>
<p>The dvi tries to keep the exact same formatting and when the ratio or pixels don't fit, it errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello JBrandonPowell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you adjust your screen resolution to the highest, it may not meet the minimum requirements to run Metro apps. Metro apps require a resolution of at least 1024 pixels by 768 pixels.</p>

</p><blockquote>Hi Xavier , <br />

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did. And Newtek says I'm not the first one asking this and that the development of the Skype side, is indeed on Skype's behalf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the answer from Newtek:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(192, 192, 192, 1)">This is how Skype TX operates. The video call is what is available as a full screen video, having secondary channels are not
 available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(192, 192, 192, 1)">
<div style="font-style: italic">
<div>
<div>What do you suggest we can tell "our" interviewees to do, when they need to share their presentations back with us? Do you have any workaround?<br />
<br />
Skype TX should be easy for the remote end to join in such as Skype is. Are there any plans on moving forward with this?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Who's developing this, NewTek or Skype?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. Regards, Xavier V.</div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(192, 192, 192, 1)">Anything that is within the Skype call itself is handled by the Skype team at Microsoft. You aren't the first to ask for this,
 Microsoft would have to add it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So this is currently a limitation on Skype TX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, back to my question, how can we have our interviewees share their screens/presentations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Xavier V.</p>

            I'm sorry but if you want to use third-party software with only partial Skype supporting you are limited with this software possibilities.

</p><p>So as you see, no one is using any third party.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now back to my question: how can the remote end (using skype) can share his screen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - I'm sure you know that Skype natively supports the screen sharing feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Xv</p>

<p>Yes you are wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Newtek "puts" the Skype TX in their hardware just like Skype and it's partnership agrees to.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t update and can&#39;t detect new driver updates.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Months ago I updated my computer from Windows 7 Home Premium too Windows 10. But because I didn't really like Windows 10 I took the free "roll-back" too my old Windows 7. Nothing was wrong with that, till I decided that I should check Windows 10 out (again)
 after a few months people were saying that a lot of things were improved. So, I updated again, and just like the first time I still didn't think that Windows 10 was worth it and I decided that I want go back again, but the Roll-back function wasn't there anymore
 (I only had Windows 10 two days, so the roll-back before 30 days (trial) should be there), but it cleary was not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Because I couldn't go back too Windows 7 Home Premium on the normal way I decided too get a ISO of Windows 7 Home Premium. I made a bootable DVD / CD and installed Windows 7 Home Premium with succes on my computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But I still have some problems, and with this problems I can't really use my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem one.</strong><br />
1) The screen doesn't fill up the whole monitor. So basically there is a black border around my screen of 2-4cm.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Problem two.</strong></p>
<p>2) When I search for Windows Updates it loads forever, let it searched for hours. After a fresh install I always got 100+ updates, but this time not because Windows Updates search forever.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think that the second problem can be the cause of the first problem. Because maybe the first problem needs correct drivers. And Windows Updates search for these drivers. (But I never ever had this black border before with fresh installs so I don't know).<br />
<br />
<strong>Computer Specs</strong><br />
- HP Computer model CQ5225NL<br />
- Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1<br />
- Processor - Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 QUAD CPU Q8300&nbsp;<br />
- 64-bit Operating System<br />
- Windows is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">genuine</span> (activated with a legal product key).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Monitor Specs</strong><br />
- Philips 221T (22inch WIDE LCD Monitor 221T1<br />
- ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 Series<br />
<br />
<strong>Other<br />
</strong>- Resolution that I use is 1920x1080 (recommend, and never used any other before).
<br />
- Screen zoom-in/out on 100% (default).<br />
<br />
<strong>Things I've tried<br />
</strong>- Restarting computer several times.<br />
- Searched for Drivers that should be updated (20 results). Also something about my monitor, installed the driver, updated it via&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Device Manager</span> but got the following line "Windows has determined the driver software
 for your device is up to date". So I scanned again on missing or not updated drivers, still
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Driver Easy</span> (program that find and install missing drivers) told me that there is a missing update/driver for my monitor.)
<br />
- Made a Update Schedule that should update each day at 2:00 pm (obvious didn't).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>I'm definitely&nbsp;not the best at Hardware/Software/System/Driver problems. So I hope someone in this community can help me out.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</strong>Thanks,<br />
<br />
Dylan<br />

            <p>Hi @Redbear2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thanks for answering my question. The update problem is fixed, I'm at the moment waiting for installing 256+ updates. So that's the good news!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also hope after updating that my screen problem will be fixed, can't find any solution for that online. (But I also didn't find that specific topic you gave me, so perhaps I'm not that good at searching haha).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, thanks for your help! One problem fixed. One too go! :-)</p>

            <p>@Dylan, so glad your updating has been solved. Hopefully your monitor issue will be also. I'm sure you know after updating you need to restart your computer. If the updates don't solve your monitor issue you may want to post a question on just that and maybe
 get an answer.</p>

            Hi  Dijitalz
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You don't need a product key to reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10

<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi, I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Skip the Product Key during install and it will activate with the key embedded in BIOS when it installs. 
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Dijitalz, you do not need to worry about a Product Key, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your Windows 10 issue, this could have happened due to compatibility. To resolve your concern, we suggest that you run troubleshooter. We found a suggestion to run the troubleshooter given by&nbsp;<strong>Nachappa C K</strong> on our Community page.

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would suggest you to run the compatibility troubleshooter to install the driver and check. Type 'Compatibility' in the search box in the task bar and select 'Run programs designed for previous versions'. This should check the compatibility
 of the application and install it. If you are still unable to install, download the drivers from the manufacturer's website for a previous version of Windows and install it compatibility mode. Try these steps and let us know the results.</p>

<h2>            Monitor Screen Goes Black for a couple seconds while in Windows but not in DOS</h2>
                    <p>Hello I recently purchased an HP 510 with a Raedon R5 Graphics card. Since the initial updates to the system my monitor will go black for about 2-3 seconds and then come back on. The power light stays green and there seems to be no rhyme or reason behind
 it. When in DOS however the monitor stays normal. I tried connecting an older monitor, which I could see flickering lights behind the screen and it still would go black off and on. I have contacted HP and did all their troubleshooting steps including resetting
 the PC back to Factory. The problems still exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run the sfc /scannow in CMD Prompt and no errors were found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to resolve the problem with all updates installed and did install the Raedon Settings control as well as installing a new driver. The monitor I am using has not had this type of problem in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WiFi adapter spontaneously going offline in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP P6 desktop running Windows 10. &nbsp;I have spent quite a bit of time with Microsoft support to get OneDrive to work properly on this machine. &nbsp;We were eventually was able to make OneDrive work. &nbsp;However, since that time, the WiFi adapter
 has been unreliable and from time to time has become "disabled" for no apparent reason. &nbsp;The only way to re-enable the adapter is to to a Power Off reboot of the machine (re-enabling the device in the Control Panel does nothing when this occurs). &nbsp;By the way,
 I have updated the device driver to the latest setting. &nbsp;This morning, the WiFi adapter went offline again. &nbsp;This time, I looked at the Event Viewer and found an error at the time when the WiFi adapter crashed. &nbsp;It seems there's an issue with the NetworkUXBroker.exe
 app. &nbsp;I did a little research and have seen some references to an issue with the registry. &nbsp;As noted, I was working for some time with Microsoft support on getting OneDrive to work on this machine and they suggested a few registry edits. &nbsp;I wonder if one is
 causing this issue or if there is another solution to this problem. &nbsp;Below is the text from the Event Viewer. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>as far as I know via prepaid codes you can have up to 36 months in the future.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not all codes stack, only regular subscriptions do, special offers not always stack and in such case it's required to wait until the special offer one ends before adding a new subscription</p>

<p><strong>Remove ALL power and reseat all the cards, memory, and cables (both ends when<br />
possible)</strong> - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Those are for a PC and about all<br />
that can be done for a laptop is reseat the memory and clear the vents. Make sure the BIOS,<br />
low level chipset drivers, and major device drivers are all up to date by check manually at the<br />
makers' sites.</p>
<p>Many Bluescreens are caused by&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers<br />
which are not the most current even though the computer is new. Check manually for updates<br />
using the methods for updates as&nbsp;indicated in the troubleshooter linked above.<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT
<p>An unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT
<p>A breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<p>A memory access violation occurred. (Parameter 4 of the bug check is the address that the driver attempted to access.)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>ntstatus.h </em>file located in the<em>inc</em> directory of the Windows Driver Kit.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><em>If you are not equipped to debug this problem</em>, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters.
 Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you may find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should pinpoint the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, this indicates that a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure a kernel debugger
 is connected and the system is started with the<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame will supply additional information.</p>
<p>If the specific cause of the exception is unknown, the following should be considered:</p>
<p><em>Hardware incompatibility. </em>First, make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p><em>Faulty device driver or system service. </em>In addition, a faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS
 file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, the service can be removed by starting the system using the Recovery Console and deleting the offending
 system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve the error. You should also run hardware
 diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is a system BIOS incompatibility. BIOS problems can be resolved by upgrading the system BIOS version.</p>

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            Are you sure you have both the latest and the correct drivers (64bit? 32bit?) installed?
<br />
Does it show up in the device manager correctly? <br />
Have you contacted the manufacturer, asking whether they provide beta drivers with Win7 support?
<br />
Did the device work correctly in Vista/XP? <br />
Does the device need any drivers at all?<br />
If so, have you tried installing them in Vista compatibility mode?
