<h2>            cannot install windows 8.1 32 bit because processor does not support NX</h2>
                    It means that I have to buy a new processor and motherboard which I am NOT going to do because I am quite satisfied with Windows 7. To install and run windows 7, I did not have to change any hardware!!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to turn on NX in the BIOS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>
<p>You can check if your processor supports NX and turn it on if it is turned off by going into your PC's BIOS. How you get to the BIOS varies, depending on your PC manufacturer. On most PCs, you need to press a key (like F2, F12, Delete, or Esc) or a key combination
 immediately after you turn on your PC, but before <span>Windows</span> starts. For details, check the info that came with your PC or your PC manufacturer's website.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you're in the BIOS, look for the NX or XD settings on the <span>Security</span> tab to turn on NX support. If the BIOS setting for NX support isn't available on your PC, you might need to contact the PC manufacturer for info on updating the BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can causeserious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
 resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;

            I have already done everything that you have suggested and the only solution is to BUY new hardware which I am NOT going to do.<br />
&nbsp;I am already using Windows 7 which does not need any special Hardware. Software can be used to do what NX does, so why is Microsoft so anxious to make people spend money?<br />

            Win 8.1 and Win 10 will install if NX is bypassed but later it will give errors and installation will fail, so it is not the correct solution. It would be much better if MS were to find software solution to this problem and stop trying to make people spend
 extra money on Hardware. After all everyone is not as rich as the people who run Microsoft. :)

                    How do I download pictures from my android phone to my new Windows 8 computer?&nbsp; In my old Vista, all I had to do was plug my phone in to the USB port and it brought up the pictures.&nbsp; When I plugged in my phone, the computer makes the pretty chime but doesn't
 show the phone when you click on "computer devices".&nbsp; Then when I found it and right click on it,&nbsp;I don't have the option of opening it. Very frustrating.

            <p>Thank you so much! It actually was pretty easy. People dribbling on about hating whatever is NOT helpful and should be eradicated by the moderator of the site! Common, peeps! We hear enough neg drib everywhere and it cascades (see example above). I paid
 over a grand for an awesome HP with Vista and used it for Tech Cert class and cleaned it up for my son's graduation gift and he is a writer and gamer and he loves it and we had win7 and new heat paste put in for free and he is still using it after 7 yrs. I
 also have older refurbs that run circles around "hater peeps" with bells and whistles they just do NOT appreciate. I take most of that off the new computers anywho. Have a very productive day and catch me on my family site Pupsrun.com when it finally gets
 out of beta mode. :)</p>

    <title>3rd-party font disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dorcask  say:</h3>
<h2>            3rd-party font disappearing</h2>
                    Two weeks ago I installed a 3rd party OTF font - Stone Sans and Stone Serif - in my Win10 laptop. It worked fine with Word and other programs. Today, it's no longer visible and doesn't show up in the Control Panel -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Fonts window either.
 When I try to reinstall the font, I get a Windows message that it's already installed. I re-installed anyway but the fonts still don't show up in programs or in the Fonts window. What do I need to do to have Win10 "recognize" these fonts again? I can't uninstall
 them because they don't show up in the Fonts window (even though I'm told that they are already installed). Help please!&nbsp;

            <p>More info about my font issue. When I use the cmd prompt and check out the font registry, I find the "missing" fonts at the end of the registry list. Here's a copy of the registry entries:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to get these fonts working again? I'm in the middle of a book design project and the whole book is done in Stone Sans and Stone Serif. These fonts were purchased at myfont.com so are legit fonts. Please help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the fonts then restart the computer and re-install the fonts and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>

<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section ‚Äú<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting‚Äù</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

 I tried installing C++ 2013(x64 and x86) coz my laptop is 64 bit and when I install both of them, they got stuck on "initializing..." and does not progress. The application hangs after I cancel the installation and I terminate it with Task Manager. I have

            I got a problem with it coz I disabled services.msc and it got stuck at being disabled and can't manually enable it. I fixed it by just restarting/rebooting my PC and thus enabling services.msc and now I can install C++ 2013 Res.<br />

            What do you mean by "I disabled services.msc"? What do you disabled in services.msc? Rebooting PC didn't help me.

            I'm not 100% sure but I think you can only play sounds from&nbsp;1 output at a time. I could be wrong, if you go into the sound section of control panel from the start menu&nbsp;and make sure both audio devices are enabled, they will either both play, or only the
 one set as the default device will play.

<h2>            PIN and Fingerprint Sign-in options unavailable &#40;greyed out&#41; in Windows 10 1607 Enterprise</h2>
                    <p>I have tested this on a Lenovo Yoga 260 laptop and a Lenovo M93P desktop (with attached external fingerprint reader). After installing Windows 10 Enterprise (whether via an in place upgrade or fresh install), the PIN and Fingerprint Sign-in options are unavailable
 as the buttons are disabled/greyed out. TPM is enabled and functioning properly and is working with Bitlocker. These options were there on 1511. The option for Picture password is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group policies for the new Windows Hello for Business, and also the legacy convenience PIN etc. are not present/not configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one know what the requirements are to get this working again, or is this a bug?</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the possible reasons you're getting error code 656 is due to a corrupted software or window registry damage.

<h2>            Windows 10 turns off my file sharing</h2>
                    <p>I have an old XP machine and a PC running Windows 10.&nbsp; Until very recently, they were networked and shared a printer which is attached by USB to the Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, however, when I change the settings in Network and Sharing Center to Turn on file and printer sharing it turns itself off again and when I try to change the Firewall settings to allow file and printer sharing and Homegroup sharing, they turn back off
 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me nuts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run all the troubleshooters until I'm blue in the face, all the updates are installed and I just don't know what to do next.</p>

<p>Hello Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the game is not showing, you could try uninstalling and reinstalling your profile. This will update the information for games and such that you own. Also how did you purchase the game? If through the store then you can check for the purchase on the
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account website</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hey Kevin thanks for keeping in touch!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As suggested by fellow XBF Brad A sign out of the profile on the Xbox App, go to settings and under the Microsoft Account email there is a Sign out button. Give it a shot
<strong>If and only if the email and password are known</strong>. Once its signed out sign back in using the information of the Microsoft Account and try to re-download Forza and let us know how it goes!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've got a download (automatic) which won't install for ‚Ä¢ Feature update to Windows 10, version 1803.</p>

</p><p>I'd like to upgrade to 1803 but none of the downloads will install: KB4284848 or KB4338819.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get rid of the Feature update and the KBs both say that they're not for my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I go from here? Where is a KB that will update 1709 to 1803?</p>

            Hi  monkeeeeeeeeeem 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi,
<br />Updating to Windows 10 1803 manually should solve all your problems.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

 </blockquote> <p>yea its weird cause I'm pretty sure I know what the issue is, I just don't know how to fix it. We are on different client versions, me being on v1.2.0.25 her being on v1.2.0.20. which makes no since why her client would be outdated... Especially cause she got that client from joining and downloading the beta.</p><p><br /></p>

                    <p>Does Window 8.1 support IEEE1394 Fire Wire for High Definition streaming.&nbsp; Works OK in Std. Definition, but halts and fails in High Definition high transfer rate.&nbsp; (Movie Maker)</p>
<p>I have been told it needs Legacy drivers from Windows 7, and the driver with Windows 8 generates an error with high transfer rates.&nbsp; There is a hotfix for Win 7, but cannot find one for Win 8.</p>
<p>Any work-arounds?</p>

            <p>Hi, Thank you for the response.&nbsp; There are quite a few Microsoft search articles for IEEE1394 driver in Windows 7 not responding when uploading large size HDV video.&nbsp; There are several Hotfix's for Windows 7 that address the replacement of the Default 1394
 driver in Windows 7.&nbsp; I am experiencing the same problem in Windows 8.&nbsp; I can upload Standard Definition 720 but not 1080 High Definition video from my professional Sony HVR-HD1000U mini tape HD camera.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Refer to Hotfix KB-2589986 and Hotfix KB-226116.&nbsp; These describe the issue with Windows 8 HD video uploads.&nbsp; The same issue occurs in Microsoft Movie Maker and in Video Studio Pro X6.&nbsp; Articles from several help sources, including Sony, indicate there are
 no special camera drivers, that the mini tape camera uses Windows drivers.&nbsp; It sounds like either applying the Windows 7 Hotfix to Window 8 should work.&nbsp; Or, is it possible to find the older 1394OHCI drivers that were with Windows Vista?&nbsp; The camera works
 great uploading HD video in Window Vista, but not Window 8.&nbsp; I tried copying the Vista drivers into Windows 8, however, when I try to select the older driver, it is not "signed" so it wont let me load it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get a signed older (from Windows 7) Legacy firewire driver (it should show "Legacy" in the description) to work in Windows 8&nbsp; That is where I have been stuck for two months, frustrated that Windows did not include the drivers to support HD video
 uploads using the IEEE1394 Firewire card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me find the 1394OHCI "Legacy" driver.....&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks.</p>

            <p>Based on Microsoft Support FAQs, I believe the "signed" "Legacy" driver must also be 64 bit compatible, as my Win 8.1 is 64 bit.&nbsp; I tried to change the OHCI Compliant IEEE 1394 Host Controller Win Vista driver in compatibility mode, but it says "the driver
 is not digitally signed", and then when I try to install it, it says the INF (Microsoft = "$CHICAGO$" 2006) does not contain digital signature information.&nbsp; My Vista system is 64 bit, but I cannot get over the digital signature issue?&nbsp; How do I download the
 64bit Win 7 Firewire "Legacy" driver?</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to start the computer in safe mode and run chkdsk successfully. To do this, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you
 can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear in blue at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.<br />
For your reference, I‚Äôm adding a link that talks about ‚ÄúA description of the Safe Mode Boot options‚Äù:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</a></span></p>
<p><span>Once the computer has booted successfully in safe mode, try the following steps to run chkdsk successfully.<br />
i. Click Start, type cmd, right click on cmd and then click ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
ii. <span>&nbsp;</span>At the command prompt, type the following command and then hit enter.<br />
chkdsk /p<br />
iii. Once the above command is run, then run the following command and then hit enter.<br />
chkdsk /r</span></p>
<p><span>To graphically perform the actions, follow these steps.<br />
i.<span>&nbsp; </span>Click Start, click Computer.<br />
ii. <span>&nbsp;</span>Right click on the drive where you want to run chkdsk and then click Properties.<br />
iii.<span>&nbsp; </span>Click the Tools tab.<br />
iv. <span>&nbsp;</span>Click Check Now‚Ä¶ button under Error-checking.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
v. Check the disk options and then click Start button.<br />
vi. <span>&nbsp;</span>Restart the computer once the chkdsk has completed successfully.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span>
 Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Most Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One are around 7 - 8gb. The dlc is stored on the consoles hard drive,&nbsp; so you should have enough space to install it.&nbsp; You can also buy an external drive and install that on your Xbox One, and store your games on that, or
 uninstall some games to make space on your console hard drive.

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.

<br />
<br />If the issue persists, then try to uninstall and re-install the audio driver.
<br />
<br />    Press Windows  Logo Key+X. Click on Device Manager.
<br />    In the list of hardware categories, look for the device that you want to update, and then right-click on it to Uninstall.

<br />    To re-install, either you can restart the system or install the driver from the manufacturer√≠s website (recommended as they will have updated drivers).
