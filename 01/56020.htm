<h2>            Inheritors</h2>
                    
<p>
I am wondering . . . How many Inheritors are there in Halo: Reach right now? I am still not seeing too many in matchmaking, but most Inheritors won't play without a big team to back them up and plus most aren't really all that good. Last I saw on HaloCharts,
 there were about 1,500 Inheritors. How many Inheritors do you guys think there are now? I myself am almost there (Reclaimer right now).</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure there are a bunch of Inheritors by now. The game has been out for awhile now. And yea its true that they all play with a group of others and that's not really a problem. Inheritor is just a rank it doesn't mean since they are the highest
 rank in Reach that they are amazing at this game. It just shows how long they played it. It doesn't matter.</p>

<p>just becuase you have played thousands of games doesnt make you the best player out there. halo reach ranks are based on the amount of time you play not your skill level. I have seen people that are higher ranked than I am but are terrible and i have played
 against lower ranks that are some of the best players i have ever seen. ranks dont mean much outside of finding out if halo is their favorite game or not.</p>

<p>There was a site that kept track of more stats then Bungie did but can't seem to recall the name. I remember being able to see a breakdown of ranks and how many people are at that rank.

<p>^^What direction is that, exactly? We really don't know much about Halo 4 still. The only thing being excessively complained about on the 343 forums is the retention of sprint, which I think is a silly thing to get worked up over.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Don't turn into Speedy now, Haraki. Being outrageously negative with no premise is his "thing" :P</p>

    <title>A bug to disable W10&#39;s night light feature&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ant dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            A bug to disable W10&#39;s night light feature&#63;</h2>
                    Since I was using this PC very late at night earlier, I noticed W10 v1803's screen had a<br />
yellowish tint color. I thought my VGA cable was an issue, but I didn't see this problem at<br />
BIOS, boot up, etc. I literally saw white turns to yellowish at W10's login screen every time I<br />
boot up W10. I can't seem to fix it with https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-yellow-tint-fix/<br />
suggestions. Disabling night light did not save and change my screen. I did manage to make it<br />
work if I disable the automatic date and time, and put 1 PM instead of 1 AM. I was able to save<br />
the change to disable this night light feature. I re-eneabled the automatic date and time, and<br />
it kept my disabled setting.<br />
<br />
Strange! A bug? Or something broken in this W10 installation?<br />

            Hi Ant.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's normally orange-ish, so I'm wondering about your display driver.  But if the toggle in Display Settings won't actually turn it off then we need to check over your system or account for corruption.
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it may remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

<h2>            Farmville 2 country escape &#40;app for windows 10&#41; is not working properly&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi my name is Delisha,</span></p>
<p><span>I have a Hp 15 notebook (I don't know if that well help you or not but I hope it does)
</span></p>
<p><span>Okay so Farmville 2 country escape (app for windows 10) is not working properly at first I had problems loading the game (I thought it was Windows 8 due to the fact that I needed to update to 10 ..but it
 wasn't) but now that seems to work I guess someone fix that problem but now the game is freezing and kicking me off to the point that it also logs me off of Facebook. (correction it has been doing that since I first installed the game) and I noticed that if
 I'm not logged in the game kicks me off even faster. I'm sometimes able to play for a good 15 to 20 minutes more or less before the game kicks me off. If I push on the bulletin board or try to sell/buy something the game will freeze and I'm kicked off once
 again. I'm seriously running out of options here!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have cleaned off my computer everything is up to date (I mean really&nbsp;my Hp 15 is&nbsp;fresh out of the box) I have gone to different forms for help on this issue as well such as changing the sittings/restarting my computer if the game
 crashes...which it does!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; I even went as far as removing it from my computer then reinstalling it which seems to have been a huge mistake now due to the fact that I can't get pass the trial to login so I can automatically be back
 to my original level I'm stuck in the trial mod at the beginning of the game it took me literally a month to get off of that the first time!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I don't want to go through that again... Please Help Me!!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p />

            My brand new Dell laptop is having the same issue&nbsp; it force closes before I can even log in past the introduction of the game&nbsp; My other Dell laptop runs it just fine, so I have to suspect it is a recent change that is causing it.&nbsp; Has your problem resolved
 yet? If so, did you find a fix or did it fix itself after so much time?

    <title>Can&#39;t upload files since update a week ago. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveswizard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t upload files since update a week ago.</h2>
                    <p>I have not been able to upload files or even larger pictures since the last update. According to the chrome developer tools the connection is timing out before the complete file can upload. According to my net speed monitor, the files will try to upload
 in spurts and stops, almost like some kind of compression software is controlling it, very badly. Since I only have access to a very slow internet connection, 1.3mb, this can be very frustrating trying over and over again to upload anything. I have not added
 or deleted anything. The only change has been the MS update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have version 1803 windows 10 and have been reading the horror stories about what this update has done to the file system, but nothing specifically about this problem. Tried uninstalling the update and system restore but no luck. Any advice or ways
 to correct this problem will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Dave.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Were you able to roll back to Version 1709 or not?  If it doesn't work from Recovery Settings you can try from Repair Mode here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates using the same tool above.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>You most likely need a<em> Codec package</em> for your video player.<em> Codec</em>'s are like translaters that take the video image format and encode and/or decode it for viewing in your favourite media player. I would recommend that you download and install
 the<strong> K-Lite Codec pack</strong> from here,</p>
<p><strong>Download K-Lite Codec Pack</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm</a></p>
<p>Get either the<strong> Standard</strong> or<strong> Full</strong> package halfway down the page. There is a package specifically tailored for 64 bit systems if your Windows 7 is that flavour. The 64 bit package is not always necessary as most&nbsp;programs&nbsp;are
 still 32 bit.</p>
<p>Another option is to download and install a good, free media player that has all relevant codecs preinstalled. If you are not 100% happy with your current video player program, consider,</p>
<p><strong>VLC media player for Windows</strong><br />

go to above link to read about this<br />
<br />
several options<br />
<br />
uninstall .net 4&nbsp; it is a standalone program so uninstalling will not interfere with all the other .nets<br />
<br />
you can reinstall it later if you desire<br />
<br />
Norton is not a very good antivirus, I would uninstall it and try another free program such as Microsoft security essentials.<br />
<br />
However, you should scan your pc for malware and spyware:<br />
<br />
<p><b><u><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Download, install, update and do full scan with these free malware detection programs:</u></b></p>

<p>=============================================================<br />
Changing your region is a bad idea because you only <br />
get 5 changes and you're done.</p>
<p>Try the freeware VLC Media Player to play your DVD:</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)</p>

    <title>Achievement Issue in Black Flag. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tvthepunisher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Achievement Issue in Black Flag.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there, so I've been able to unlock all but one of the multiplayer achievements. &nbsp;Most recently the Level 55 achievement, which didn't pop until after I prestiged and leveled once or twice. &nbsp;It "stealth popped" &nbsp;but..that's not the one I'm having the
 issue with.<br />
<br />
The achievement I have a problem with is "Personal Bag of Tricks", which is a relatively simple achievement - customize an ability set and complete one session using it. &nbsp;Well I've completed close to a hundred, between sessions with friends, random online games
 and so forth...and I've always had customized sets. &nbsp;I've tried all the methods listed in TrueAchievements and XBA guides for "customizing" the loadout but nothing worked. &nbsp;It's odd that this achievement, which should be one of your first, is still having
 issues unlocking.<br />
<br />
Apparently, as I checked through one of the TA solutions, it glitches for quite a few folks...is there some sort of fix that can be applied on the Xbox Support end? =/ I'm working on completing all these Assassin's Creeds and I finished Black Flag on the 360
 a couple years back, now it's the One's turn...except it's been nothing but a pain.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This isn't the first achievement to glitch like this...nah, that was Master of the Caribbean (complete Discovery in Wolfpack). &nbsp;It wouldn't pop for almost a week of trying then finally did randomly...</p>
<p>I've had this issue with Bag of Tricks for roughly 30 days spanned across several months since trying to play through the game. &nbsp;I am not an active Black Flag player so to speak but this one achievement, this Personal Bag of Tricks, should long ago have
 popped...</p>

<p>Is there any fix for this? &nbsp;I have tried so many things since I last posted this and still no success. &nbsp;One guy who had my issue said it finally unlocked for him later on but he doesn't know what he did different. &nbsp;As one of the easiest achievements in this
 game it's proving the hardest to unlock =/</p>

            There is no unknown devices in device manager. &nbsp;Since it was working fine for a week or two I doubt that updating windows will fix it. &nbsp;There is nothing in the event log aside from the error that I mentioned in the title. &nbsp;My chipset drivers are up to

<h2>            Computer not booting</h2>
                    <p>Computer won't boot up and says "automatic startup repair couldn't repair your pc". I tried many things like going to command prompt and doing the bootrec /rebuild bcd, bootrec /fixmbr and bootrec /fixboot. All were successful until fixboot, which said "access
 is denied." I then used /chkdsk which found nothing wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I tried using the windows 10 installation media and going to repair your PC. Got the same results. I currently cannot go back to my HDD and get out of the installation media. Any help would be appreciated. My most recent hardware change was upgrading
 my graphics card on January 3rd. I uninstalled and reinstalled all the drivers and did it properly so that should most likely not be the problem. Last night was the first time I started noticing and issue after my PC did not shutdown on its own. Again, any
 help would be great.</p>
<p>Could I also just install Windows from the media and somehow keep my files?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>“<strong>Automatic Repair couldn’t repair your PC</strong>” error on Windows 10 Automatic Repair is a built-in troubleshooter which should help you fix some of the most common issues regarding your PC. However, due to some system failures or corrupted components,
 the troubleshooter sometimes fails to be successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some troubleshooting steps that you may perform to get this issue fixed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Troubleshooting with Command Prompt</strong><br />
Since Automatic Repair is a tool which usually deals with startup issues, here are some useful commands which might help you get rid of this error message and possibly even eliminate the option of fixing your PC at all</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your Windows login screen and click on the <strong>Power </strong>
button. </li><li>Hold the <strong>Shift </strong>key while clicking on <strong>Restart </strong>
in order to enter <strong>Boot Options</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> and click on
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>When <strong>Command Prompt</strong> opens, copy and paste the following lines and make sure you click
<strong>Enter </strong>after each command if you want to run it:<br />
<strong><em>bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd</em></strong><br />
<em><strong>bootrec.exe /fixmbr</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>bootrec.exe /fixboot</strong></em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, the commands above were able to fix the boot of the system and got rid of the “Automatic Repair couldn’t repair your PC” message once and for all. While you are still in the Command Prompt, run the commands below in order to check your disk
 for errors:</p>
<p><em><strong>chkdsk /r c:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>chkdsk /r d:</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that you will have to know just what are the letters corresponding to your hard drive partitions and the letters
<strong>C: </strong>and <strong>D:</strong> are the usual ones for each computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Troubleshooting in Safe Mode</strong></p>
<p>There are still a couple of quite useful commands in Command Prompt which you should try but it’s the best if you use these commands while is Safe Mode because the error message we are dealing with is sometimes caused by a faulty driver or a system file
 which might not show up if we did the scan in normal boot.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reboot your computer and wait for the boot screen to appear. It’s usually the screen with your PC’s manufacturer with the options such as “Press _ to Run Setup”, etc.</li><li>As soon as that screen appears, start pressing the <strong>F8 </strong>key on your keyboard. If the
<strong>F8 </strong>key doesn’t work, reboot your computer again and start pressing the
<strong>F5 </strong>key.</li><li>The <strong>Windows Advanced Options Menu</strong> should open, enabling you to choose several options to boot your computer.</li><li>Boot into <strong>Safe Mode</strong> with <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>As soon as <strong>Command Prompt</strong> opens, try copying and pasting the commands below in order to check your Windows image for errors (DISM) and to check your system for any missing or broken files (SFC).<br />
<strong><em>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealthsfc /scannow</em></strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please allow these commands enough time to finish and don’t restart or shut down your computer before they finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Disabling early launch Anti-Malware protection</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your Windows login screen and click on the <strong>Power </strong>
button. </li><li>Hold the <strong>Shift </strong>key while clicking on <strong>Restart </strong>
in order to enter <strong>Boot Options</strong>.</li><li>When the <strong>Boot Menu</strong> opens, navigate to <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>
&gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong>. <br />
</li><li>Your PC should restart and boot to a list of options for you to choose. Choose the number next to the
<strong>Disable </strong>early launch anti-malware protection option and restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Delete the file which is causing these issues</strong></p>
<p>There's a huge possibility that one of the files on your computer simply malfunctioned due to corruption and now causing problems or conflicts with your device which the Automatic Repair can’t deal with. If the file at hand is not a system file, you can
 locate it and delete it easily.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your Windows login screen and click on the Power button. </li><li>Hold the shift key while clicking on Restart in order to enter Boot Options.</li><li>When the Boot Menu opens, navigate to Troubleshoot &gt;&gt; Advanced Options &gt;&gt; Command Prompt.<br />
<strong><em>cd </em></strong><strong><em>C:</em></strong><strong><em>WindowsSystem32LogFilesSrt</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>SrtTrail.txt</em></strong></li><li>The file should open immediately and try to look for a message looking like this:<br />
“<strong>Boot critical file _________ is corrupt.</strong>”</li><li>Any file can be displayed in the message and that it most definitely the file that is causing this issue and you will have to delete it if it’s not a system file. In order to delete the file, you need to navigate to its location using Command Prompt. For
 example, if the file is locating in the “drivers” folder in System32 (these files are usually the cause for the issue), you can locate it via this command:<em><strong><br />
cd c:\windows\system32\drivers</strong></em></li><li>Delete the file by using the “<strong>del</strong>” command and the name of the file next to it, divided by a single space.del errorfile.sys</li><li>Restart your computer, uninstall the program to which the file belonged to and check to see if your issue is resolved.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We are eager on getting this resolved for you, we will wait for your feedback.</p>

            First, what makes you say or think there is no operating system? Just because you get a file missing/corrupt error does not mean you have no operating system. If you have no operating system there is no need to re-install the missing/corrupt file. The
 operating system is made up of more than just one file. <br />
<br />
<br />
Having said that, and assuming you are incorrect about not having an operating system, chances are very good the hal.dll file is not actually missing/corrupt. Most likely it is your boot.ini file.
<br />
<br />
Many times this error can be corrected by running check disk from Recovery Console. Be advised you may need to run check disk several times to get positive results and that the scan can sometimes take hours depending on the size of your hard drive and other
 factors. <br />
<br />
Follow the instructions below carefully. <br />
<br />
<p>1. Insert the Windows XP CD into your CD drive and restart your computer. If you are prompted, select any options required to start (boot) from the CD. If you do not have a Windows Xp disc, follow the instructions
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic270018.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a> to create a Windows Xp Recovery Console.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
2. When the text-based part of Setup begins, follow the prompts. Select the repair or recover option by pressing R.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
3. If you have a dual-boot or multiboot system, select the installation that you want to access from the Recovery Console.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
4. When you are prompted, type the Administrator password. If you have not set a password for the admin account simply press enter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
5. At the command prompt, type chkdsk /r &gt; press enter. (Note there is a space between the letter k and the forward slash).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
6. At the conclusion of the scan type exit &gt; press enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
7. Restart your computer.</p>

            Your original post states you cannot load Windows. Are you now telling me that you can? Even if you can it is best to run check disk from Recovery Console as my instructions above state.

            can I &nbsp;run disk check in the " run " by typing chkdsk, is this the same . I'm not a computer expert , I have limited&nbsp;knowledge and don't feel comfortable doing the recovery disk . is it the same as chkdsk in "run"&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Question # 2 I recently changed the System configuration utility,,A&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;tech asked me to do this to do a clean boot When I try to change system configuration utility back to normal start up . after rebooting , it automatically goes back to selective
 start up with all the boxes checked . . When I first turn on computer it prompts me to choose from Microsoft&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;XP home edition or Microsoft Windows XP set up&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't under stand why it does this. Why won't my System Configuration utility change after clicking apply and OK ? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;your&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;and time " Tech Geek , you seem very&nbsp;knowledgeable, I'm not that great with computers and am&nbsp;Leary&nbsp;of doing things I'm not comfortable with . After doing what the Microsoft tech. asked me to do I&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;start&nbsp;windows&nbsp;without&nbsp;inserting&nbsp;my
 XP disk , thank god for that , or I would have taken the tower to the computer store where it was built.&nbsp;</div>

I clicked on the suggested link and the page it sent me to had nothing to do with syncing at all. I clicked on every link on the page and nothing about syncing. However, I disconnected, then re connected and it synced and I downloaded it.

<p>I do not believe you can play media off of any device that is not a USB storage device. If you are to use a USB drive to play music through your console, all you gotta do is to plug it into the console, when you look into your storage device you'll just
 need to format it, and then you can slap some music files onto the USB drive and play it on your console.</p>
<p>For instructions you can check out this page for using a USB flash drive.</p>

<p>G'day Poet! Let's see if we can get that phone working with your console.<br />
<br />
What file format is your music saved as? (MP3, AAC, etc) Is it saved in an area on your phone that's accessible to the Xbox 360 console?<br />
<br />
Let's make sure you have the <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Optional-Media-Update/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802fffe07df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Optional Media Update</a> downloaded to include more filetypes.<br />
<br />
Also <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/audio-video-setup-and-use/play-media-from-portable-media-player#fbe492e909774fc4bdab057605ffd98a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
check out the steps here</a> to play media from a portable device.<br />
<br />
If you're still not able to get it playing, let us know and we'll see what other solutions may help. It may be that it simply won't be compatible, but let's exhaust any other ideas before we humor that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Poet,</p>
<p>&nbsp;As Misses Joust has asked, what is the file format of your music? I've never used my Android S4 Active as a portable music player but for the sake of assisting I've attempted to do so. Browsing the phone contents I show my music stored in the location \\SAMSUNG-SGH-I537\Phone\Music\
 . I am also using .mp3 formats. One following the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/audio-video-setup-and-use/play-media-from-portable-media-player#fbe492e909774fc4bdab057605ffd98a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">steps</a><span>&nbsp;to play media from a portable device my device
 showed all folders on the phone. I was able to browse to the music folder and could see the files. One problem that i noticed when attempting to browse the folders when hooked up to my PC is that it wouldn't read anything until I unlocked the screen, then
 the file explorer showed the folders. I doubt this is the problem, but it's worth a shot to make sure that once connected via USB that your phone is unlocked. Currently, I'm leaning toward the file format being the potential issue here. Just let us know and
 we'll be more than glad to continue assisting. Thank you,</span></p>

<p>First off, most Android phones have internal (built in) and external (micro SD card) storage. Unfortunatly the 360 will only recognize&nbsp;the internal storage so any media files you want to access will have to be stored there.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of things that you will have to do in order for your phone to be recognized by the 360. *These steps will be done on your phone, not the 360.*<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Turn off USB debugging.</p>
<ol>
<li>While on the home screen press the menu button and select settings. </li><li>Scroll down towards the bottom of the screen and select Developer options. </li><li>Deselect USB debugging if it's enabled. </li></ol>
<p>Connect as a Mass Storage device.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug your phone into the 360. </li><li>While on the home screen open the notification drawer. (swipe down from the top of the screen where the time and data connection are displayed)
</li><li>Select the notification titled "Connected as a (connection type)." </li><li>Select Mass Storage. </li></ol>
<p><br />
I just did all of this on my Droid 4 and it works. I hope it does the same for you.</p>

<p>I'm using a galaxy centura and I turned USB debugging off but when I go to select what its connected as, it only says Media device(MTP) or Camera. No option for mass storage. Help! (If you have an answer for this please send a private message. Thanks.)</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Build 7601 - This copy of Windows is not genuine</h2>
                    <div>I have just been notified (22/03/2012) that my Copy of Windows is not genuine, when booting up my laptop I also gets the Serial number not found BS ... Before getting to this point, I tried reinstalling windows (which is preinstalled on the laptop) NO
 BUDGE and also by disk that I created not long after purchasing ... still nada ... I've had this laptop for nearly 2 years so i know for a fact i did have a genuine copy (as this is the first time this problem has come up) and as for the serial key, due to
 wear and tear i can no longer see it as its faded out ... feeling kinda ripped off here &gt;(</div>

<h2>            .NET Framework Error when I turn my computer on&#63;</h2>
                    Hi Everyone!<br />
<br />
For a little while now, whenever I turn my computer on, I get multiple windows (usually 10 or so) telling me of an error with .NET Framework. The error is as follows:<br />
<br />
<p>Microsoft .NET Framework</p>
<p>Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.<br />
<br />
The remote server returned an error: (500) Internal Server Error<br />
<br />
I can post the details if needed, but in case they're not, I don't want to clog up the post!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help given!<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
David :)</p>

            <p><span>Hi David,<br />
<br />
1. What is the exact and complete error message you get?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to refer the link and try to repair the .Net framework:</span></p>
<b><span>Error codes “0x80070643” or “0x643” occur when you install the .NET Framework updates</span></b><span><br />

<h2>            netstat -bn need elevation windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hello folks,
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Windows 8.1 and when I use the cmd feature netstat, and more specifically type in netstat -bn, I get this action requires elevation. &nbsp;I read that it asks for this confirmation to limit external forces from doing harm to the machine, which is
 fine. &nbsp; I am the administrator and need to know how to grant privileges to myself to use this feature please. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your efforts.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sincerely,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Matthew</div>

            <p><span>Hi Matthew,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run the commands which needs administrative privileges, you need to open the Command prompt as Administrator. I would suggest you to follow these steps to run the
 Command prompt as Administrator:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to
<b>Start</b> screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<b>command</b>” without quotes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on
<b>Command Prompt</b> and click on <b>Run as administrator</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. If you have any further issues on the computer, please post your question regarding Windows and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            That doesnt work for me. Having same issue. Which would suggest that I am running as admin. But still requires elevation for netstat -b.
