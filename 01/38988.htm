 and most of the others programs where useless and most of my documents and pictures where "Deleted" i have found out i need to use sfc /scannow but first there came up a problem i need to restart my computer and i tried that. Then i found out the problem but
 now it has the error "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operations" some says that admin&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">privilege could fix the problem but since i am in recovery
 mode and can`t boot up to the windows. Could anybody help with sfc or the whole "corrupt" hard drive / deleted files.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            How to get out of a Built-In Administrator account and set it up as your own.</h2>
                    Some times a window comes up when I go to open something that says that I do not have Administrator rights. I do not know if there is a password. Every thing ask for a password and as it is not good to keep using the same one I change them. Unfortunately
 at age 69 it is not easy to remember all of this stuff. How do I change it so I can access any thing on my computer and make changes as I see fit like I was able to do by not having this window come up on previous versions of Windows?

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>It looks that you would like to change the password for admin account as you are being prompted to put a password to login.<br />
<br />
Please write to us with the answer of the following question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1) Are you the administrator of your computer?<br />
2) Do you have any other account appart from to which you have logged in?</div>
<div>3) Which account&nbsp;are you&nbsp;using to login ( Microsoft account or Local account)?</div>
<div>4) When exactly&nbsp;are you&nbsp;getting the message that says " you do not have the administrative rights'?</div>
<div>5) What exactly are you trying to access on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Administrator accounts provide the most control over a PC. To help protect your PC (and keep other people from making changes you don't want), administrator accounts should be used sparingly. You'll need to use an administrator account if you're setting
 up accounts for other people on your PC. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If&nbsp;you are&nbsp;administrator of the computer and you are&nbsp;using standard account,&nbsp; you can always change the account type from standard to administrator, but you&nbsp;have to know the password for the administartor account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have logged in to your computer with&nbsp;a standard user then you need to have the privilege to make changes otherwise you will be prompted for the password.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please refer to the link for more information: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Which user account is right for me?</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/which-user-account-for-me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/which-user-account-for-me</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I hope this resolves your issue, please write to us if you have any other issue.

<h2>            Unable to Open Word, Excel or PDF files from email attachments</h2>
                    <p>I am using Chrome as my browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No attachments will open from email!&nbsp; So even when I save these files and even rename the files, no attachments are opening.&nbsp; I keep getting messages that the files are corrupt or that the file name and association don't match (which is not true).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have been able to open Excel files is to do it from google sheets, and then I can open and work in them...but cannot keep them in my preferred format Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This just started about 2 months ago and I am very frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a number of complaints about this but haven't found any solutions yet from Microsoft.</p>

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try setting up your webmail and Office mail accounts in Windows 10 Mail to see if it works better:  <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00...</a>
<br />
<br />Try another browser for this.   I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser.  
<br />
<br />If the problem persists reset Chrome from its Advanced Settings.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have just bought a LifeChat LX300 headset to use for Skype and for work purposes.</p>
<p>Connecting the device to my old Vista machine was easy, the drivers installed first time round and both sound and mic OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plugged it into my new Windows 10 Asus Transformerpad and only the mic on Skype works. No sound at all. Also, playing music or youtube there's no sound through the headset. All OK on the Vista machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've scoured the forum and tried setting everything to default, uninstalling the drivers, reinstalling the drivers etc. to no avail.

            Then I can only suggest you to wait until the next cumulative update.
<br />One thing other, try creating a new user account and see if it exhibits the same behaviour

<h2>            Windows 10 updates prevent my pc from booting correctly - No help from Microsoft&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Having recently updated to Windows 10 I noticed that every time an update is issued my pc will not boot correctly and therefore cannot be used. I installed an SSD to boot from like most people. I contacted Microsoft directly and after a number
 of calls and departments, I eventually spoke with someone who stated they had remedied the problem. Only, come the next update the problem was not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered that if I start the computer in F12 I can then reassign the SSD as primary boot and all is well. Until next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But really, should I have to keep doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked for help from microsoft repeatedly but no answer can be found. I am often given instructions that do not match the OS and when I seek clarification I am repeatedly ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been dealing with this problem for several weeks now and I'm already on four pages of emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS cannot fix the problem then I can only conclude that W10 is really as bad as everyone says.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disappointed.</p>

            The problem with your story is that Windows does not boot your computer. Booting is accomplished by the BIOS or UEF, as the case may be. Once booted, the BIOS or UEF hands control of the computer to the operating system. This is what people mean when they
 speak of 'booting into Windows.'

            <p>Two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Do not conclude that "W10 is really as bad as everyone says" without the facts. In addition, "everyone" doesn't know how to use a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Contact your computer manufacturer's technical support for questions about your BIOS/EFI. An even better idea, in my opinion, is to ask in the manufacturer's own community forum, where you are often more likely to find someone who knows about these things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your issue may need only a small change to the BIOS/EFI or it may be that you made a small mistake when installing your SSD. It doesn't sound like you made a big mistake - that's my area of expertise.</p>

            <p>Specifically, by everyone, I mean everyone I have spoken to regarding W10 as MS's flagship OS. &nbsp;They all say that W7 is far superior or better or less trouble, easier to use, more intuitive. You get the picture. Therefore, W7 good...

    <title>Unable to remove Japanese from Language Bar in Windows 7x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mlbrandow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to remove Japanese from Language Bar in Windows 7x64</h2>
                    
<p>Seems pretty straightforward but it is very frustrating:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go into language bar settings, and there is no Japanese IME there.&nbsp; I had installed it before but have since removed it.&nbsp; Sometimes I go to add the language back then remove it, and this works temporarily.&nbsp; But it always seems to keep coming back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I alt+shift between google pinyin IME and standard US English keyboard.&nbsp; But when I'm in pinyin IME and i hit alt+shift, sometimes it goes to Japanese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this happens (as now) I open up language settings and Japenese DOES NOT SHOW UP as an installed language.&nbsp; Only google pinyin and US english are on there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get rid of this permanently?</p>

<p>Okay so the way I finally solved it (hasn't come back yet anyway) is... once I removed the language, I copied the preferences over for all users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it was only removing it for my own user, and then coming back via restart before it loaded my preferences or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the problem has finally been solved, hooray!</p>

<h2>            Re-enter your network credentials</h2>
                    I just bought a My Cloud from Western Digital. I set it up in my network with out any problems. &nbsp;I proceeded to set it up to automatically backup files from my laptop using options in my file history area. &nbsp;it backed up files no problem. &nbsp;Today I wake
 up the a notification on my computer stating that I have to
<div>'reenter your network credentials'. I'm not quite sure what credentials it is referring to. &nbsp;What are network credentials? &nbsp;When i clock on this option it asks me for a user name and password, but will not accept the ones that i think it is referring to.
 &nbsp;So I guess I'm asking what user name and password I should use to get this automatic back up running again. &nbsp;Oh and I am running window 8.</div>

<p>put a '\' in front of your WDMYCLOUD username and then use the password you setup. For instance if your username on the WD is 'john' then put '\john' for username and then type in your password and see if that doesn't let you in.</p>

    <title>Remote desktop connection issue related to LAN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john anthony cogan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote desktop connection issue related to LAN</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a 2 PC network connected. I mainly use it for ICS and file storage. My host PC is Windows Vista Home and is the one that runs my internet connection. My client PC is Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>The client PC connects to the host PC without issue and internet is shared correctly.</p>
<p>My issue is that I only have one monitor and wanted to use Remote Desktop to connect to the host pc to redial my connection without having to change the monitor cable.</p>
<p>I have run Remote Desktop Connection on the client PC and provide the correct username and password but the login dialog simply disappears when I click connect and nothing else happens.</p>
<p>If I provide the incorrect username or password for the host PC the window gives me the error message that login failed, so this seems to suggest that something odd is going on when its provided the correct username and password because it should open the
 desktop window after that for the host PC.</p>
<p>I have also tried this with the firewall turned off on both PCs, and I have checked that Remote assistance is allowed on both as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tested the Remote Desktop connection from the VISTA PC to the Windows 7 PC and logged on fine but I need to be able to connect from thew Wondows 7 pc to the Vista PC as the Windows 7 one is the one I do all my work on.</p>
<p>Any hints as to where I am going wrong would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Windows 7 Home Premium CANNOT act as a "Host"<br />
<br />
However, you may want to try "Teamviewer"</p>
<p>"The confusion comes from the fact that RDC consists of 2 components.<br />
Remote Desktop Client.&nbsp; This is the software that allows a computer to CONNECT TO another computer.<br />
Remote Desktop Host.&nbsp; This is the software that allows enables the computer to HOST a connection from another computer.</p>
<p>The client is used by the system you are physically located at.<br />
The host is used by the system you are connecting to remotely.</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium (as well as all version of XP, Vista, and Windows 7) has the remote CLIENT.<br />
Any Windows 7 machine can remotely access any machine that has remote desktop host.</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium DOES NOT have the remote desktop host.&nbsp; Other computer can not remotely access a Windows 7 Home Premium machine.</p>
<p>So if you have two computers one with Pro and one with Home.<br />
The Home machine and the Pro machine can access any computer with Remote Desktop Host installed.<br />
The Pro machine can be accessed by any machine with the Remote Desktop Client installed.<br />
The home machine can not be accessed by ANY machine (regardless of if they have the host and/or client)."</p>

<h2>            Offensive Gamertag&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>My sons gamer tag was banned for being offensive the gamertag in question was NakedSpartan, I have checked the xbox ToS and having read through the code of conduct I am not sure what part he has broken, what makes is more absurd is that it was that is was
 suggested to us through xbl gamertag suggestion tool when you sign up for XBL as the gamertag he wanted was taken.</p>
<p>Can anyone shed some light on why this gamertag might have been banned?</p>

<p>It was probably just because it got a complaint filed on it for some reason. every complaint that is filed is reviewed by an xbox agent that specializes in things like handling complaints. there were either a bunch of people that found it offensive or the
 xbox agent saw the naked part in the name and thought it was inappropriate so he banned it. Nothing big if I recall correctly. I think all you need to do is change the gamertag which I believe you can do for free when its banned for complaints. If you want
 more info on how your sons gamertag was banned feel free to private message me. (little envelope at the bottom of this post) or replying to this post.</p>

<p>If I'm not mistaken, I think the odd part of that story was that the tag was banned, but that the tag was originally suggested by the automatic naming tool itself. &nbsp;In other words, Xbox found a tag to violate the code of conduct that they themselves assigned.</p>

<p>yeah I know it's really weird. I don't fully understand why it would be banned either but that's all I could think of. It may just be because the suggested gamertag was generated electronically and the agent was a real person. or a bunch of people filed
 a complaint on your sons gamertag for some reason and the agent might have thought that some people might find it offensive so he banned it. I really have no idea why it really happened and it is really weird that it happened like that. those are just some
 of the possibilities for why it might have happened.</p>

<p>Its a catch 22 situation for sure. But at least im assuming that you were able to change the gamertag for free seeing as how the profile still has gamerscore and achievements.

<p>If they found the word NAKED offensive it sounds like some people need to grow up no one was acctualy showed naked and Naked Spartan itself is not any kind of sexual refrence. But again the oddest part is that it was auto assigned.</p>

            Hi Gary,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The issue you described could occur due to corrupt Bluetooth driver. I suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check.
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to connect other Bluetooth devices with the tablet?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong></div>
<div>Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter </strong>and check if it helps as it can fix some common issues related to the devices attached to the computer. Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:</div>
<div>a. Press <strong>Windows + C</strong> keys on your keyboard to get the search options.</div>
<div>b. Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</div>
<div>c. Now type <strong>Hardware Troubleshooter </strong>in the search option.</div>
<div>
<p>d. Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter </strong>and follow the prompts to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method </strong><strong>2 </strong></p>
<p>Check if Bluetooth Service is started and set to automatic.<br />
a. On the desktop, press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open the Run Dialog.<br />
b. Type <strong>services.msc</strong> and press<strong> Enter</strong>.<br />
c. Check if the<strong> Bluetooth Support Service </strong>is <strong>started </strong>
and set to <strong>Automatic</strong>.<br />
d. If not, right-click on <strong>Bluetooth Support Service </strong>and select <strong>
Properties</strong>.<br />
e. From the drop-down, select <strong>Automatic </strong>and click on <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3 </strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned under sections: "<strong>Make sure Bluetooth is on"
</strong>and "<strong>Make sure Bluetooth enabled devices and other wireless </strong>
<strong>devices are on and discoverable" </strong>from the following link.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-isnt-windows-finding-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-isnt-windows-finding-device</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4</strong></p>
<p>Run Windows updates and check if you have any pending updates available for the Bluetooth device. If you have any install that and check. You may refer the link below to check for
<br />
updates.<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not going to continue my xboxlive account as I can't put up with all the cheating, it just makes it pointless... ok, more pointless
</p>
<p>Do I have to delete my account to avoid money coming out of my account? Or can I somehow say I don't want to renew and keep what I have achieved so far just incase at any point soon the modding is fixed?</p>
<p>I'd rather not just delete my account as it seems a shame to get rid of the few achievements I have gained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Os</p>

<p>Well, if you have auto-renewal on your account, you will need to change it to Auto-renewal off so you don't have to pay for a new membership. Otherwise, if you just leave the account and don't do anything on it, then you will not have any problems of payments.</p>

 games.</p>

            <p>The company doesn't really support their newer games either. &nbsp;When a new CoD game comes out it's never really very long before someone discovers a cheat in the game and it starts all over. &nbsp;Don't get rid of your live account just because of one game. &nbsp;There are other great live games out there that are supported that you would love if you would give them a try.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Choose How Updates Are Delivered&#34; locks up</h2>
                    Windows 10 Pro x64. Every time I attempt to change advanced options in the "Choose How Updates Are Delivered" area of the Windows update settings (restricting sending updates over the internet), all of the Settings area locks up. I can't close the window,
 can't change the setting, can't get into anything else within the Settings dialog box. Has anyone else experienced this?

<p><strong><em>Original title: Windows Mail in Vista unable to send email, give various server connection errors<br />
<br />
</em></strong>I receive email but sent email which previously was no problem now gets stuck in outbox with various errors.&nbsp; Happening with gmail and aol accounts using IMAP:</p>
<p>An unknown error has occurred. Subject 'abc', Account: 'imap.aol.com', Server: 'smtp.aol.com', Protocol: SMTP, Server Response: '421 Cannot connect to SMTP server 205.188.186.137 (205.188.186.137:587), connect error 10060', Port: 587, Secure(SSL): No, Server
 Error: 421, Error Number: 0x800CCC67</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes for this include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity. Subject 'abc', Account: 'imap.gmail.com', Server: 'smtp.gmail.com', Protocol: SMTP, Port: 465, Secure(SSL):
 Yes, Error Number: 0x800CCC0F</p>
<p>The connection to the server has failed. Subject 'abc', Account: 'Gmail', Server: 'smtp.gmail.com', Protocol: SMTP, Port: 465, Secure(SSL): Yes, Socket Error: 10060, Error Number: 0x800CCC0E</p>
<p>I've made no changes to email settings but still checked all settings, ports, etc. and they are OK to best of my knowledge.&nbsp; Disabled AV and Firewall to no avail, although they didn't interfere to begin with.&nbsp; Tried various fixes noted on this and other
 forums re: authentication and secure password use settings with no success. Tried http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Windows-Mail.</p>
<p>I am left to suspect the latest MS update but would expect more posts about it or that something is corrupted but can't figure out how to find/fix.&nbsp; I've never undone an update before.&nbsp; Could installing the .NET update do this?&nbsp; I had not accepted it before
 thinking I didn't need it but last update I went ahead with it.</p>
<p>Last updates:</p>
Update for Windows Vista for x64-based Systems (KB2158563) and<br />
<br />
Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 for x64-based Systems (KB2416473)

<div>Windows Mail can’t be reinstalled without reinstalling all of Vista.</div>
<div>There is a very laborious way of resetting Windows Mail. Follow this procedure:</div>
<div>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/62560-windows-mail-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/62560-windows-mail-problems.html</a></div>
<div>Scroll down to the section "PROBLEM TWO: How to Backup and Reset Windows Mail"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Frankly, you'd be much better off to simply upgrade to the latest Windows Live Mail:</div>
<div><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-mail?os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-mail?os=other</a></div>
<div>It will automatically import all your Windows Mail data. </div>

<div>Thanks, Gokul T.&nbsp; With all I posted I neglected to say I can delete everything in the outbox and do so before any new attempt to send.&nbsp; The update said it does not apply to my system even though I used the appropriate 64-based one.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I am in the
 process of trying everything else at the link you provided.&nbsp; So far rebuilding the message store has not helped so I'm moving ahead.&nbsp; At least I still receive email so I know when I need to log on to send email from gmail and aol.&nbsp; Do you know if I can reinstall
 Windows Mail?&nbsp; I'm reluctant to spend much more time on this.</div>

<h2>            Windows 8 Messenger App has greyed out status options and doesn&#39;t display contacts</h2>
                    <p>So, I got a new laptop for Christmas with Windows 8 and I was getting used to the new system after working with Windows 7 for so long, it was quite a change. I have pretty much come to grips with everything so far but the Messaging app is confusing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I click on it, "getting info" appears at the top of the screen along with the usual loading dots. I also&nbsp;notice that it displays none of the people in my contact list as "online" - whereas I know they are online through the web-based messenger.
 I also noticed that the status options are completely&nbsp;greyed out, despite having a full connection to the internet.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can load all of my apps, except the ability to chat on messenger, and often the App Store refuses to load too. I've only had Windows 8 for a couple of days and I hate it already.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really need these apps to work. I don't like the web-based messenger and it's very inconvenient to be unable to connect to the App store. Help, anyone?</p>

            <p><span>Hi DizzyHurricane, </span></p>
<p><span>I see that Messenger App has greyed out options and does not display contacts. I will help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>2.Which security software is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3.Are you using a Microsoft account or a Local account?</span></p>
<p><span>4.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Download and run the Modern UI App troubleshooter and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in clean boot and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <span>‘Windows + R’</span> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the <span>‘Run’</span> windows type <span>’MSCONFIG’</span> and click <span>
‘Ok’</span>.<br />
c) Click the <span>‘Boot’</span> tab and uncheck <span>‘Safe Boot’</span> option (if checked).<br />
d) On the <span>‘General’</span> tab, click to select the option <span>‘Selective startup’</span>, and then click to clear the option
<span>Load startup items</span> check box.<br />
e) On the <span>‘Services’</span> tab, click to select the <span>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</span> check box, and then click
<span>‘Disable all’</span>.<br />
f) On the <span>‘Startup’</span> tab, click ‘<span>Open Task Manager’. </span>In the<span> Task Manager window
</span>under<span> startup tab, </span>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<span>Disable’.<br />

<p><span><strong>Step 2:<br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
</strong>a) Press the <span>‘Windows + R’</span> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the <span>‘Run’</span> windows type <span>’MSCONFIG’</span> and click <span>

<span>‘OK’</span>.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <span>‘Restart’</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Refer the help article and check it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>What to do if you have problems with an app</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></span></p>

<p><b><span>Reset store cache.</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Press the Windows key + R</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type: WSReset.exe and click ok.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 5.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Disable the security software temporarily and check if it helps. </span>
</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><b><span> </span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 6.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check in new Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<span>Windows key +W</span>”.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<span>users</span>” without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Then select “<span>Users</span>” from the left panel.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Select “<span>Switch to Microsoft account</span>” right below your user account name.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Enter the required details.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Restart the computer and then try to login using new Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you need further help with any windows issue. We will be glad to help.</span></p>

            <p>My computer is a Samsung Series 3 - 6GB memory with an additional 1TB, with AVG Free Antivirus software. I set up a new Microsoft account when I bought the computer and I am now unable to change to a local account due to an error which I am also unable to
 resolve. Methods 2, 3, and 4 also resulted in no progress. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Method 5, I cannot find an option to disable my software so I am unable to check this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also unable to access any updates from the store. It just loads continuously without ever bringing up any options so I cannot reinstall or update any of the apps.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play downloaded content</h2>
                    
<p>So here the thing:</p>
<p>I had one account and bought several dlc's to TeS: Oblivion. That profile got corrupted so I had to make a new profile.</p>
<p>I bought some more dlc on the new one and played with the dlc owned by the previous account.</p>
<p>Then the red ring stroke and I was sent a new xbox. Troubles starting with the dlc's but I didn't matter cause I played other games at this point.</p>
<p>Recently my girl moved in with me and we moved everything over to her xbox using the wire.</p>
<p><b>The problem that is:</b></p>
<p>Some dlc's are playable on one profile and others on the second but on my partners profile no dlc is available for play? I assume this is because it's not the original xbox but how do you fix this?</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>I have sorted the problem </p>
<p>It looks like I must have invoked the anti theft option in ESET not sure how (I must have been playing around) When invoked it creates a user name if one is not given hence I did not recognize the ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you log into the ESET site under anti theft section you can then see the ID of the local user, you can then remove it if you want to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

3. Have you tried to import photos from a different disk?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">4. Can you check if the option to import comes up in German on a different computer?<br />

                    I use Win10. I want my taskbar to be two rows, but every time I reboot my machine the taskbar is set back to one row. I locked my taskbar in an attempt to prevent Microsoft from changing my setting, but it seems Silicone valley is dead set on taking control

<p>Adding app icons on the taskbar will just make them overflow&nbsp;into&nbsp;another row.</p>

            Thank you for the reply. The problem is that Win10 resets the taskbar to one row. I don't have that many icons that it will overflow. I actually want the taskbar to be two rows because I need fast access to the calendar, date and time at a glance. I resize
 my taskbar to two rows every morning.

<p>Hi Geonerd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Giving access to the contents of a USB drive plugged into the USB port of your router to any computers connected to the network is possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that File Sharing is already enabled on the router page but you still don't have full access to the files on the USB drive, then you may need to map it on your laptop as a network drive. Please see the link
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026635/windows-map-a-network-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Map a network drive</a></strong> for the detailed steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes so I can assist you if further assistance is needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            I have tried all the suggested fixes, but nothing seems to be fixing the problem long term.&nbsp; Getting very close to restoring my PC to Windows 8, as far as I am concerned; Windows 10 is definitely more hassle than it is worth.&nbsp; And is making me consider
 to moving to a Mac, more and more.&nbsp; Totally fed up with Windows 10!<br />

            <p>Thanks for all your suggestions, I have tried all above, including reinstalling windows 10, so it is a question of waiting and see what happens, but I am afraid I don't think it looks good;&nbsp; I have looked at my event viewer after carrying out all suggested,
 and following seem to be a regular occurrence,&nbsp; cortana winning the prizes for the most entries, all bar 1 in the screen dump is Cortana<br />

I wouldn't mind getting rid of Cortana, if it is possible?&nbsp; And I don't use Skye either</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it is another day, and Cortana has upset my PC again!&nbsp; Unless I can disable Cortana, then I'm going back to Windows 8.&nbsp; I have already put my laptop back to Windows 8, as I couldn't run Adobe Lightroom or Bridge on it, after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
