<br />Can you please provide a screenshot of your Hard drive in TreeSize so I can better advice you. Also in that list should be a listing simply called file can you expand that out also . . .<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab50294c-5e19-47a9-9111-4d3d721bac28?upload=true" />

    <title>AHCI or IDE - Don&#39;t know&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamz.z  say:</h3>
<h2>            AHCI or IDE - Don&#39;t know&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>I installed my windows on an SSD along with an 1tb HDD as a secondary storage while having AHCI turned on in bios. I ran into many problems such as the installation freezing and I had to reformat the SDD many times and download the rapid storage drivers
 and manually load them into the windows installation, since it didn't seem to fix this itself.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>After maybe 8 tries using different approaches (safe formatting the SSD before install, different drivers loaded and so forth) I finally managed to get windows installed.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>I have assumed since the install a few days ago that AHCI is working (since i had it turned on before windows install). But I wanted to make sure this is really the case.&nbsp;<br />
I went on the internet and looked through some forums. I read that if you want to test if your AHCI is really working, you can just try to boot the computer with IDE mode On in Bios and if it doesn't start, AHCI is the one that windows is really running.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>So, I tried to boot with IDE instead, to my surprise, windows started fine when I had IDE turned on. I got to the desktop and windows started to install some drivers, so I clicked the "installing drivers" window and I saw that it was installing drivers for
 my SSD.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>Turned AHCI back on and started, it works just as fine as it did before.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>So if it starts with both IDE and AHCI turned on in bios, how the *#¤!% do I know which one windows is correctly running, is there ANY way to check this?</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>I saw that there was an way to change to AHCI after windows-installation by a registry hack. Since the registry hack guide said "Set the registry entry value to 0 and AHCI will be activated" I thought this might be a way to check if it's really working?
 I mean, it should already be set to 0 If I installed windows while AHCI was turned on, right?<br />
I noticed that the entry was set to 3! I had AHCI turned On in Bios before installing windows, why is it not 0? So I Don't have it enabled after all, even though it was on in bios before install?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>By the way,</p>
<p>I had an previus install of windows when I were running IDE, back then I had 7.3 in performance index. Now, when I am 'supposed' to have AHCI on, but it is seemingly not on when looking in the registry, my performance index has still gone up, its 7.8 - So
 it is working?</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>You understand my confusion?</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>And there was a lot of questions here, but what I mainly want answered here is:</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>Does this sound like I don't have AHCI working in windows? How can I check this to be sure? and what could those drivers be that got installed when I tried IDE? And if I actually have to enable it post-install, does this give any negative impacts over having
 it on before install (even though I actually had it on before install)?</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>In 'as ssd' "iaStor" is reported as OK, (this is also supposed to be a sign that AHCI is working according to some forums) see pic:<br />

<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>This is a pic of the registry msahci, as you can see "start" is value=3&nbsp;which&nbsp;it shouldn't be?</span><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>And this is a pic of iaStorV registry entries (i don't know the difference), here the start value is also set to 3:</p>

            Hi, RohitBinjola
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<br />Go to another PC to create bootable media and do this gold standard Clean Install following these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    Metro still buggy it's not an overheating problem.something is wrong with the game and or the latest update and it would appear that it's not going to be fixed as there has been no information on a fix or fixes for the game so far.I know these things can
 take time but at least let us know your actually working together on a fix or something&nbsp;

            Hi sorry you are having issues.&nbsp; The overheating I've experienced with other games on release.&nbsp; It is still very early and I'm sure this is a bug they will fix.&nbsp; You can be proactive in helping though by reporting your issues on the forums, or on twitter
 if you have it.&nbsp; I find twitter a great way to reach out to companies and gaming devs in particular.&nbsp; By reporting your issues and experiences you can help influence what gets fixed.&nbsp;

<p>Yesterday I reinstalled Windows 10 for the third time and requested a phone call from Microsoft so I could get help. They finally called me at 10:30 PM and after going through the problem told me they had to forward me to the networking techs. After being
 on hold for about 30 minutes I got a dial tone. :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had made screenshots that I put into a PDF that I hope someone can figure out what it wrong. I have them on my website at this link:</p>

            <p>I got it to work on my computer, It was a lot of work.&nbsp; I did not have boot issues though.&nbsp; Sounds like a SATA driver issue.&nbsp; But I would never pay that much to get a computer fixed.&nbsp; At that price it is better to pay a little more and get a new computer
 and put your old drive in the new pc as a secondary drive so you can pull your data over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try hitting f8 when you restart to see if it will give you the option to repair.</p>

            IPv4 and IPv6 are not something that you install. They are standards for allocating IP addresses on the internet. How about explaining your problem in non-technical language? Let's start from there.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try changing wireless channel on the router, also turn off any port forwarding you should not need it on that router, only UPnP enabled, if you use both it can cause disconnects</p>

<p>So i took my xbox downstairs to try it wired up to the router but i thought i'd test the wireless beforehand. For some reason it connects perfectly and no disconnects, i played online for around 2 hours.
</p>
<p>I had this same problem just after christmas. I had to take my xbox downstairs just to install updates for skyrim. Eventually it started connecting again upstairs, so im hoping it fixes itself again.

<p>Greetings, Dally1988! It sounds like the issue has been resolved. However, in the case that is hasn't did you try Shad0wman's suggestions? Namely changing the wireless channel on the router and turning off port forwarding? Give that a shot and let us know
 if it helps or if you're able connect successfully. Standing by!</p>

<p>I would first try a hard reset, hold power for 10 seconds while the system is on, then restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This fixes a lot of issues.&nbsp; If not, here is&nbsp; a link that other moderators normally provide with some more support for that error.&nbsp; I hope it doesn't end up in need of repair and can be fixed with some simple troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Occasional Booting Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 on Alienware x51 desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have is that sometimes I am not able to reach the log-in screen. The startup will stuck on one of the booting screens. It could be either the black screen with a flashing cursor, or the screen with the manufacture logo but without the spinning
 loading indicator. If the loading indicator is shown, then for sure it will always start up successfully. Otherwise I have to press the power button to turn off the machine and turn on again. And even turned on again it would get stuck. I have to turn off
 and turn on multiple time to be able to start up and get to the log in screen. But sometime it can start up successfully the first time turning it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the possible cause for this? How should I fix this?</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sure sounds like it could be hardware, such as the hard drive or others. Check with Alienware Support, their on-line documentation, diagnostics, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Or a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service).<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power. Then carefully remove the cards one at time and put them&nbsp;back in their slots. Do the same for the memory and then the cables (on both ends when possible). A loose or&nbsp;corroded connection point can cause strange issues.<br />

<br />
Some troubleshooting you can try :<br />
<br />
Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a
<br />
process of elimination :<br />
<br />
Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin) - at the prompt type in <br />
<br />
MSCONFIG <br />
<br />
and hit enter<br />
<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows&nbsp;- Windows 10 is essentially the same<br />

<br />
<br />
Other programs to help :<br />
<br />
Autoruns - Free - See what programs are configured to startup automatically<br />
when your system boots and you login. Autoruns also shows you the full list <br />
of Registry and file locations where applications can configure auto-start settings.<br />

</span></a><br />
Process Explorer - Free - Find out what files, registry keys and other objects <br />
processes have open, which DLLs they have loaded, and more. This uniquely <br />
powerful utility will even show you who owns each process.<br />

<p>Thanks for providing some tips. I will definitely give them a try. I am using two hard drive. One SSD mainly for the system and one HDD for files and programs. Not sure if this would be the cause. But I have setup the two hard drive for a long time and this
 booting issue just started appearing recently.</p>

Is the SSD the boot drive? If so to thoroughly error test the SSD check with its maker for recommended methods.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Updates no longer works until you have service pack 3 installed. To overcome this problem you need to get to SP3 manually.</span></p>
<p><span>Verify your current service pack level...</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold down the Windows key (between Ctrl and Alt) and hit the Pause Break key</span>
</li><li><span>Examine what is listed in the System: section regarding your service pack level</span>
</li><li><span>Also, make a note of your processor type in the Computer: section (see later)</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>If there is no service pack level designated, first you must download SP2 from...</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28</a></span></p>
<p><span>...and then run the downloaded program to install SP2. You can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft Update if only
 updating one PC.</span></p>
<p><span>As an alternative to SP2 you could download SP1A (xpsp1a_en_x86.exe) from…</span></p>

<span>Daavee</span></a> found.</span></span><span> It is half the size of SP2 so should be quicker. However, as you can see, it is not a Microsoft web site.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have done that, or if you were already at service pack 1, 1A or 2, you can install SP3, but before you do, read this article…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717</a></span></p>
<p><span>…and if your PC is an HP Pavilion, Presario or Media Center and has an AMD processor (see above) you need to install this patch

</blockquote>
<p>Not sure if you're still looking for an answer to this question, but I myself had the pleasure of trying to figure this out...and the reply from MS support engineer was useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out that you do this in the app store. &nbsp;At the top, just left of the search bar you should see your user icon. &nbsp;Click on it and you'll see a dropdown list. &nbsp;One of them is "Settings". &nbsp;In the next screen, scroll down until you see the option for
 "Purchase sign-in". &nbsp;Make sure it is set to off for "Streamline my purchase experience". &nbsp;This option ensures you are asked for your password every time you buy something, including your in-app purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw, I'm running the November update. &nbsp;Can't say if this applies to the previous rev.</p>

<h2>            Upgrading Windows 8.1 SL &#40;OEM&#41; to Windows 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    2 days ago I bought a new lenovo y50 laptop that come with a pre-installed Windows 8.1 SL. And today I decided to upgrade it to Windows 8.1 Pro. So I buy a Windows 8.1 Pro product key (not Pro Pack). But when I try to use it throught the Add Feature option
 it doesn't work. So, can anybody help me with this ? Do I have to do a clean install ? I don't really want to do a clean install on this computer because it will be too much work and I think I won't be able to use my Office 2013 product key (that I bought
 yesterday) because I already used it.

<h2>            All  printing functions stopped after failed Epson XP-312 installation</h2>
                    <div>Win 7 - 64 computer.<br />
<br />
After failed installation of Epson XP-312, all printing functions are now impossible - I can't open Devices and Printers, or "Add Printer". "Print" on progs like Notepad and Paint either crashes the prog. or shows nothing, and Word won't open at all.<br />
<br />
I have tried to remove all traces of Epson - nothing shows now on&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?p=1856008#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 153, 0, 1)">Programs</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimages.intellitxt.com%2fast%2fadTypes%2ficon1.png" /></span></a>.<br />
<br />
I also tried to do a SYstem Restore to before the installation - it *failed*.<br />
<br />
The installation failed both from the CD - on InstallNavi.exe, and, separately, when I tried to install the printer&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?p=1856008#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 153, 0, 1)">driver</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimages.intellitxt.com%2fast%2fadTypes%2ficon1.png" /></span></a>&nbsp;file
 d/l from the Epson site. The installation/unzipping just stopped after the blue line had gone a bit across the page - perhaps immediately after the files had been unzipped.<br />
<br />
The Epson Scan program *succeeded* in installing, and I was able to scan a page into the computer. But I have now removed every trace as far as I can of Epson.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One early symptom, which no longer appears, was that I got: "The Active Directory Domain Services is currently unavailable" box, when fiddling with Print functions, I think.<br />
<br />
Another pos. symptom is that Procexp currently shows:<br />
<br />
GUI.exe<br />
ouc.exe<br />
csrss.exe<br />
winlogon.exe<br />
lsm.exe<br />
<br />
running but with " [Error opening process] "<br />
<br />
I also tried stopping Print Spooler in Local Services - but it didn't make any difference to anything.<br />
<br />
Any help to restore my printing functions v. gratefullly received.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I &nbsp;managed to do a system restore to BEFORE Epson installation - by disabling AVG -</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>but the above non-printing symptoms *still* occur</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did a Malwarebytes scan *and* Ccleaner *and* AdwreCleaner scan -</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>that eliminated many Conduit malware - and have successfully disabled it from Startup</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>but all non-printing symptoms still there</div>

            Hi Ganesh
<div><br />
<div>Thx but yes I tried the Printer problems guide already. The printer is no longer attached, there's nothing in print queue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried Microsoft FixitPrinting but that gets immediately stuck on Check Print Spooler Service errors.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Whenever I open "print" from Notepad &amp; other progs, the prog goes into the endless circle going round and gets stuck, and has to be closed via Procexp. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Notepad may open Print successfully one time after reboot, &amp; occasionally Word has opened after reb oott - but then if I try again, Notepad goes into the stuck circle &amp; Word won't reopen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So there appear to be no standard fixes for this. I've googled and there appear to be a whole lot of variations on print spooler probs, with more sophisticated solutions, though none quite like mine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I presume those progs that alll show Error opening process may be some clue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other thoughts? Would a System Repair from the original disk be worthwhile?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thx again</div>

            Hi
<div><br />
<div>Thx for reply wh. for some reason I have just seen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have already with guidance done a lot of work on this, incl. the steps suggested above.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The situation now is that there appears to be still something wrong with the print spooler - perhaps some registry entry - because</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) i can print via notepad / Word once</div>
<div><br />
<div>but I cannot print a *2nd* time - nor then open Devices and Printers etc - all print related functions are then blocked</div>
<div><br />
<div>but if I try a manual fix:</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) stop Print Spooler in Service and then restart it - I can again print and operate other print related functions</div>
<div><br />
<div>but only one time</div>
<div><br />
<div>All the remedies suggested above don't work - the MS Printer fixit prog. simply hangs when it checks Print Spooler</div>
<div><br />
<div>SO, as I said, &nbsp;this seems to require some print spooler fix - but not the standard ones above. I note from googling that this appears to be a not jncommon problem. Print spooler can go wrong in various ways.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help gratefully received.</div>

            <p>Nice tips, but I already know how Cortana works. I'm wondering if anyone has achieved to turn off the PC with a voice command to Cortana.</p>
<p>
I've tried a few but has no luck.</p>

<p>I have gone to the site but can not download any drivers etc. the issue is I can get to the start screen but can not load my local password as there is no on screen keyboard which used to pop as soon as I touched the screen where the password is typed in.
 Also the WiFi link is not working.</p>
<p>I plugged the HP Stream tablet into my Toshiba laptop usb but the laptop fails to recognise the connection even though the tablet is charging from the laptop.</p>
