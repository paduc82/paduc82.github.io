<h2>            Error 0xc0000001 and NTFS FILE SYSTEM Reboot Loop</h2>
                    <p>My Lenovo ThinkCentre computer has been acting funny since yesterday morning. All of a sudden, the wifi on it goes out. I know the wifi works because it works on my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try all sorts of things to fix it but to no avail. Finally, I try what I believe to be a "hard reset" where you hold the power button on the PC for 15 seconds. However, when it booted back up, and I tried to sign in to it with my PIN, the PC said it was
 wrong when I knew it wasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting one more time, but this time it gave me a BSOD&nbsp;error. Error "NTFS FILE SYSTEM." It tried to restart again like the error screen said it would, but&nbsp;this time, it gave me the 0xc0000001 "Your PC couldn't start properly" error. It has been
 stuck in this loop ever since. Whenever I boot it, it will give me "NTFS FILE SYSTEM" then 0xc0000001.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried pressing F8 from the 0xc0000001 screen, but none of the options there that I tried worked. I tried safe mode and many other options, but the results were exactly the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone help with this problem? I think it&nbsp;<em>might </em>have something to do with when I was trying to fix the wifi issue. I just got this PC and I don't want to lose it. I should mention it was working properly for about half a day, then after I
 woke up the whole ordeal happened. It also came pre-installed with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely fine with a factory reset, as I don't have any important files there. I just can't figure out how to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also took pictures of the first error, second error, and what happens when I press F8 from the second one. Thank you in advance for all your help!</p>

            First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />
<br />Once you are in here try to restore back to a previous system restore point.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you make out.

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            sounds like you HD might need formatting.
<br />You will need to create a bootable USB drive with a clean ISO of windows 10 and boot to that.

<h2>            windows cannot access the specified device, path or file... only BluRay</h2>
                    Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
This was asked to death but I am yet to find an answer that works. Basically, I get the error message "Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You ma not have the appropriate permission to access this item" The item is my BluRay drive. I am
 running a Windows 7 Professional 64x and have not had this problem until recently. The problem is exclusive to when I try to play a media BluRay disc and does not occur when browsing or reading data normally off the disc. It also does not occur when playing
 DVDs or using CDs.<br />
<br />
I have tried the following ad nothing worked:-<br />
<br />
System restore: To different points and did nothing.<br />
Restoring Environmental Variables: Only the PATH as it is the only one I tried tempering with.<br />
Disabling all security applications: Like Windows Firewall, defender and the 3rd party software.<br />
Changing the device's letter: Hoping it might do something if the path was blocked for some reason.<br />
Plain device restart: as it says.<br />
Checking permission settings on my user account: I am the only user on the computer and I am an admin (I would have otherwise been very disappointed in myself)<br />
Trying to use alternate media programs: WMP, Power DVD 10 and 11 and Media Player Classic.<br />
<br />
Please advice cuz this is getting on my nerves in a tromendus way (and probably on the nerves of many others as well)<br />

            <p>Have you ever been able to play "media BluRay discs" or is this a new problem? By media...disc I presume you're referring to movies?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've&nbsp;read in this forum that you will need additional codecs to play Blu-ray movies on Windows Media Player. Personally I've not tried WMP with Blu-ray so I haven't explored "what codecs" - sorry :(
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you used PowerDVD 10 and 11, I'm hoping you completely unisntalled one prior to installing the other (if it wasn't an upgrade process).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Blu-ray&nbsp;player and a writer (2 devices; both LGs) and play Blu-ray movies with my PowerDVD 8 (part of the oem&nbsp;CyberLink Blu-ray Disc Suite)&nbsp;with excellent results. I originally built the machine with only the player; later&nbsp;bought the writer, uninstalled
 the original suite, installed the new&nbsp;writer, installed the new suite and all has been well with no problems. (btw, with commercial programs I've ripped and burned Blu-ray movies successfully)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd suggest you uninstall whatever additional player software you have installed (WPM hopefully will be fine). You might also check the PowerDVD support site for any tips or tools for completely&nbsp;removing their programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CyberLink Support</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cyberlink.com/prog/support/cs/index.do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cyberlink.com/prog/support/cs/index.do</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then from Device Manager uninstall your Blu-ray player and Shutdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you boot Windows 7, it should recognize the new device and load the appropriate drivers. Make sure you check Device Manage to ensure you do not have any problems with the device; in the device's Properties on the General tab it should&nbsp;indicate This
 device is working properly. If not, come back with any error codes or confilicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all is well, install PowerDVD (your choice) and hopefully all is fine for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            As mentioned above, this problem is only recent. I have a whole bunch of codecs installed and have had the same number of media players for as long as I can remember. I think it might be something to do with the codecs I have updated recently which I will
 downgrade and see what happens.<br />
I have, of course, uninstalled the previous version of power DVD before installing the new one (not to mention that the setup file does that automatically for as far as I know)<br />
This seems more probable than a problem with the device as I have tried copying the contents of the disc and playing them off my hard drive, it worked for the copying but not when playing as I got the error message which power DVD reported when trying to play
 BluRay movies off the Disc (not the access error as that only happens in when trying to play off the disc)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />

            Quick Update: Nothing worked. I even tried uninstalling the codec pack I have in addition to PowerDVD.<br />
<br />
Again, please advice.<br />
<br />
PS: I know the device is working properly as I was successful in playing a DVD and using a CD to install software off that very device.<br />

            <p>Just a thought...but maybe the optical drive is malfunctioning. <br />
<br />
Just because it plays CDs and/or DVDs does not insure that <br />
BDs will play (different technology).</p>

            Well, it was able to copy the entire contents of&nbsp; BDs without a hitch, why would it only be unable to play them?<br />
Also, if it is a malfunction, how can I confirm? please advice.<br />

            <p>First...I must state that I'm no expert on optical drives <br />
but would guess the manufacturer of the drive may <br />
have some type of troubleshooting process that <br />
would test the drive.<br />
<br />
When you say 'copy' I'm guessing you mean RIP...<br />
that generates lots of heat and could be the cause<br />
of the current issue.<br />
<br />
Also, there may be a firmware update that would <br />
improve the issue.<br />
<br />
The only way I know of to be certain&nbsp;would be&nbsp;be <br />
replace the drive. <br />
<br />
Not much help I realize but it seems that you have <br />
tried everything else.</p>

            Thanks, I will try and see.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify: By copy I meant a literal Copy-Paste just to see if the driver can go through the data in the disk, and apparently it can. The driver itself was not put in use much as I do not use it often (instead I use my other optical drive that is only
 a DVD drive)<br />
<br />
After I switch off this window I will look to see if there are any Firmware or driver updates available and will post this on the manufacturer's support website.<br />

I would still ask the community for any more suggestions (as manufacturers promise a reply within 24 hours that arrives within 3 decades usually) even if it is to solve this problem in general and not just when it is specific to an optical drive or something.<br />
<br />
Thanks for those who have replied and I will be on the look for any more suggestions.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Updates keep failing and system restore wont work.</h2>
                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I've already posted this in the Windows Updates section, but someone there suggested my problem might be a hijackware issue so I'm posting here instead....
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>For the last few days several of my windows updates have been failing when I try to install them (error numbers include: 800B0100, 80004005, 800703EE, 80246002, 80073712 and possibly more - it's failed a lot of times now) I tried running the updates readiness
 thing but it hasn't changed anything. I've tried system restore but it just sits there doing nothing for ages until it fails with "the creation of a shadow copy has timed out . Try this operation again. (0x81000101)". I'm guessing that this is what is causing
 the updates to fail too as they set a system restore before trying to update...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other symptoms include (not sure if they're related or not):</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Firefox wont open, keeps crashing half a second after it opens if at all. (I usually use Chrome and its fine)</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Kaspersky was all messed up saying that it had something wrong with its database. I re-downloaded&nbsp;the update/definition and restarted kaspersky and it's fine now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Kaspersky thing as well as few things I've read about the error numbers I've got are starting to point towards corrupted hdd or something? I don't know... Any help/suggestions would be rad...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers,</div>
<div>Ben</div>

            <p><span>Hi Ben,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Which updates are getting failed?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to run Windows update troubleshooter and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Open the Windows Update troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a><br />
<br />
<b>Method 2<br />
</b>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following links:<br />
<br />
Windows Update error 80246002<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Update-error-80246002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Update-error-80246002</a><br />
<br />
You receive error code "0x80073712" or the "Windows Features" dialog box is empty when you try to install updates or components in Windows 7 or in Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931712</a><br />

<br />
<b>Method 3<br />
</b>From many users facing the same issue, turning off system restore for the hard disk on which Windows is installed and turning it back on seems to have solved the issue, you may try the same.<br />
<br />
Access the link below and follow the steps to t<strong><span>urn System Restore on or off.</span></strong><b><br />
<strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-System-Restore-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-System-Restore-on-or-off</a><br />
<br />
Note: </span></strong></b>Turning off system protection for a disk deletes all restore points for that disk. You can't restore the disk using restore points until you turn system protection on again and a new restore point is created. Turning off system protection
 also deletes any previous versions of files that were saved for that disk. Previous versions are copies of files and folders that
<span>Windows</span> automatically saves with restore points. For more information about previous versions, see

Previous versions of files: frequently asked questions</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to run SFC Scan.<br />

    <title>How to remove a default program to open a specific .jar file on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronanking  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove a default program to open a specific .jar file on Windows 10 &#40;SOLVED&#41;</h2>
                    I accidentally selected Internet Explorer to open a .jar file before I had downloaded java. I cant seem to remove this and am unable to select java from the application list to reset the default program. I have disabled internet explorer in the control
 panel and 'IE ActiveX Interface Marshaling Library' is now selected. It is vital that I am able to open this file correctly and I am desperate to find a way to remove IE as the default program so that the file is opened with Java.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Refresh Feature - Program Files Folder Contents</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that using the Windows Refresh feature will remove all programs from the computer, but does it delete the files from the Program Files folder?</p>
<p>Does it also delete the files within the AppData folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And does it delete the files for installed programs if those folders are on hard drives other than the C: drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Aka</p>
<p><strong>If I installed Notepad++ to my D: drive and then did a Windows Refresh, Notepad++ will be uninstalled. But will the program files and its contents still be located where ever I choose to install it on my D: drive? Will AppData for my user account
 be reset?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suspect that data might get removed, but I ask this because I am trying to figure out how much data I'm going to need to back up from various program files in order to save configuration information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, does anyone know the extent to which this will affect data on drives other than C:?
</p>
<p>Like if I had a folder located on D: with some files in it, would those also get removed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>There's a small white box that has appeared on the upper left corner of my desktop, and it won't go away. I'm running Windows 10 on a Surface Book 2.&nbsp; When I mouse over the square the spinning 'waiting' circle icon appears but I can't right click it or interact

<p>Hi Kellie, sorry you are having an issue.&nbsp; It looks like you bought a Skype Number subscription which gives you a virtual phone number that others can call to reach you anywhere you are using Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to buy is either Skype Credit or a Skype calling subscription such as a 100 minute subscription to call a particular country.&nbsp; That will allow you to do outbound calling to regular phone numbers from Skype which is what I think you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support is only available via chat.&nbsp; They can refund your Skype Number subscription and you can purchase credit or a Skype to Phone subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

    <title>What is the equivalent of &#34;Disable Edge Swipe&#34; in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevejwrigh9  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the equivalent of &#34;Disable Edge Swipe&#34; in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm experiencing constant annoyance from the way my laptop keeps switching applications on me.&nbsp; It seems that if I am even slightly incautious in the pressure I put on my touchpad, the system reads it as a demand to switch my active window to another application.&nbsp;
 This is, to put it mildly, irritating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back when I was running Windows 8 - which I am now starting to think of as "the good old days" - I was able to prevent this from happening by disabling edge swipes.&nbsp; What is the equivalent in Windows 10?&nbsp; Alternatively, how do I disable this swipe-to-change-apps
 feature?&nbsp; (I change applications by using the task bar or hitting Alt-Tab; it was good enough for my grandfather, it's good enough for me.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I would like to stay in the application I'm currently using, until I want to change it, not switch arbitrarily at the whim of the system.&nbsp; Any advice on this topic would be welcome.</p>

            <p>Hello, and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a little puzzled, though, as the page you've linked me to doesn't actually have any steps to try - it only gives a list of the available multi-finger gestures for a touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it seems that what's happening is that my touchpad - for some reason - is reading a single-finger touch as a multi-finger touch, so it is executing two- or three-finger gestures when I don't want it to.&nbsp; I now have a list of what gestures are being
 executed, but I still have no idea how to stop it executing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Possibly my touchpad is over-sensitive?&nbsp; Again, back in the Windows 8 days, I had a slider in my settings for adjusting its sensitivity - but that option is no longer available in Windows 10, as far as I can see.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the problem remains - my touchpad is executing multi-finger gestures when I only want it to do single finger ones.&nbsp; How do I stop it doing this?</p>

            <p>OK, since I've been prompted to recap this one....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My touchpad is reacting as though I'm touching it with more than one fingertip, even when I'm not.&nbsp; As a consequence, it's executing multi-touch gestures when I don't want it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to stop it doing this, back in the Win8 days, by disabling edge swiping.&nbsp; That option is no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a handy list of the multi-touch gestures which my touchpad is executing - which is helpful, but doesn't actually resolve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ideas I've had, so far are:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; To disable the multi-touch gestures (I never use them on purpose, so it'd be no loss to me), or</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; To adjust the sensitivity of the touchpad so that it no longer registers floating dust motes as fingertip touches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if anyone could tell me how to do 1 or 2, or can offer any option 3 which might solve my problem, I'd be very much obliged.</p>

    <title>User Folder Eating Up Hard Disk Free Space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1borland  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Folder Eating Up Hard Disk Free Space</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 64GB SSD which is slowing decreasing the available free hard disk space.&nbsp; I should only be using about 1/2 the capacity, however I'm now down to 3GB of remaining space.&nbsp; I noticed this a few weeks ago, but the available space was much larger then.&nbsp;
 So the problem has progressed to this point of running out of free space.</p>
<p>Using the Windows Explorer file manager, I find my 'User' folder now&nbsp;takes up 33.3GB of space. User has two folders (user_me, and public). Most of these GB's&nbsp;are&nbsp;for user_me. &nbsp;But the data files in this folder are only taking up about 2GB.</p>
<p>How much User data should I expect to see being taken up by Windows, and can I resolve this to something more practical?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>cCleaner?&nbsp; No thanks.&nbsp; I'm sticking with Windows Disk Cleanup.</p>
<p>Well, my problem was fixed by deleting 'Temporary Internet Files' from within IE8 (using the General Tab of&nbsp;Tools-Internet Options menu).</p>
<p>I also found&nbsp;in IE8's Internet Options, Advanced&nbsp;Tab, a configuration setting&nbsp;to empty&nbsp;'Temporary Internet Files' folder when&nbsp;the browser is closed.&nbsp; Enabling that&nbsp;should permanently keep the folder from growing too large later.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t print to default printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ernielane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t print to default printer</h2>
                    
<p>I went away for a couple of weeks, and turned my printer (HP all-in-one) off.&nbsp; When I came back and turned it on, I have a printing problem that I can't figure out.&nbsp; I have troubleshooted the printer and chatted with HP several times, and I think whatever
 problem there is, is with Windows 7 and not the printer.</p>
<p>Some "symptoms":</p>
<p>- When I try to print something, I get all the right windows that indicate that it's printing normally.&nbsp; However, nothing prints.&nbsp; When I look at 'what's printing,' the document status is blank.&nbsp; In the past, if I had a printing problem. it usuially was
 hung up with status 'printing.'&nbsp; Status blank is a new one on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp; So I cancel printing.&nbsp; The cancellation happens almost instantaneously; whenever it was hung up in the past, cancellation always took several seconds.</p>
<p>- So I delete the printer and reinstall it.&nbsp; It works fine UNTIL I REBOOT.&nbsp; Then I have to go through everything again.</p>
<p>- Now, when I install the printer, I am given a choice to use the installed driver or to replace the current driver.&nbsp; Thinking I might have a driver problem. I choose to replace it.&nbsp; But the installation goes through with the current driver anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It's a wireless printer, but I don't think that matters.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><span>Hi ErnieLane,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you tried all the steps provided by “<strong>Syed N</strong>” in the previous post?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not tried all the steps from the previous I would suggest that you try those steps and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that fails then I would suggest that you manually download and install the printer drivers, check if that work.</span></p>

<h2>            How to edit the sendto menu for all users in windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After researching through most online forums, I understand I can edit the sendto menu for a certain user by adding program shortcuts to the following folder path:</p>
<p>C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo</p>
<p>My question is how do I edit the sendto menu for ALL users? I thought there might be a folder like such</p>
<p>C:\Users\All Users\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo</p>
<p>but it is not there. Can anyone shed some light on this issue?</p>

            I think you have to do that manually by going to each user's folder.

<p>Are you sure? Is there a programmatic way to do this?</p>
<p>I was hoping to be able to achieve this effect by adding shortcuts through a visual studio installer project, but it doesn't look that easy at this point.</p>
<p>I can not believe that there is absolutely no way to edit all users sendto menu. Can someone from Microsoft confirm that it is not possible? I need to know because I need to reply to a customer request. Please help. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Skype app dials but never connects and hangs</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10. Using they Skype app. </p>
<p>
</p><p>App launches fine. I can message people no problem. When I click on the Skype Test call, the system dials and keeps ringing but the system never answers. Sometimes if I click the hang-up button, the app essentially hangs but it keeps ringing like it's trying
 to connect. Sometimes, if I click the hang-up button many times quickly, the app crashes. If I call someone else, the same thing happens. If someone calls me, I click the answer button but the call never answers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled cleaned the registry and reinstalled the app. </p>
<p>I've updated flash (read that somewhere). </p>
<p>I've tested my account on other computers and it works fine so it's not the account.
</p>
<p>The computer is relatively new (2 months old) so it doesn't have a lot of crud in the system.</p>
<p>Audio is working because I can hear the ringing. </p>
<p>Video works in the settings panel. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried other suggestions from other sites (can't remember all the steps but I deleted skype folders).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm out of ideas. It seems like a resource conflict or something but I don't know how to figure that out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated. I've wasted way too much time on this and I need Skype to get some work done.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Erich,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to identify if it's specific to this Skype version only, I am requesting you to download the Skype for desktop version and let me know the result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the Skype for desktop version on this link: <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a>. On the dropdown, select <strong>Get classic Skype.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and installed Skype Classic (didn't know I could do that). It installed ok. When it started for the first time, I logged in and heard the skype start-up wave. Then it took me to the Setting up Skype page to configure my sounds card, mic and
 video. When I click Test Sound, nothing plays and there is an error "Can't access your sound card". Microphone says can't detect sound card but it should be using the mic in the camera. Video is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to reboot to see if that helps. </p>

<p>This is a Vista forum, but XP works pretty much the same in this situation (as I used XP ever since it was released and still have another computer using XP and clients who still use XP).&nbsp; You probably don't have to reboot; however, you may need to disconnect
 from the&nbsp;network (local and/or internet) and then re-establish the connections so the new DNS entry is recognized.&nbsp; Actually, you can check after the change by going to Start / All&nbsp;Programs / Accessories / Command Prompt and typing ipconfig /all and entering
 and then checking the connections and seeing if the new DNS entry appears.&nbsp; If so, you don't even need to re-establish the connection or reboot as&nbsp;the new DNS entry&nbsp;is showing up.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that does not work (it doesn't show up in ipconfig /all AND re-establishing
 the connections didn't get it to be added (you can check ipconfig /all after reestablishing the connections as well) and you know that the change will resolve the problem (whatever it is) and need it to be added, then reboot to see if that helps (but again,
 I do not believe it is required although re-establishing the connections may be necessary).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, I would just check ipconfig /all to verify if the new entry is there.&nbsp; If not re-establish the connections and check ipconfic /all again.&nbsp; If still not there, then reboot.&nbsp; If still not there, then the addition did not work and you need to verify
 it is correct and try adding it again.</p>

    <title>New build 10565 allows activating Upgrade directly with Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg carmack - mvp 2010-2020  say:</h3>
<h2>            New build 10565 allows activating Upgrade directly with Windows 7&#47;8&#47;8.1 key</h2>
                    <p>From Insider Hub announcement today:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Device activation improvements:</em></strong><em> We have received a lot of feedback from Insiders on making it easier to activate Windows 10 on devices that take advantage of the free upgrade offer to genuine Windows by using existing Windows
 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 product keys. If you install this build of the Windows 10 Insider Preview on a PC and it doesn’t automatically activate, you can enter the product key from Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 used to activate the prior Windows version
 on the same device to activate Windows 10 by going to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation and selecting Change Product Key. If you do a clean install of Windows 10 by booting off the media, you can also enter the product key from prior Windows versions
 on qualifying devices during setup. For more information on these activation improvements including requirements – see this post in the Insider Hub.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked in MVP Communications channel of the Windows 10 team if there is any way for consumers to avail themselves of this feature without waiting for the build's public release.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Response is that if you have presently a Windows 10 Upgrade that fails to activate, you can opt-in to Insider Builds, upgrade to build 10565, then insert Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product key in Activation Settings, or after reboot it should pick up an embedded
 Windows 8.1 Product Key on Factory OEM. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To opt-in to Insider builds, go to&nbsp; Settings&gt;Updates &amp; Security&gt;Update&gt;Advanced Options&gt;Get Insider Builds, select Get Started:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76bc08b9-dafe-45e6-979c-394e952f2566" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then we've learned that one can <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-clean-reinstall-windows-10/11ccc09e-eefa-4bcc-80d9-d3d0d249587d?tm=1444962888069">
Clean Install Windows 10</a> directly using Build 10565 creating the media from the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO</a>, then directly activate at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Activation with Product Key from Windows 7, 8, or 8.1, if necessary restart to autodetect embedded key for Factory Installed 8 or 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reports coming in the past few days confirm that this works and that from Build 10565 you can even Go Back to Windows 10 in the Advanced Windows Update settings from a link below the greyed-out button to Opt-Out of Insider Builds.&nbsp; This returns you to the
 Windows 10 release version with activation intact.&nbsp; We're waiting to see if in every case this requires Saving Nothing, but remember that a Clean Install is always the best install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for keeping this thread updated!&nbsp; And special thanks to the consumer-friendly Windows 10 Team for valuing the vastly superior Clean Install in this way, and by previously allowing a Reset Saving Nothing to automate a Clean Reinstall of bloated factory
 pre-installed Windows 10! </p>

Change Win 7 Home 32 bit to 64 bit before upgrading to Win 10 - Microsoft Community</a> :</p>
<p>
<em>"When I went to the Update &amp; Security/Windows Update/Advanced Options, the Insiders Build box was already selected and grayed out, so it couldn't be de-selected. Underneath was a link saying something like "How can I opt out of Insiders Build". That link
 takes you to a screen that explains that you have to reinstall a regular version of Windows, then offers hyperlinks to Windows 7, 8.1, and 10. It never required a disc be inserted into the drive and downloaded the online upgrade that I selected. There wasn't
 a choice of which version of Windows 10 or whether I wanted 32 or 64-bit. There was a screen that informed me that clean install was my only option. Once the install began, there was a brief black boot type screen that seemed to offer a choice of Windows 7
 or 10, but I just caught a quick glimpse and can't say how long it was up. Seemed to be just a second or two. After that, the install progressed as normal. There wasn't a screen to enter the product key and the final result is a registered version of &nbsp;Windows
 10 Home, 64-bit. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Like you mentioned, this does appear to be a viable workaround for a clean install while using your original key."</em>

<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try right-clicking on a photo (jpeg) file, click on open with. Look for photoshop from the list. Then check always use this program for opening this type of file. I'm not sure that's the exact wording though. Then click OK.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. What type of connection do you have (wired or wireless)?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong><span>I would suggest you to run SFC scan to check for missing or corrupted system files.<br />
</span><span>Run System File Checker (SFC) scan to fix any corrupt system files. To do this, follow the steps mentioned in the link :<br />
<span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a><br />
</span><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may perform a clean boot and check if any software conflict is causing the issue.<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
&nbsp;Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above Knowledge Base article.</p>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>You may also run a Microsoft safety scanner to make sure computer is free from virus infection:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
Disclaimer:<br />
If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 4:<br />
</strong>I would also&nbsp;like to inform that usage of CPU depends on other factors as well like the programs and processes running on the computer. Refer the links:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/View-CPU-utilization-and-other-performance-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/View-CPU-utilization-and-other-performance-information</a><br />

 updated to the may update 1903 and found that I didn't like it. It slowed my pc down and caused a lot of my already existing apps to not perform properly. I tried to uninstall the update through the troubleshoot&gt;advanced options&gt; uninstall updates. After the
 process was complete my pc claimed there wasn't any OS of any sort on it, that I needed to reinstall. So i tried to reinstall from a usb drive I have a copy of my OS on, but now I get this message: "No signed device drivers were found.&nbsp; Make sure that the
 installation media contains the correct drivers, ave then click OK."&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I created the back up after three first time I had to reinstall. The usb has been sitting in a drawer in a plastic case. So it's untouched.&nbsp; Can someone please help.&nbsp; P.S. the photos are of the message I received and the device with my backup OS contained
 in it.</p>

            Hi Iz.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The Version Rollback is at Settngs &gt; Update &amp; Secuirty &gt; Recovery or from the Repair Mode using one of these methods to access it :  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You only needed to ask us.  
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Go back.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 went with a clean install and this was the result. I don't understand how 465.8gb of space is too small.&nbsp; Now I'm really freaking.&nbsp;

            I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands,  each followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps in the first link tutorial to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the first linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Well. Now I have to find a another computer.&nbsp; I did the command prompt steps and the drive I cleaned was the usb drive containg the OS on it. So I'm going to go and release some stress on Xbox before I need to replace my hardware as well

            Thx. Went through all steps and got it working. But when i tried the 1903 update from the website it failed. Almost completed the install and said my device (basically) couldn't run it. Then it reversed the update. Now i keep getting&nbsp; "critical process
 died and it restarts to the "no boot device found" . I shut down and power back on and it loads (slowly) but does load. I don't understand why I'm having so many problems. My machine meets the requirements for the update(but i guess that's another issue).
 Thanks for your help.

            Yes i created install media, and it loaded the 1803(?) Patch, then said 1903 was ready, attempted to install it and failed. I wish windows 7 was still supported. That was their best os. But I'm not trying to update past 1803/9(don't quite remember the
 numbers). Trying to optimize the settings for the build i have now. Thanks for the advice.
