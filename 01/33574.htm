<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, the <strong>AllUsers</strong> folder is not an actual folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a <strong>Symbolic Link</strong> that redirects to the <strong>C:\ProgramData</strong> folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ProgramData</strong> is not hidden, by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct syntax for the Attrib command would be,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\&gt;attrib -h ProgramData</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can <strong>Unhide</strong> all folders by going to <strong>Organize\Folder and Search options\View tab</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Hidden files</strong> <strong>and folders</strong> section, place a
<strong>check mark</strong> in the<strong> Show hidden files,folders, and drives</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Apply/OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>windows 10 install frozen with no cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johett  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 install frozen with no cursor</h2>
                    I'm installing the public release version of Windows 10. It has frozen on the Hi there, welcome back! screen. There is no cursor. I hit Enter and nothing happens.&nbsp; It's been at this stage for 20 minutes. There is still no cursor. The only option appears
 to be a forced reboot. Would doing this corrupt the installation?

            <p>A breakthrough. I connected a different mouse and the cursor appeared. The original mouse was cordless. The replacement mouse is corded. If your keyboard is cordless you will need to temporarily replace it with a corded one. Windows will take another 10
 minutes to finish installing. You will then need to recognize both devices via the bluetooth devices option.</p>

    <title>Normandy SR-2 Layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimieva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Normandy SR-2 Layout</h2>
                    
<p>Have you ever noticed that the architecture makes no sense at all, unless the elevator turns sometime between decks 2 and 3, and then again between decks 3 and 4? If we consider Joker's seat on the bridge to be north, you head south through the CIC to the
 elevator. The elevator doors face north. If you head further into the ship, you can see in the Science Lab and the Armory the windows that show you the Engine Core in the far south of the ship.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
When you arrive on deck 3, the doors should open north, towards the forward batteries and the sleeping pod corridor. But they do not. They open SOUTH, towards engineering. You can confirm this by the fact that Life Support and the Crew Quarters both have windows
 to the Engine Core. If you go to deck 4, the doors now open north again, and Engineering is now to the south once more. You can also confirm this by the fact that Grunt is the Port side Cargo area on Deck 4 (to the left as you exit the elevator) and Kasumi
 is the Port side Observation area on Deck 3 (to the right as you exit the elevator).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
For this to make any sense, the elevator has to twist while descending. Once while moving between decks 2 and 3, and again between 3-4. A careful inspection of the elevator easily reveals that it does not have doors on its south side. The south side is occupied
 by the control pedestal.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Just something I was pondering while exploring the ship tonight.</p>

 the elevators, so obvious that most didn't notice, one very clear example of some of the downsizing that took place since the first game...:-)</p>

<p>North......really? North of what? You're in bloody space there's no planetary gravitational field.....and what if the Normandy faces South-East? On NO!!!! Time to change the way the doors open.....actually we need to turn them 45 degrees!!! I didn't know
 doors "should" open in any speciffic way.....what's this nonsense? US Navy tradition or something based on ships that float on water or what? Seriously.....170+ years in the future nobody cares, they're just bloody doors, get over it.</p>

<p>Both ends of the elevator can open except whichever door isn't blocked on that specific floor, can't walk through walls.....the end. There is no set way as to which end "should" open and there is no bloody north and south.</p>

<p>Actually, both ends cannot open on the elevator. Look carefully inside the elevator. One side has the controls, the other has the doors. It's not like the Normandy SR1 where the controls were on the side, the SR2 elevator places the controls on a pedestal
 in the middle of the wall. There is only a single set of doors. Also, the north/south directions were for a frame of reference, nothing more. It wasn't meant to be a literal direction. If you desire an exact terminology, call north the fore of the ship and
 south the aft of the ship and nothing about my description is altered.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 S E64 ERROR - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emuzevfx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 S E64 ERROR</h2>
                    
<p><span>I got the 360 Slim about 7 months ago. And I didn't buy a new hard drive so I took my old xbox one apart and put the actual thing that is the hard drive into the slim. fits fine. But lately I've been getting E64 and E68 error messages. Mostly E64.
 The hard drive inserted fully into the xbox. Without the hard drive, the xbox plays fine. I'm not going to play with 4GB of memory. Since most of my games are saved onto the hard drive. Last night, I was able to play. Any help? Do I need a new hard drive?
 Thanks&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thetechgame.com%2fimages%2fforums%2fsmiles%2ficon_smile.gif" /><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hey, well that is your problem. If you've opened the console and changed it's hardware in anyway then you've voided the warranty. And if your old Xbox was not a slim, then that might have something to do with the fact that you are getting errors, because
 it's not a proper Xbox Slim piece of hardware.</p>

<p>It's only December 4, but all my progress on the "Daily Viewer" has been wiped!&nbsp; When I go back to the Calendar, to inspect Daily Challenges, they have been done!&nbsp; Just that the points in the December timeline are not there!.&nbsp; The same thing happened to
 be last month! When is this going to be fixed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The time wasters have been set up, and then having used them, and complied with them, the program takes everything away!&nbsp; For us CDOs (OCD in alphabetical order, as it should be) that's ***!</p>
<p>At the moment, cause I haven't played Solitaire's Daily Challenges, my comments apply to Minesweeper only!</p>
<p>Stay tuned, because I haven't played the Solitaire Daily Challenges!</p>

<p>This has just happened to me again. Lost 10 days worth of data, and the annoying this is I can't go back and redo the games as I already have the point. This happened last month on a number of the games I have can't remember which ones (def minesweeper and
 solitaire). So frustrating, you have to wonder what is the point of achievements if it gets wiped all the time.</p>

<h3> guitarman 53959  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Network Places in Vista&#63;</h2>
                    Windows XP had a feature called "My Network Places" where I could enter a specific&nbsp;folder on&nbsp;our server and quickly navigate to that position.&nbsp; So far in Vista, I cannot find a similar function.&nbsp; I have to go to Network, then the first folder, then a subfolder,
 then another subfolder, then another subfolder, etc. until I finally get to the actual files.&nbsp; And I have to do this every time.&nbsp; Surely there is a better way?&nbsp;

            IMHO, Microsoft was smart to remove "My Network Places" in Vista.&nbsp; It never worked reliably in XP.<br />
<br />
You can create a desktop shortcut to a shared folder:<br />
<br />
1. Right-click an empty spot on the desktop.<br />
2. Click New &gt; Shortcut.<br />
3. Specify the location of the item as "\\computer\share" or "\\computer\share\folder\...\folder"<br />
4. Click Next.<br />
5. Type a name for the shortcut.<br />
6. Click Finish<br />
<br />
You can create your own Vista version of My Network Places by keeping all such shortcuts in one folder on your desktop.<br />

            This worked best for me.&nbsp; I set up a new folder called "000 Network Shortcuts" in Documents so it is the first folder at the top of the list.&nbsp; Then I created the shortcuts to the server locations as you described.&nbsp; Now when I go to open a file, the program
 looks at Documents and I am two clicks away from where I need to be [1-000 Network Shortcuts; 2-Actual location].&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

<p>Hello 1287nakolwe!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for using the xbox forums, let's get started with some basics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using the correct email that is used to setup your microsoft account?<br />
</p>
<p>On what device are you setting your xbox live account from? PC, Mobile, console?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, how are you trying to connect? WIFI or Ethernet(wired)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tested your network first to check if your 360 is connected to the internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can confirm these first we can better troubleshoot your issue.&nbsp;</p>

For whatever reason is does not show up in my console captures but when I click manage captures they pop up, but I am unable to share them with anyone, a error message keeps popping up saying 'Sorry, you are unable to share this at this time.'

            <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>An outdated version of the Xbox Beta 
app and Xbox Live server interruption are possible reasons as to why 
you're encountering this issue. Kindly answer the following questions and we'll advise the best approach in resolving this issue:
<ul><li>Have you made any changes to your device before encountering this issue?</li><li>Have you tried sharing other game captures to check if the same issue occurs?</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>In the meantime, we recommend running the Windows apps troubleshooter provided on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>. This can help resolve issues regarding applications downloaded from the Windows Store.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>To check if there are updates available for the Xbox Beta app, kindly follow the steps provided on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/b5e4e2e4-cc9d-47ef-8782-7a1c81e735ef/check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games-from-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>We also suggest keeping your device up-to-date.

<p>Another solution you may perform is to reset the Xbox app from Settings. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol><li>Click <strong>Start </strong>and click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Find the <strong>Xbox Beta app</strong> and click <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device so that the changes can take effect.</li><li>Launch the application and check if you'll encounter the same issue.

            Hi Imago.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this the WIndows 10 Product Key on an official COA sticker which has the licensed version on it so you know which version (Home or Pro) it will work on?   Do you know for sure you installed the correct version?  
<br />
<br />Have you tried inserting the Product Key into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.  What does it report on the Activation settings page under Status and Edition?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Where did you get that 10 digit security code, a Windows 10 Product Key has 25 characters

<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Freezing after 60 minutes Up Time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgebirch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Freezing after 60 minutes Up Time</h2>
                    <p>With a Laptop Toshiba Satellite A205 (2MB RAM &amp; 250GB SSD) operating with Windows &nbsp;8.1 Pro working perfectly, I upgraded to Windows 10 (took 2.5 hours). During this process several files were removed by Microsoft (unfortunately I did not note which ones).&nbsp;
 Initially everything appeared to work perfectly with Windows 10. It also ran significantly quicker than before which was encouraging. &nbsp;However, after 60 minutes of bliss the screen freezes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a further +/- 8 minutes a light blue screen (white text) appears stating:</p>
<p>:(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We are just collecting some error info, and then we’ll restart for you. &nbsp;(0% complete) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Note: never changes from 0% complete)</p>
<p><em>If you’d like to know more, you can search on line later for this error:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p><em>KERNAL DATA INPAGE ERROR</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer then attempts to restart but freezes after a few seconds.&nbsp; Around +/-3 minutes later a black screen (white text) appears stating:</p>
<p><em>Yukon PXE v5.16.1.3 (20060811)</em></p>
<p><em>(c) Copyright 2003-2006 Marvell (R) All Rights Reserved.</em></p>
<p><em>Pre-boot eXecution Environment (PXE) v2.1</em></p>
<p><em>(c) Copyright 1997-2000 Intel Corporation PXE-E61: Media Test Failure, check cable</em></p>
<p><em>PXE-MOF: Exiting PXE ROM</em></p>
<p><em>Operating System not found</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The only solution is to hit the on/off button for 10 seconds.&nbsp; Then restart the machine to repeat the above process ad infinitum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A day later, after many more freezes, I reverted to Windows 8.1 (took 10 minutes). Initially, everything looked and behaved as before upgrade to Windows 10. However, after +/-60 minutes, exactly the same screen freezes occurred
 followed by the same blue and black screens and identical text. &nbsp;Before, this freeze occurs, the computer works perfectly with email, internet, office programs, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the Task Manager Up Time, the five of the most resent freezes have occurred at 1:00:45, 1:00:58, 0:59:50, 1:00:46 and 1:00:42, so virtually exactly on the hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is going on? How do I correct it?</p>

            The problem was sorted by Crucial. &nbsp;The firmware Version 0009 of the Crucial Model M4-CT256M4SSD2 was causing the SSD to freeze after a fixed time usually of the order of 30 to 40 minutes, but in my case 60 minutes. This apparently was a known fault &nbsp;that
 occurred after around 5000 hours operating time. When the firmware version was changed to 070H the issue was resolved.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Echo450,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us today! This tends to happen when a game requires an update. More than likely Halo 5 is needing a current update for the installation to fully go through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go ahead and go over our article <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/game-installation-process-stops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"The installation process stops at or near 0% when installing an Xbox One game from a disc"</a>.</p>
<p>

            ah ok, I’ll give that a try when I have a good enough internet connection. Our internet is pretty garbage where I live here in australia because I live in a rural area (and because telstra is ripping us off) so I’ll give it a try when I’m near a stronger
 connection

<p>You should be able to install what is on the disc while in offline mode, just make sure that you take your console into offline mode and have stopped and uninstalled Halo 5 before you try installing in offline mode.</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>Also check to see if there are any scratches or dirty marks on the disc (the shiny side in case you were wondering)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note the full size of Halo 5 is around 100 GB.</p>

            I'm running 1703 and there is no GO BACK TO PREVIOUS VERSION. I have only "Reset this PC" -&gt; Get Started where I get to choose 1. Keep my files but will delete all my apps and settings, but keep my files OR remove everything and 2. is Advanced Setup where
 there are a number of options other the much needed GO BACK TO PREVIOUS VERSION. I have a new laptop and am unable to install the printer software for my HP Color Laser.&nbsp;

<h2>            laptop detecting movement while lid is closed</h2>
                    <p>My Hp 15n-204tx&nbsp; is almost five years old. And since the date, I have noticed that when<strong> my laptop lid is closed and if I hold it vertically, it stops playing music and HDD indicator also turning red (task pause) from white (normal)</strong>. But
 when lid is open, its all fine no matter in which angle I hold it. The moment I again reposition it normally, resumes playing music. I can't detect if its a feature or a fault, but two of my friends who bought the same model, face same thing. Can anyone tell
 me why this happens? if this is for any sensor or something?</p>
<p>Note: My laptop doesn't have a single issue regarding anything and I'm using latest Windows 10 October update smoothly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I am completely aware that this community is only for OS related issues, but still I'm posting it because I'm so much driven by enthusiasm.</p>

            HP laptops have driveguard which ‘braces’ the hard drive when it detects the device is potentially falling to prevent damage.
<br />HP 3D DriveGuard protects your hard drive against rough handling, excessive vibration, and other everyday wear and tear; so when an accident happens, you can go on working. It relies on a three-axis digital accelerometer that acts as a motion sensor, which notifies the system software of any sudden movement and sends a command to temporarily park the hard drive, protecting your critical data from impacts, bumps and minor drops.
<br />I hope this answers your question.
