<p>Is there any api to microsoft family?</p>
<p>I found that request to prolongate time for child is something like:</p>
<p>https://account.microsoft.com/family/approve-time-request/?request=XXX</p>
<p>where XXX is base64 json:</p>
<p>{"childId":"YYY","originalLockTime":"2018-02-04T19:32:16.4970000+00:00","duration":"00:30:00"}</p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons which can cause this error in your computer. One of these is a corrupted or missing system file. You may run the
<span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker</a></span></span> to identify
 and troubleshoot this error.</p>
<p>

 any update errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Please perform the Clean boot on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot temporarily disables all third party applications as well as all Microsoft non-essential services so only basic drivers will run. This will help us find any third-party software which can be the cause of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From <strong>Start</strong>, search for msconfig</li><li>Select <strong>System Configuration</strong> from the search results.</li><li>On the Services tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click <strong>
Disable all</strong>.</li><li>On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click Open <strong>
Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the Startup tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.</li><li>Close Task Manager.</li><li>On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then restart the computer.</li></ol>

<h3> callan mcallister  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;The Specified Service has been marked for deletion.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>So as a gamer, I play the game battlefield 4. Battlefield uses an anti cheat service called punkbuster and I have been running into some problems since upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So punkbuster has 2 services that run in the background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>PnkBstrA and&nbsp;PnkBstrB&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the Problem I've been having is that the&nbsp;PnkBstrB service will not start Which results in me being kicked from the game as soon as I join a server. So I go into task manager and go to services to try and manually start it, but when I click start I get
 this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/StCIms0.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/StCIms0.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I go to the services window and open the properties of PnkBstrB and it is indeed disabled. So I try to select for it to automatically start (as PnkBstrA is and as many forums have told me to do) but when I do that I get an error saying&nbsp;"The Specified
 Service has been marked for deletion."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can only assume that windows is mistaking punkbuster for a virus or something and deleting it, the problem with this theory is that I have been in windows firewall and given Punkbuster as much access as I can and I keep getting this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be much appreciated as I have been trying to fix this for upwards of 3 days with no result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Callan McAllister</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that one of the services associated with the game is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed, if its a Windows service might check the event log for more error details. If it is third party service you may need to get in touch with developer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would suggest you to check for the registry entry for the specific service and check for the status.</p>
<p>Navigate to : <strong>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\YourService\DeleteFlag</strong>.</p>
<p>Check for the the DeleteFlag&nbsp;entry of this service in Registry and check if&nbsp;it is there is&nbsp;and the value is set to "1". If it is, reset it to "0" and check for the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below recommended methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>However, based on this severity of this issue, if it is some third party application to be causing the issue and arising conflicts, I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean Boot state and see if it helps. Follow below.</p>
<span><span>A.
</span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called <strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span>
<p><span>Follow:
<span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to
 reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur
 when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform
 a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if
 the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span><span>B.
</span>To disable any 3<sup>rd</sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Add&nbsp;the program to the Windows Firewall exceptions list and check if it is Windows that is stopping the service to run in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the above recommendations did not help, I would suggest you to reinstall the game and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to us and we would be happy to assist you further.</p>

</p><p>Thank You</p>

    <title>Microsoft Xbox Accounts - Old Email &#47; New Email - Multiple account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Xbox Accounts - Old Email &#47; New Email - Multiple account mess</h2>
                    <p>Asking in your support, but sadly no help there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the common situation many of your customers run into :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Many of us signed up for Xbox live when you started years ago with a Hotmail account.</p>
<p>- Hotmail was closed many years ago (doesn't exist any more).</p>
<p>- We could add an "alternate email" to our account for Xbox Live so we could still use our gamertag + friends + history etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; I did this with gmail.</p>
<p>- Along comes Windows 10 and requires you log in with a valid email.</p>
<p>- Your Hotmail account no longer "exists", so you can't use that.</p>
<p>- So you use your Gmail account.</p>
<p>- You now get a NEW Xbox Live account with your valid email.</p>
<p>- Windows 10 now cannot associate properly with your original gamertag - so many games / sites (Sea of Thieves for instance) will try to use the wrong gamertag that is associated with your new email.</p>
<p>- Additionally if you buy something with your windows 10 account and want to say go use it on your xbox (like Sea of Thieves), you aren't going to be able to do that, because it's associated with the wrong gamertag.......OR if you do something stupid and
 redeem the digital code for it on the Xbox, you can't use the PC version of it because it's not associated with your windows account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are MANY of us stuck in this dilemma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) We do not want to "start over" with the new account, since we have history + friends + gamertag + purchases (cross play) since inception of Xbox Live.</p>
<p>2) Your company offers no way to "Merge" the accounts together.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I can't have my history + gamertag + friends + purchases moved to the REAL email account.</p>
<p>3) Windows 10 won't let me sign on with an email that isn't real.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Your support is suggesting changing the "primary" email from my Hotmail account to something new.&nbsp; &nbsp;But guess what?&nbsp; That deletes my Windows 10 and all purchases on the current email!!! (Why in the world would I want to do that?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So because your company has no option or way to merge accounts, many of us are stuck in a dual login situation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can you not fix this for us?&nbsp; &nbsp;Why is this so difficult behind the scenes?</p>

            If you read above, that is what I did.&nbsp; &nbsp;This isn't so much a gamertag problem as it is an account merge / link problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have two microsoft accounts, and you have no way to merge them.

<p>So your response to help with this situation boils down to :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Nothing Microsoft can do to fix this situation with user IDs / Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the Xbox team also can't collaboratively work with their own internal Microsoft teams to fix this, then you should give feedback (that goes no where) that they should "Get better".</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, you're saying that you've got no way to fix this, no process to support it, and no reason to prioritize this above any other fixes or issues - because it really doesn't make a difference in the long run for the "inconvenience".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your company does realize this is why you have low NPS scores with customer service right?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Teredo Tunneling Network Driver. How to reinstall missing driver&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>System description: Vista Business; Trend Micro</p>
<p>As I was getting an error message (triangle) in Device Manager and was unable to update the Teredo Tunneling Network Driver, I uninstallled it thinking that it would reinstall automatically when I shut down and restart. Unfortunately, it did not happen that
 way. The driver is now missing and I am unable to go online (I am using another PC running XP to write this note). PS: If necessary, I can have access to another&nbsp;PC running Vista Business.</p>
<p>How do I go about restoring this missing driver? Thank you</p>

            I called Microsoft (paid) Tech Support. It turns out that this "Teredo Pseudo Tunneling (something)" Network adapter is not needed.&nbsp; I plugged the RJ45 into a different port on my router and restarted the PC.&nbsp;I am now getting connectivity i.e access to
 the internet. I checked Device Manager. There is no longer a "Teredo Pseudo Tunneling (something)" Network adapter listed under "Network Adapters" in Device Manager and I no longer get a Device Manager-related error message.&nbsp; Case closed.

</p><blockquote>have to touch the side button to get screen back on.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>"side button" is ambiguous.&nbsp; E.g. for one thing it depends on the orientation of the device.&nbsp; In my case, with the Surface in Portrait orientation my "side button" would be its Power button; then tapping it would be putting the screen to Sleep but it could
 also be used to cause Hibernation.&nbsp; Other possibilities for the Power button would depend on the machine's Power Options.&nbsp; Another "side button" is the Volume rocker.&nbsp; The only conceivable use for it in this scenario would be in conjunction with the Logo button
 (or the Power button) but I suppose in a way the Logo button might be called a "side button" too.&nbsp; Pressing the Logo button could have the effect of waking a machine from Sleep; so maybe your symptom is just that the machine is going to Sleep unexpectedly?&nbsp;
 BTW something that you could do with both the Logo button and the Volume Up rocker together would be to start Narrator; maybe it could explain what was happening for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When you install Windows 10 on a clean formatted disk, it first creates a partition on the disk at the start of the hard disk. This partition is called the System Reserved Partition. Next it use the balance unallocated disk space to create your system drive
 and install the operating system. To see the System Reserved Partition, you will have to open Disk Management.</li><li>To remove "System Reserved partition" it would be easy to just leave it be. Windows hides it by default instead of creating a drive letter for it. Most people will never notice they have a System Reserved partition, and Windows will only show it to you
 when you use disk-partitioning software. This partition is mandatory if you use BitLocker or want to use BitLocker in the future. Every drive is made ready for BitLocker while installing Windows.<br />
</li></ol>

</p><p>Let us know so that we can further help.</p>

            Hi SLein123
<br />
<br />Version 1903 (build 18282 ) has not been released to the general public yet, it is still being beta tested by the Insider ring. That version is due for release in 3 - 4 weeks to the general public . . .
<br />
<br />Keep a watch on this page and when that Feature Update is released, you will be able to install it from there immediately, rather than waiting for it to get around to your PC . . .

<p><span>At the moment only way to get it is to join Insider Preview program and set PC to get those previews. All previews are beta versions and can cause all kind of issues (computer crash, data loss...). So I recommend you
 to wait until v1903 is released.</span></p>

<p>- apply my user account cursor to the overall machine. I am admin on my computer, and I user left handed cursor. I'd like them to be applied everywhere, including when starting the computer and facing the logon screen. is it possible ? how ?</p>
<p>- same kind of question, I use a Razer mouse, using a specific profile on Razer Synapse software (swaping left &amp; right button and other stuff). I'd like this program to be launched at logon, even if no user are logged yet, is it possible in some way ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>1/ homemade computer, very recent, from march 2016 with gigabyte zx170, i7 6700k, etc.</p>
<p>2/ I have no black screen issue, i just said that from google search, trying to look for windows logon screen" only brings black screen issue. It's not MY issue. It's just the usual links on google. So I am posting here to find an answer to my question which
 has nothing to do with black screen. I need to know if we can customize cursors and programs launched at windows lock screen/logon screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the left handed mouse, i don't need that kind of help, I perfectly know how to switch my buttons once logged. My question is for logon screen, before being logged in Windows.</p>
<p>This Screen to be precised:</p>
<p>http://www.winbeta.org/sites/default/files/news/CIyA9GeW8AEFFOP.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to have left handed button on that screen (or my razer synapse startup programm launched at that screen) + I need to change the cursor there. Is it possible ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks !!!</p>

            <p>To my recollection, cursors are loaded from your user theme.&nbsp; If you wanted to update this for the base system, I believe you'd need to update the base system theme (Windows theme).&nbsp; I think that's the only way to do this.</p>

            <p>There's no easy way to hack the base system theme, and since hacking it badly would result in very bad things I'm not comfortable advising you on this.&nbsp; If you're super excited about this, you can look up how to do it, but again this is power user stuff
 that would be bad to do wrong.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your fix-manual. I do this two times, the problem ist not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found another thing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If something from the "Tablet" UI is open, there are NO freezes in batterie mode!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example</p>
<p>- if I open the clock or also the Start-Menue, there are NO&nbsp; freezes. I can move the mouse as long as I want. BUT
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- if I close the clock or the Start-Menue, that means I'am on the "Desktop", freezes are back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your issue resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue with my new Surface pro 4 i7 256gb 8gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-installed Windows, though I even was on a clean install, didn't help.</p>
<p>I downloaded the official image on the website of Microsoft and installed it and this didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I joined the insider program (slow) and installed the 14393.5 version and the issue is still there but still the issue is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything with no extra apps or programs installed and the problem only was there while on battery power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked for errors which aren't there of course and I ran PCmark and the scores where normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'm gonna send my Surface pro 4 back to the retailer :(&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>A Rollback to a old system restore point fix the problem only till&nbsp;I install the newest windows updates!</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated for a few days to the newest Windows 10 (An.Update), this didnt fix the Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I received <strong>yesterday the Firmware Update and after that Update its looks like the Problem is fixed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can unplug the power cable and can work interruptless. That is great. But also thats what I expected from such an device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an link to read what the firmware update fixed at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the best, that my device is now stable but also in the future. Due I had this problem after I buyed the SF4Pro and after a few months any of the updates fixed the problem it worked a few months and then the problem was again there. After rollback
 to an older restore point, as Workaround, I fixed the problem but after the next updates the problem was back...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well...<strong>.all is good now.</strong> But for true Iam scared that every time after a update in future the problem will come back... :/ this will for shure in my mind if the sf5pro will be released. Its bad for microsoft and also for me as customer wo
 REALY love the surface devices.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I still have the issue, though strange enough the freezes are less frequent and shorter. It happens in particular when I do a reboot. After the reboot the freezes come back. After putting the Surface in to sleep and/or disconnect and connect
 the surface keyboard, the freezes disappear after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I installed the latest updates and since the last time i responded here, I did not install any programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>After plugging in my Logitech Unify USB receiver, the problem disappears immediately while using the Microsoft type cover and on battery power.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you updated the firmware available for your Surface keyboard? Is this a Type or Touch Cover? Did the issue gets resolved after you plugged in your USB receiver
 device?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>for your motherboard. However someone with a similar audio device on a different Asus motherboard had some success with the Vista drivers. See:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-hardware/adi-ad1986a-soundmax-driver-support/0babcb31-3ac2-4e85-b9c2-3093f2439ce3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-hardware/adi-ad1986a-soundmax-driver-support/0babcb31-3ac2-4e85-b9c2-3093f2439ce3</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Since you are messing around with possibly incompatible drivers, I would create a System Restore point and have your data backed up before you start.</p>
<p>A Windows 7 compatible PCI or USB sound device would be a solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At random times my computer will BSOD for no apparent reason and I receive this error message in event viewer:</p>

</p>
<p>Session "Microsoft Security Client OOBE" stopped due to the following error: 0xC000000D</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have deleted MS Security Client in hopes of stopping this problem but it did not help. I read online to delete a file named "eppoobe.etl". This file would be created every time the computer would crash.</p>
<p>How do I stop my computer from BSODing and completely remove MS Security Client.</p>
<p>Each time it BSOD it says "Memory_Mangement". I am running Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>

<div><br />
<div>According to the dump file dates I have had this problem since March 12, 2013 but I suspect it was earlier than that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you posted your reply my computer again got a BSOD. I uploaded the last 5 dump files to skydrive:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=815CB531F49755AE!164</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do not have the file MSSEOOBE.etl but I do have a file called EppOobe.etl and I deleted this file. I will preform a clean boot and I await your response.</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I read that SSDs do not need a defrag so I did not do it. However I ran the memory diagnostic and it said there were hardware problems and I should contact my computer manufacturer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I&nbsp;decided &nbsp;to take one of my RAM sticks out (I have 2 x 4 GB sticks) and I will see how my computer works with just the one RAM lane in use. If there is a problem I will swap sticks and maybe a lane.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will be monitoring my computer to make sure random BSODs do not occur.&nbsp;</div>

These were all related to memory management probably caused by your Avast.&nbsp; I would remove and replace with MSE<br />

            I deleted MSE in the first place because it was crashing my computer and these crashes happened way before Avast was even installed.&nbsp;

<div>I uploaded some dumps before Avast was installed (Avast was installed on April 12)</div>

            Your call of course<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><strong>These crashes were caused by memory corruption (probably a driver).&nbsp; Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem. &nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<p><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*Dont forget to upload any further DMP files (especially those when verifier is running)</span></em><br />
<br />
*If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />
In other words STOP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you dont know what this means you probably arent<br />
<br />
<strong>1-Memtest.</strong><br />
*Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. http://www.memtest.org&nbsp;<br />
*Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
*Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
*Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.<br />
If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
2-Driver verifier</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is.</span></em><br />
<br />
*But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.<br />
*Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
*I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
*Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<strong><br />
Here is the procedure:</strong><br />
- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
*Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Finish" on the next page.<br />
*Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.<br />
*Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least
 36 hours of continuous operation.<br />
*If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
*If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />

            So I figured out what the problem was. Turns out one of my memory sticks is bad. I used one for around 2 weeks and had no crashes. Today I swapped the other one and my computer crashed twice today

            Hi Zigzag,
<div><br />
<div>I was googling solutions for my problem and I happened to stumble upon this thread.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm having similar issues with Session "Microsoft Security Client OOBE" stopped due to the following error: 0xC000000D. My computer screen freezes and I'm forced to do a hard restart. I go into event viewer and this is the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've done the basic trouble shooting such as deleting EppOobe.etl to no avail. I'm currently on win7 64 pro. I have tested my memory and that doesn't seem to be the issue. Some people suggested to disable Microsoft Antimalware Service in services.msc but
 when I go to disable it...the program is greyed out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=EFFBDEC6F12776C0!132&amp;authkey=!AM01UAHrrlstoAA</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you offer me any advice? Thank you so much</div>

<h2>            No internet connection even after full re-install of windows 10</h2>
                    I lossed internet connect and when troubleshooted said "the remote device or resource won't accept the connection". I have gone through multiple forums and turned off proxy, reset internet explorer and went through with multiple maleware programs to detect
 and get rid of any maleware. It did not work so i did i full re-install of windows 10 but i still get the same message on the wi-fi. I dont get this on any other devices on the wi-fi connection.

<p>Naresh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. As far as I know all updates are in.&nbsp; (Usually, an update is in process without notifying me and the PC closes out).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Just recently tried to use Dropbox.&nbsp; But, there are other processes when I try to email and Windows goes to Edge mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not use Edge!&nbsp; I do not use Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use Firefox for my Yahoo accounts.&nbsp; Our local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e Newspaper goes to Outlook when
 I try to mail an article.</p>
<p>3. Yes, I was using the Dropbox app.&nbsp; Entered name/email to add for sharing folder and received message Windows could not find them. Therefore, could not share files.&nbsp; Recipients did not receive an invitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that there are links in Windows 10 that use edge and outlook even though I turned them off 1-2 years ago when I upgraded to 10.&nbsp; Perhaps, recent upgrades changed settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need is a means of going to my Firefox/Yahoo accounts automatically instead of Edge/Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Received replacement controller today via Microsoft Support, still - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redrun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Received replacement controller today via Microsoft Support, still loses signal wired&#47;wireless.</h2>
                    
<p>I waited a little over 2 weeks for my defective while under warranty controller's replacement. I had issues of the controller, at first I though was a drifting problem. Each day it got worst and worst. While playing any game, the controller would disconnect
 regardless it having fresh batteries or wired into the console via USB. So I contacted customer support and the put an order for my replacement, granted I send in the defective and only controller I own that was giving issues.</p>
<p>After waiting 2 weeks, I received the replacement in the mail. So I made sure my Xbox was updated if needed and rebooted to be sure. I put in the pair of new batteries provided by Customer Support in the what looks new controller they sent me. Plugged in
 the controller and paired it to the console via USB and updated the firmware. After the update, I rebooted the Xbox and turned back on the controller after the reboot.</p>
<p>I kept it wired to the console and booted up a few games. Within 15 minutes of gameplay, I notice a little sluggishness in the controller what would happen for a second or two. So I switched games, booted up Halo and within 5 minutes in the campaign the
 controller froze, the character kept running forward into the wall for about 5-10 seconds then I got control again. At this point I disconnected the USB and let it run wireless to be sure the issue wasn't the USB. Within 2 minutes, the controller would lose
 its signal and I would get a notification to reconnect my controller in game.</p>
<p>Keep in mind there is nothing obstructing (no microwave, no glass cabinet, or no wireless router) the console connection. My setup is similar to what you find in a desktop PC setup (monitor, wired network, controller plugged in via USB with adapter and headset).</p>

<p>I have a pretty strong feeling from what you describe that your issue seems related to the wifi card on the console. &nbsp;But lets check on a few things...</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>-Will your console work wireless without interruptions? </p>

<p>FYI: here is the website for repairs on the console if you choose that direction but it takes about 30 days unless you allow them to hold an amount on a credit card until they fix the xbox and return it.</p>

<p>@NewBlacksmurf, signal to controller via USB/mirco USB will still get interrupted/dropped/locked for several seconds while playing any game (even that Deer God @200+MB on HDD).</p>
<p>Running wireless would get the same results, but instead would get a signal loss. The controller Xbox Button would blink and or dim.</p>

<p>Update: I have a Seagate 2.5 internal 1TB Solid State Hybrid Drive I have be using installed inside a "Creative Minds Xbox Media Hub", which looks great attached to the XB1 and functions as an USB hub as well as it does as a fast reliable data storage extension.
 I haven't noticed any problems for a good whole month when I had it attached to the XB1. After a month of I noticed a problems which were symptoms of the Original Post (controller issues).</p>
<p>I was about to pack up my console to send it back for an exchange, before doing so I removed the external storage unite (CMXMH w/ 1TB SSHD) and restore factory settings.
</p>
<p>I logged back in the console, DL the latest update and DL a few games. After several hours, no signs of previous issues.
</p>
<p>I'm thinking I may need to reinstall the Media Hub w/ SSHD and w/o the SSHD in order to conclude if the issues are a result of the 3rd party device and or the storage solution.</p>

            It seems best to just put anything you don't want to see in Photos in a folder that's not included in its Sources (see Settings).
