    <title>Different language versions of Fable 2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Different language versions of Fable 2 </h2>
                    <p>Greetings, friends. Now I am actively investigating the localization of the Fable 2.<br />The point is that there were at least 3 versions in the game. One is available to us in the store, the second is a separate version with the Russian language, the third one with the German one. First I bought a version from the store. There was no Russian language. I bought a CD with GOTY edition, Russian version.&nbsp;</p><p>The game was established from the cloud, but it was determined as a German version.<br />Those. the drive confirmed the license, but the wrong version downloaded from the cloud.</p>

<p>With the region and the language there are no problems, everything is exactly. The disc works perfectly in the right language for 360.</p>

<p>Paradox, friends.</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>A few W10 OS bugs&#58; Unresponsive system tray, input on emulators, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas m bridges  say:</h3>
<h2>            A few W10 OS bugs&#58; Unresponsive system tray, input on emulators, and Wifi adapter</h2>
                    <p><span>Microsoft has done a great job improving the usability and graphical interface for Windows 10. I really enjoy using this new operating system. Programs run
 well and nothing takes too long to load. Windows 10 is mostly error free; however there are some bugs that come up from time to time. I sent this message in case you were not aware of these bugs. I will briefly summarize them, and then provide computer specs
 and more detailed descriptions of each issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first bug appears to occur at random. Everything in the system tray becomes unresponsive including: calendar, notification, battery, wifi, and sound.
 The second bug is related to emulators and key inputs getting "stuck". The third bug is a temporary error with the wifi adapter causing there to be no internet access. If these bugs are fixed, I would be more likely to recommend the operating system to others.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>System Specifications:</span></p>
<p><span>Brand: ASUS Ultrabook S405C</span></p>
<p><span>CPU: Intel Core i5-3317U CPU @ 1.70GHz</span></p>
<p><span>RAM: 6.00 GB</span></p>
<p><span>GFX: Intel HD Graphics 4000</span></p>
<p><span>OS: Windows 10 Home</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unresponsive System Tray:</span></p>
<p><span>All icons in the system tray become unresponsive. Sound stops playing and the start menu will not open, as well as the calendar. Left clicking on any of
 the icons will have no effect; however, right clicking on the icons will bring up the correct options for that icon. This issue does not seem to occur for any particular reason. Once the tray becomes unresponsive, it will stay that way until the system is
 restarted. Sometimes the issue won’t occur for several days. Sometimes it will happen more than once in a day. It happens very randomly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>"Stuck" emulator input:</p>
<p>While using emulators (for video games) occasionally a key input will get "stuck". The emulator will think the key is being continuously pushed, even if it isn't. Hitting several keys in succession (a little mashing) will "unstick"
 the key. I have noticed this issue across multiple emulators. The issue didn't come up until updating to Windows 10. &nbsp;The input issue is only within the emulator, nowhere else. Another interesting note, the issue still occurs when I emulate keyboard inputs
 into the emulator from a Bluetooth connected Wiimote. I use PIEfree to emulate the keyboard inputs. Again, the "stuck" key isn't stuck outside the game emulator, only in the game. It has always been the directional keys that get "stuck".. the one's I use most
 often.<br />
</p>
<p><span>No Internet Access:</span></p>
<p><span>The computer will be connected to the router and when it comes out of sleep mode, occasionally there will be no internet access. The computer will be connected
 to router, however the wifi icon will state that there is a limited connecting and a yellow exclamation mark will be on the wifi icon. Other devices connected to the same router will work just fine. Clicking on the wifi icon and turning the wifi off and back
 on again will solve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 has been a great operating system and even better than Windows 8. I look forward to the updates and improvements you guys release in the future. Thank
 you for taking the time to resolve these bugs and listening to customer feedback. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please email me at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span>Thomas Bridges</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Run an automatic repair using the Windows 8.1 installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps to perform automatic repair: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Boot the computer using the Windows 8 bootable DVD.</span></p>

<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on ‘<strong>Troubleshoot’</strong> then click on ‘<strong>Advanced Option’</strong> and then click on ‘<strong>Automatic Repair’</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Boot from the Windows 8.1 installation media&nbsp;and then perform system restore and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

<h2>            Computer crashes randomly</h2>
                    I'm sorry if this is the wrong place, it's my first time posting here. <br />
<br />
A while back my computer started restarting randomly. I wouldn't get a blue screen or anything, it would just restart with no warning. It'd say that it recovered from an error, but I have no clue what is causing it, as it happens completely randomly and doesn't
 seem to happen when I do something specific (and I'm not a tech expert to search deeper into it). At first I thought it happened when I'd do a scan, but apparently that wasn't the case as it continued to happen when I didn't scan the computer anyway. I've
 completed scans though and my computer appears to be clean. I thought I had somehow beaten the problem because it doesn't happen in each session, but evidently not.
<br />
It just happened again a few minutes ago so I decided to post here, as I know that these errors can't be doing much good for the survivability of my pc. Here is the error it told me it recovered from this time:<br />
<br />
Problem signature:<br />
&nbsp; Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BlueScreen<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7601.2.1.0.768.3<br />
&nbsp; Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1032<br />
<br />
Additional information about the problem:<br />
&nbsp; BCCode:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 116<br />
&nbsp; BCP1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FFFFFA80067D2010<br />
&nbsp; BCP2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FFFFF88007DA36AC<br />
&nbsp; BCP3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FFFFFFFFC000009A<br />
&nbsp; BCP4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000000000000004<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6_1_7601<br />
&nbsp; Service Pack:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1_0<br />
&nbsp; Product:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 768_1<br />
<br />
It also gives me the location of two files 'that help describe the problem', but one of them is not there when I search and the other is a dmp file that I don't know how to open.<br />
<br />
I've tried to run maintenance checks, but it doesn't find any problems at all. However I went to the event viewer and it shows 8 events (from around the time of the crash). 6 errors, one warning, and one critical. I don't know which one could have caused the
 crash or if they're irrelevant. One error says that the computer has rebooted from a bugcheck (and shows a few codes). I don't know if it's relevant. I'd appreciate any help you can give me. I always install the available windows updates if that helps any.
 Thanks in advance.<br />

            My minidump folder only had one file, which I copied to the desktop. I'm guessing dmp files are deleted after some time so that's why I don't have more from the previous crashes?
<br />
I didn't know what overclocking was until now so I'm guessing I'm not doing that (could it happen accidentally?).<br />
<br />
I uploaded the dmp file and system info file to rapid share, here is the link: http://rapidshare.com/files/3547401625/dmpfile%26systeminfokaterinafm.rar (I'm sorry if I made a mistake here, as I haven't used zip for my own files before).<br />
<br />
I know you said you need two dmp files, so if you can't help me without the second one, should I do this again the next time my computer crashes? I've changed the settings like you said. What does turning automatic restart off has done exactly, and what does
 reducing the dmp file size do?<br />
<br />
I don't know how to start safe mode exactly. Do I restart the computer and press F8 as it starts?
<br />
I had booted up the computer in safe mode (without networking) after one of the crashes and did a scan, and a crash didn't occur (eventually I gave up and restarted the computer normally). The crashes don't happen every time I turn on the computer (even in
 long sessions), so I can't be sure the same problem will occur while in safe mode. The next crash could be a few days off. What should I do after I'm in safe mode?
<br />
I'm sorry if those are silly questions :/. Thank you for replying so quickly.<br />

            Please ignore the previous link I gave you. I (after searching for blue screen solutions) managed to get a second dmp file, though I don't know how relevant it is (it says it is connected to a hardware error). So please download the new link, which includes
 the old and new dmp files (and also has a couple of xml files that came with it, so I added those in also just in case). Thank you.

"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the Blue Screen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".</b><br />
<br />
<i>Since Vista, the "Timeout Detection and Recovery" (TDR) components of the OS video subsystem have been capable of doing some truly impressive things to try to recover from issues which would have caused earlier OS's like XP to crash.</i><br />
<br />
<i>As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.</i><br />
<br />
<i>If playing with video driver versions hasn't helped, make sure the box is not overheating.<br />
&nbsp;Try removing a side panel and aiming a big mains fan straight at the motherboard and GPU.<br />

            So based on the files I sent you, the problem appears to be either over-heating or dust (did both dmp files report the same problem?)? Is this caused by the fan not working properly anymore, or because of aging hardware?<br />
<br />
I downloaded cpu-z and gpu-z, but I don't know how I'm supposed to tell when something is not working correctly.

It can be heat, overclocking, power, the video card itself, etc.<br />
<br />
If it is a laptop chances are it is heat.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
CPU-z and GPU-z will tell you what the temps are (should be doing whatever makes it crash) and you should put those temps in your next post.<br />

            I am currently in safe mode with networking because the computer froze while I went to load CPU-Z. I had to manually restart, which I'm guessing is because of that change in the settings you told me to do earlier? Also I'm not using a laptop.<br />
I opened CPU-Z again now and it told me of an error while trying to launch (error code 0x43C (1084), here is the log (irrelevant if it's because of the safe mode):

            I seemed to have had the same problem again, with the difference this time that my screen seemed to stop being able to detect being connected to the computer. I plugged it off and back on again, and it's working now, but when I opened the computer it told
 me it recovered from a blue screen error again. I have both error log files that came along and I uploaded them here: http://rapidshare.com/files/4152945027/dmpfile2.rar . Can anyone tell what seems to be causing all this?<br />

sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.<br />

<p>Although the Bug Check 0xFE: BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER does usually indicate hardware it could easily<br />
be a USB device attached and not System USB hardware. And you can never really rule out drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: FE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000FE&nbsp; &lt;-- read this link<br />

<br />
<strong>Is this a Upgrade installation of Windows 7 or did Windows 7 come on the system from the factory?</strong></p>
<p>A possible cause could be Windows Updates, especially drivers. Even drivers not usually thought of as<br />
USB related, such as video/display, network (NIC &amp; WiFI), and others, can be the cause.</p>
<p>Norton especially, McAfee, Kaspersky, SpyBot,&nbsp;Adaware and <strong>others</strong> could be causing or have a role<br />
in this issue. Try uninstalling them to see if that helps. Use their maker's Removal Tools and/or<br />
special instructions. (Antivirus/antispyware/security programs.)<br />
<br />
----------------------</p>
<p>Remove <strong>ALL </strong>USB devices from the computer. Be sure to check for updated drivers for ALL USB<br />
devices. <br />

    <title>Ori and the Blind Forest Mt. Horu Purple Gate Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandonjf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ori and the Blind Forest Mt. Horu Purple Gate Bug</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a known timeframe as to when the Mr. Horu purple gate bug is going to be patched (if it's going to be patched)?&nbsp; The game was amazing right up to the point where I was almost at the end and couldn't proceed because a gate would not open.&nbsp; This is
 the purple gate leading to the bottom-most portion of the Mt. Horu map.&nbsp; It should open once a group of enemies are killed, but it seems like one will not respawn if the player is killed after saving with that enemy defeated prior to the gate opening (I'm
 guessing that is the cause).&nbsp; I've read others having the same issue, but wasn't sure if this is something that will be fixed or if the only remedy is to start over.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Explorer shows folder as empty but folder Properties shows it is not empty</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I'm trying to delete empty folders from my computer. I'm running Windows 7 Professional and my user account is an administrator and the only user account on the computer.</p>
<p>When I use Windows Exlporer to navigate to the folder it appears empty: "This folder is empty". But if I navigate back to the parent and right-click on the sub-folder and select Properties it shows: "Contains: 1 file,&nbsp;0 folders" or&nbsp;for some folders: "Contains:
 2 files, 0 folders". Same when I run DIR on the folder from CMD.</p>
<p>I have hidden files and folders checked&nbsp;to display and I have checked that I am the owner of the folder.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A step closer. I found another option in Windows Explorer: "Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)". Just in case you need help finding this option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Explorer </li><li>If the menu options (File, Edit, View, Tools, Help) don't show, click ALT </li><li>Click Tools </li><li>Select Folder options... </li><li>Click on the View tab </li><li>Uncheck: Hide protected operating system files (Recommended) </li></ol>
<p>You can now see and search for hidden, protected operating system files such as Thumbs.db.</p>
<p>I'm using Fast Empty Folder Finder from <a href="http://listeningpc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://listeningpc.com</a> to find and delete empty folders.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>

It seems like to be all OK, but without SD-CARD, phone is UNUSEABLE . !!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DO NOT KNOW, if <strong>Scanning was succesfull</strong>, NO MESSAGE APPEARS....<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.utteraccess.com%2fforum%2fstyle_emoticons%2fdefault%2ficonfused.gif" /></p>
<p>SD.CARD.FOLDER= NO MORE&nbsp; EMPTY..........seems to be possible OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why i do not see <strong>Scanning REPORT ?</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.utteraccess.com%2fforum%2fstyle_emoticons%2fdefault%2ficonfused.gif" /></p>

<p>3.Why APPEARS this Message only before:&nbsp; EnterSIM PIN, then PIN...while phone is LOCKED
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.utteraccess.com%2fforum%2fstyle_emoticons%2fdefault%2ficonfused.gif" /></p>
<p>Why not <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>AFTER</strong></span> EnterSIM PIN, then PIN-OK

    <title>Windows 10 Customer Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taslantic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Customer Service</h2>
                    <p>At this point I am at a loss. &nbsp;I honestly don't know what to do. &nbsp;I am going to just copy the basics of my situation and hopefully someone will know how to help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL:DR - I have spent over 24 hours on the phone with Level 1 and Level 2 trying to get Windows 10 installed. &nbsp;If that were the only issue, I would understand. &nbsp;In the process of them "helping me" they have cause my Windows 7 to not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a summarized (believe it or not) version of my story...</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Today is 8/23/2015 and I have been trying to install Windows 10 on my machine since it came out (7/29/2015).&nbsp; The first day it released I called their "Level 1" Customer Service and they logged in to my computer to try and see what the issue was.&nbsp; After 8 hours
 on the phone with them, yes 8 hours...my computer started to "blue screen of death" randomly as they were changing things.&nbsp; Since the first day I have spent over 24 hours on the phone with Microsoft trying to get it fixed.&nbsp; I have been escalated to "level
 2" and had a grand total of about 6 different agents logged in to my computer.&nbsp; During this process we have had to do a fresh install of Windows 7 and we have tried to install Windows 10 over a dozen times.&nbsp; The best part, Windows 7 worked perfectly fine on
 my computer before they started "helping".&nbsp; Now I can't even get Windows 7 to install updates.&nbsp; I have never had these issues in the past.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
My last interaction with their help desk involved an individual calling me back (finally) and basically asking me to start over with my explanation.&nbsp; He hadn't taken the time to read the last 3 weeks of notes on the account.&nbsp; I immediately asked to speak to
 his supervisor.&nbsp; He and his supervisor tried to explain to me that it was a "hardware" issue.&nbsp; I simple explained that my computer had zero issues before they had logged in to it.&nbsp; They first tried to tell me that my motherboard did not have Windows 10 drivers
 available yet, so before I allowed them to log in to my computer I went to my motherboard's website (Gigabyte) and had the driver download page on my screen.&nbsp; As soon as he was able to see my screen I showed him that Windows 10 drivers were released over 1
 month before Windows 10 was released.&nbsp; He then claimed it was my harddrive.&nbsp; I knew at this point they were grasping at straws. I knew it was not hardware, so I asked them..."Is it possible for y'all to damage my hardware while logged in?" &nbsp;Again, I knew the
 answer, and I was given a canned response, "Sir I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we are unable to damage your hardware while logged in to your computer." &nbsp;I agreed, and explained, it can't be hardware then...because the issues didn't
 exist before their "help".&nbsp; The supervisor asked me if I have give them 24 hours to resolve the issue and they would call me back tomorrow (8/21/2015).&nbsp; Well here we are 8/23/2015 and I never received a call.&nbsp; I explained to him that, yes, you could call tomorrow,
 but I had better receive a call because it was my sister-in-laws birthday dinner and I would have to leave early to be available from 9 pm - 12 pm.&nbsp; So not only did I rush home from dinner, I sat there for 3 hours and never got the call.&nbsp; I have never experienced
 such terrible customer service in my entire life. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
The easy excuse would be, "they are outsourced so it's a language barrier".&nbsp; That might play a small part, but the kicker is, I am an international trainer for a mortgage company.&nbsp; I regularly travel to places in India and the Philippines to train agents, so
 I know better customer service is possible.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
At this point I have had agents lie to me about call backs, try and trick me into believing it's a hardware issue, and generally just messed up my computer.&nbsp; I am at a loss for words.&nbsp; Microsoft, a company that has been around for decades, has still not figured
 out how to support their customers?</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
This has been the worst experience Customer Service experience of my life.&nbsp; I guess the silver lining is I now have a really good example of what NOT to do when I am training agents next new hire class.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I just realized that I am having a hard time submitting this review because I am stuck using Internet Explorer 8...thank you Microsoft.</div>

<p>
</p><p>After you have Windows 7 back up and running make an Image Backup before you attempt to upgrade to 10 again (since the upgrade is free for a year starting July 29th, 2015 wait until January or February of 2016 before trying to upgrade again. Hopefully by
 this time there will be no hardware issues).</p>

            <p>So I have managed to get Windows 7 reinstalled. &nbsp;The problem is, when installing updates it crashes occasionally now...it never used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I type this I am installing all of the "optional" updates because I managed to get all of the actual updates installed. &nbsp;At this point I don't need to back up my information...we did a clean install...I have nothing on the harddrive that has Windows installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I am trying to get Windows 10 installed...and waiting for a promised resolution from the Level 2 Supervisor I spoke with on Thursday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for Windows 10 issues? &nbsp;or what to do about what they say is a hardware issue? &nbsp;Is there a way for me to check and see if there is something wrong with my harddrive? &nbsp;Is it possibly something they changed? &nbsp;(I know this might not be a hardware
 issue, but a piece of software conflicting with my hardware)</p>

            <p>Suggest you run a series of test to see if your hardware is stable. I've <strong>
bolded</strong> the more important one to install and run.</p>

<span>
</span></p><p><strong>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:</strong></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Note: If you are Overclocking or use any automatic overclocking or power saving BIOS features, start out by disabling them: Intel EIST, Turbo Mode, Cool and Quite and drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Disconnect any other (additional) internal hard drives and external USB devices.</p>
<p>Check for any loose hard drive power or SATA cables, Graphics card or other power cables.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>First run Memtest86+: </strong></p>
<p>This runs from a boot disk / CD or USB and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory</p>
<p>sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.</p>
<p>Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.</p>

<p><strong>Hard drive Testing:</strong></p>
<p>1) If you don't know your drives make / model number AND your computer is no longer able to load Windows:</p>
<p>a) Remove the drive from your desktop and check the label for the make and model number.</p>
<p>b) Remove the bottom cover of your laptop, remove the drive and check the label for the make and model number.</p>
<p>2) If Windows is still usable, install "Speccy",it provides System/computer Information in detail about your:</p>
<p>OS, CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Graphics, Hard Drive, Optical Drive, Audio, Peripherals, Network.</p>
<p>Note: RAM option will show number of slots, DRAM Timing,</p>

            <p>Yes it could cause all kind of problems when the area of memory occupied by that bad stick was accessed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was it a 2 or 4GB stick?&nbsp; If it was a 2GB stick that is bad I would remove the other 2GB stick as your motherboard will maximize performance with a balanced memory configuration.</p>

<h2>            After Windows 10 update, bluetooth keyboard is constantly forgotten and needing to be re-paired</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 (Build 10586.11 if it matters) and ever since then am having problems with my bluetooth keyboard, which after restart, logout, or sleep or just being idle for some time doesn't work needs to be re-paired, even though it saysit's connected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to update the Bluetooth Keyboard Driver and choosing the option to search the internet for a driver, it says the best software for my keyboard is already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Device Manager, Properties, Events: this is what the it says under Device Installed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Management concluded the process to install driver bth.inf_amd64_fe3405edecd7504e\bth.inf for Device Instance ID BTHENUM\DEV_0C48223002EF\8&amp;C185E19&amp;0&amp;BLUETOOTHDEVICE_0C48223002EF with the following status: 0x0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If somebody could help here I would hugely appreciate it. This has been, and continues to be a huge time suck and annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p />

<h2>            how do I know which partition to install onto&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to switch from W7-64bit OS to W7-32bit because of incompatible peripherals. I have the correct installation disk but I do not know how to answer the questions about where to install windows. There are aparently 3 partitions on my C: drive,
 one is very small 39MB,&nbsp;&nbsp;type OEM (reserved), the second is&nbsp;RECOVERY 14.6GB and the third is OS (the rest of the hard drive) . Do I need to format anything? Which partition am I supposed to select? The help system does not provide the answers. Don't have time
 for multiple&nbsp;trial and error decisions, need to do this OS system change within the next few hours.

<p>My first question would be, did you file a complaint on him, or a review? If it was just a review, his rep likely fell to a level where his communications abilities are limited. In this case, he just needs to raise his rep by playing fair and keeping things
 clean, or by getting positive reviews. If you filed a complaint on him, and he did receive a comm ban, he will have to wait until the ban is lifted. The thing in this case is, if you filed an untrue complaint, it was not you that caused the ban. All complaints
 are investigated, and if the complaint is found to be false, no action would have been taken.

            <p>It's not necessary to mark it read-only, because only an administrator is capable of modifying it anyway. So unless you intentionally click "Allow" on one of these popups, you'll never have to worry about the hosts file being changed without your knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.davescomputertips.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f11%2fwindows-8.1-user-account-control-400x209.png" height="209" width="400" /><br />
<em>Only programs ran after this warning can change your HOSTS file.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And besides, any program capable of changing the file could just as easily remove the read-only flag, make the change, then put it back to read-only.&nbsp; The read-only flag offers no actual protection or security, so heed those UAC warnings wisely.</p>

            I tried every possible solution per the link you provided but none worked. This is happening with each and every Excel spreadsheet I receive through email, no matter who sent it to me, and it started happening immediately after the Windows 10 install.
 I do not believe that the files are actually corrupted. I need a resolution to this issue: I use this product in my work as an accountant, and I receive a lot of spreadsheets via email. Thank you.

            <p>I was having the same issues, my previously save worksheets opened, however any new which were sent or ones I needed to access (pre Windows 10&nbsp;via Dropbox) would not 'corrupt' message.&nbsp; Since this did not work for me either, I did more research, found this
 older fix, tried it and it worked (I currently have Excel 2013, however this fix did it for me.&nbsp; Good luck!!</p>

<h2>            Skype Freezing During Calls</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have begun encountering an issue with my Skype about a month ago, as it is freezing during calls and video chats. The video stream image will freeze, but the application will still be running fine. About 10 seconds after this, my whole computer freezes.
 This has happened on every call thus far, and I have been pulling my hair out trying to get it fixed. Any help is greatly appreciated. I am on an ASUS ux305ca with Windows 10 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>I have the same problem - sometimes the laptop (ux305ca) randomly freezes, not solely when using skype. Mega frustrating - I should probably send it to asus support for a check up (maybe hardware related). Updating drivers does not do the trick. Since the
 laptop is fanless, my guess it is heating related...though I have no real idea. Any help would be appreciated.

            I've been on the phone with Canon and have confirmed I have the latest version of software. I can initiate scanning from my laptop but not from the printer as I was previously able to do. Would like to eventually know why things changed, but not a critical
 issue.

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. Please confirm if the issue occurs on both the Windows Scanner as well as the Canon utility. If you are able to scan from the Windows Fax and Scan utility, then you might have to uninstall and reinstall the Canon Printer and
 scanner utility or software. To access Windows Scanner, in the search bar on the taskbar, type "Scan" and choose Windows Fax and Scan.</p>
