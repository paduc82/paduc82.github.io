    <title>applications disappeared in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            applications disappeared in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I was on Windows 8 and upgraded to Windows 10. Everything was fine. I have not used my PC for the different applications I have such as Microsoft Office or various programs of Autodesk.</p>
<p>I didn't realize but when recently I was about to open a file, I could not find the appropriate application whether it was .DOCX or .DWG.</p>
<p>I then realized that my applications disappeared as if they were never in my PC.</p>
<p>I downloaded a freeware to see whether the files and folders were deleted. It found them there but not necessarily in a "good" shape to be recovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the recovery system to an earlier date. Same disappointing result: it failed.</p>
<p>I tried to re-install the programs which disappeared, the answer is that I have to uninstall the previous program (which I cannot do anyway).</p>
<p>I AM STUCK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>should I go back to Windows 8.1 and re-install my programs ?</p>
<p>Would I be able to re-instate Windows 10 after that ? (free upgrade) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any answer will certainly help. Thanks a lot</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
We would like to ask you some questions for us to better provide you the best possible resolution. Please do answer the following questions below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us the application that you cannot access or use after the upgrade?</li><li>Is there any chance that there are some applications that are still working? If yes, may we know what are those applications as well?</li><li>How did you re-install the applications? Have you tried downloading it through the Microsoft Store?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you are planning on going back to Windows 8.1 and wants to re-install Window 10, you still can, since your computer has a digital license on it from the time you have upgraded to Windows 10 and activated it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Hi jarius Tol,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although things have changed from the day I sent you the questions, I am going to try to answer to your questions.</p>
<p>Those which disappeared were AutoCAD, Microsoft Office mainly.</p>
<p>What is interesting perhaps to you would be to know that when I tried to re-install them, it wouldn't let me arguing that they are already installed.</p>
<p>When going to applications manager (they appeared as if they were there) to repair or re-install or uninstall them, the system wouldn't let me go any forward.</p>
<p>recently (yesterday actually) I "gambled" by "re-installing" Windows 10 without touching my data.</p>
<p>I took time but it WORKED ! ! ! ! ... the downside is that I am trying now to re constitute the applications I had installed before this latest operation which is quite a job since I have now Windows 10 without any of the applications I used to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I was wondering whether it was a virus infection but I am protected by an antivirus Kaspersky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dont you think it is some sort of a bug ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>External device is not the issue as it happens with all devices disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting tool shows no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the freeze continues to happen, what could I do to at least know which module is causing the freeze?</p>
<p>

==========================================================<br />
I can only guess that you are referring to Windows <br />
XP Movie Maker 2.1.<br />
<br />
Some general info that may be worth a look:<br />
<br />
Since the issue is recent...it may be worth a try to <br />
do a System Restore to a time before the issue began.<br />
<br />
See the following article:<br />
<br />
(306084) How to restore Windows XP to a previous state<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=306084</a><br />
<br />
If you have Automatic Windows Updates...it is <br />
possible that a driver was downloaded and installed <br />
that is not as compatible with your system as the one <br />
you already had. Sometimes this occurs with Video <br />
Drivers. You could try a System Restore or a Driver <br />
Roll-back<br />
<br />
(306546) HOW TO: Use the Driver Roll Back Feature to Restore<br />
a Previous Version of a Device Driver in Windows XP<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;306546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;306546</a><br />
<br />
Three possible causes for Movie Maker issues<br />
<br />
1) Incompatible source files...(possibly...MPG or MP3)<br />
sometimes it helps to disable filters.<br />
<br />
Tools / Options / Compatibility tab...uncheck all filters...<br />
also it may be worth a try to left click the "Restore All <br />
Defaults" button.<br />
<br />
Many formats are reportedly compatible with<br />
Movie Maker but the most reliable choices are:<br />
<br />
Photos -&nbsp; bmp<br />
Video -&nbsp; wmv<br />
Audio -&nbsp; wma, wav, wmv<br />
<br />
2) Corrupt source files...the only fix for this would be to <br />
remove source files from the project one at a time and <br />
try to save each time until the problem file is discovered.<br />
<br />
3) Project is too large or complex for system resources.<br />
Create several smaller projects...saving each one as WMV. <br />
Then re-import the collected WMV files / drag all to timeline <br />
and Save the final movie.<br />
<br />
Windows XP Movie Maker 2.1.....<br />
To save as a .wmv movie file...<br />
Type...Ctrl+P (or go to...File / Save Movie File)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to open the Save Movie Wizard /<br />
Choose...My Computer /<br />
Next /<br />
Enter a Name and a Save Location /<br />
Next /<br />
Tick...'Best Quality For My Computer'<br />
Next/<br />
Wait while the movie is saved /<br />
Finish...<br />
<br />
Windows XP Movie Maker 2.1.....<br />
To save as a DV-AVI movie file...<br />
(and several other options)<br />
Type...Ctrl+P (or go to...File / Save Movie File)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to open the Save Movie Wizard /<br />
Choose...My Computer /<br />
Next /<br />
Enter a Name and a Save Location /<br />
Next /<br />
Show More Choices /<br />
Other Settings /<br />
Open the drop window and choose...DV-AVI /<br />
Next /<br />
Wait while the movie is saved /<br />
Finish...<br />

<h2>            GH3 x Guitarra rock Band</h2>
                    
<p>Fala galera , comprei o GH3 e ja tinha uma guitarra que veio com o world tour (Rock Band) , exatamente esse: http://rockbandsongaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/rockband2_guitar.jpg.<br />
A guitarra funciona perfeitamente no world tour e no smash hits, porem ao tentar ligar no GH3 aparece a mensagem: an unsupported guitar peripheral has been detected xbox.<br />
Ate pensei que era o jogo ou algo assim , porem no controle ele funciona normal.</p>

<p>Alguem saberia me dizer se realmente vou ter que comprar uma guitarra nova ??</p>

<p>Obrigado a todos.</p>

perform a clean boot of your operating system</a> and then trying to reinstall the game to see if that helps out. Alternatively, you may also want to use the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
App Troubleshooter</a> to see if that does the trick as well. If you no longer have the option to choose certain themes, it may be probable that they are no longer available for use.</p>

<p>Hi Piccoli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying. Sorry to hear that the issue is still persisting. It is possible that Microsoft Solitaire has gone through an update that no longer supports the skins/themes that you previously had, making them unavailable. Sadly, we on the forums do
 not have the tools to assist with that. If you haven't already, you may wish to contact the Microsoft Casual Games forum as previously suggested by XBF Chris, or you can always head over to
<a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Ideas</a> to make a suggestion that they should be returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps out a bit more.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista will not boot at startup</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 1525. My wife primarily uses the laptop for online access, some work-related activity (Word Docs, Spreadsheets) -- nothing major.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, after the Dell system startup, the laptop would not boot correctly. It would spool after the Windows flag and never fully boot. What I've done thus far to attempt fixing the issue (to no avail):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Launch Startup Repair (recommended) - No resolution</p>
<p>2) Ran Dell Diagnostics - Received error code: 2000-0333</p>
<p>2) Selected Repair Your Computer from Advanced Boot Options and attempted a System Restore - It failed due to an I/O device error (0x8007045D)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure what specifically is the problem. Please help troubleshoot and fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>D</p>

<h2>            File Explorer Tabs, Ribbon and title bar missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Client of mine had a strange occurrence in&nbsp;Windows 10 Enterprise x64. their file explorer, once maximized looses its tabs, ribbon and title bar. Has anyone come across this issue? Restarting explorer.exe did not fix the issue. I had the client reboot and
 it was fixed. The client mentioned this is the second time it has happened. Are there any fix other than a reboot? What is causing this to happen?</p>
<p>

    <title>Task Scheduler...what are these tasks and who scheduled them&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coolnewyorker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler...what are these tasks and who scheduled them&#63;</h2>
                    In the beginning, MSE did scan automatically as I had scheduled it to ...and then two days ago, it stopped. I toggled between the options&nbsp; [run when logged in but not in use]... and did not make any diff.<br />
<br />
So.... I looked around and stumbled upon Task Scheduler (which I used to tweak a lot during my XP years) and was dumbfounded to see 15 tasks, scheduled to run on different times and on different triggers...indefinitely. I do not know any of them and I did not
 schedule any, either. I noticed I was slowed down when it was running. So I disabled all.<br />
<br />
48 hours later, my PC does not seem any different (I was expecting catastrophic event/s)...MSE still not running on schedule(which is quite ok with me as I decided I'd really rather&nbsp;run it when I want to).<br />
<br />
Question: What are these tasks and why were they scheduled to run indefinitely? ....and who scheduled them? And why disabling them does not seem to matter? Was MSE responsible for any of these?<br />
<br />
Btw, would WMC recording preclude MSE auto start? (Because on both failed starts,&nbsp; WMC happened to be&nbsp;recording)

            Hi coolnewyorker,<br />
<br />
For Windows Vista I have 16 scheduled tasks. For Windows 7 there are 34:-)<br />
<br />
If you look carefully enough you will see the scheduled tasks pf the Library repeated in the Local list, so there are not as many tasks as first imagined. However, some of the tasks referred to in your TS Library refer to your PC manufacturers (presumably HP?)
 service and advanced service plan. All scheduled tasks are put there for a reason. While we know that information is being transferred to Microsoft via some of the scheduled tasks - health of PC, system crashes etc, it is difficult to know whether HP are also
 accessing information - one only 'assumes' they are.<br />
<br />
As for being in any trouble or disfavour, all I can say, and this is my personal option, is that it is your PC and you can do what you want with it - and that includes enabling and disabling things. Do you actually have a service plan or extended service plan
 with HP? Who or what is Antonio Properties? While I agree it is annoying to see loads of tasks scheduled to run or even running and slowing down your PC it isn't always wise to diable them 'unless' you know what they are doing in the first place. SR, for example,
 is something I never personally use, I regulalry backup my system using Acronis True Image software (do I trust Microsoft's Backup software in Vista and Windows 7? Actually No I don't; I have had enough disasters to last me a life time after using the built
 in backup application of Vista and Windows 7 - luckily I always keep backups created by Acronis).

            Hi Coolnewyorker,<br />
<br />
Your question on 'who scheduled them' - the answer is Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Amongst the scheduled tasks you will find System Restore, Windows Defragmenter, Windows Troubleshooter, Windows Customer Experience. You will also find tasks to check your PC's health. That is just to name a few.<br />
<br />
As for disabling them not making any difference you may find that not a lot, if anything, is actually scheduled to work when you are actually on your PC. In many cases most&nbsp; of the schedules run at around 2am or, in the case of everything Microsoft has scheduled
 on my machine, it doesn't run at all simply because my system is shut down when most of the application are scheduled - or at least it used to be. I systematically went through them and changed the time to when I was online so that the information Microsoft
 needs is uploaded - for example files that are created when the PC crashes etc.<br />
<br />
Regarding MSE, like most applications that run on a schedule there is a heavy reliance upon the PC being idle for so many minutes before the schedule starts. If you are running another program, such as WMC in recording mode the system is not idle, it is recording;
 therefore, yes, WMC recording could affect the MSE running.

<h2>            Night light</h2>
                    <p>I have problem with night light. It was on but windows update needed a restart to finish updates so I restarted. but after the restart I went back to night light settings and everything was highlighted and I was not able to turn it on or off. I tried to
 wait for the time that I scheduled it to turn of and that didn't work to. Is there any solution?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
We would like to verify if you have you tried turning on/off Night light in Action Center?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly go to Action Center, tap or click Night light button to toggle it on or off.<br />
<br />
You may also perform a clean boot and check if you will encounter the same issue. A
<strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.&nbsp; For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />

            The screenshot mentions location services have you checked to see if it's turned on? The message implies that it isn't.

<h2>            Windows Media Player has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 8.1</p>
<p>When I click on an mp3 file it starts to play, but after a few seconds it stops and I get the message 'Windows Media Player has stopped working'.</p>
<p>I have tried searching the web for a Windows Media Player re-install, but I seem to be bombarded by options that want to install all manner of software and browser options.</p>
<p>Where can I get a clean version of Windows Media Player that just gives me what I'm asking for without being bombarded with software and browser options that I don't want?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Ian</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ian,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Windows Media Player on Windows 8.1 and still the issue persists. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check
 if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Run the Windows Media Player Settings Troubleshooter</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This troubleshooter is an automated Windows 8.1 inbuilt tool which finds and fixes the common issues with the
<strong><em>Windows Media Player settings</em></strong>. Perform these steps to run this tool and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>c) In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on “<strong><em>Windows Media Player settings</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Check the troubleshooting report and share the details with us. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue. If that doesn’t
 help, then </span>let us check if this is caused by any corrupted system files on the computer. Let us run the SFC Scan and check the scan result.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 2: Run an SFC Scan</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The “<strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong>” command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from that menu.</span></p>
<p><span>b) On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>sfc /scannow</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c) Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer to the article given below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, then check if there are any third party software conflicts on the computer causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 3: Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. Perform a clean boot on the computer by following the steps given in the link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” given in the section “<strong><em>How to perform a clean boot</em></strong>” from this link to perform a clean boot
 on the computer. You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows
 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” given in the section “<strong><em>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</em></strong>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the article “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for Windows 8, given under the section
 “More Information” to reset the computer to start as usual from the above link.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the updates on this issue.</span>

</p><p><span>This troubleshooter is an automated Windows 8.1 inbuilt tool which finds and fixes the common issues with the
<strong><em>Windows Media Player settings</em></strong>. Perform these steps to run this tool and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>

</p><p>Good afternoon</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Methods 1 and 2, but neither were successful</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 reported: 'Resource Protection found corrupt files, but was unable to fix some of them'.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got the cbs.log file created by Method 2, but I don't know how to get this to you, or if it's of any use to you anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began to try Methiod 3, but quite frankly this is out of my scope of knowledge and understanding.&nbsp; It's mentioning things that I have no idea what they mean.&nbsp; To avoid getting into an irreversable mess, I aborted the session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there must be a simple resolution to this?&nbsp; It's not rocket-science?&nbsp; Or is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate your further assistance with resolving the issue, without the need for me to first attend a MicroSoft training course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in anticipation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest regards</p>
<p>

<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for getting back to us with the troubleshooting results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could be due to the corrupted system files on the computer. Since, the SFC Scan has detected the corrupted system files and was unable to fix them, let us run the
<strong><em>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) </em></strong>Tool to fix this and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Use Deployment Image Servicing and Management to fix the System File Corruption</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run the DISM Tool, you may follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from that menu.</span></p>
<p><span>b) On the <strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong> window, type the following commands, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>” after each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c) After completing the process, type “<strong><em>Exit</em></strong>” and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>” on the

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I understand that you have tried all the troubleshooting methods that I had given in my previous posts. It would be great if you can share the details of the troubleshooting results
 with us, so that we can assist you further as according to that.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would like to clarify some information that you have given in the previous post.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) By mentioning “<strong><em>deleted the media player</em></strong>”, do you mean that you have uninstalled the Windows Media Player from the “<strong><em>Turn Windows features
 on or off</em></strong>”?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) Were there any corrupted files detected when you ran the SFC Scan on the computer? If yes, was it repaired automatically by the SFC Scan?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3) Did you check the troubleshooting report after running the Windows Media Player Settings Troubleshooter to check if it provides any useful information regarding the issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If not, I would suggest you to check the troubleshooting report and share the details with us.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You have also mentioned in your previous reply that this issue happens as the Windows Media Player rebuilds the Media Library on the computer. So, I think that this could be due
 to some issues with the Windows Media Player Library on the computer. Let us run the Windows Media Player Library Troubleshooter and check if that helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When run as administrator in troubleshooting it says my library is corrupted.I press ok and the library rebuilds but still crashes. I Have tried turning windows features&nbsp;off and re starting,same error and I have deleted media player from the runappdata command
 so it re installs and same problem.</p>
<p>The scs shows no errors neither did the DISM.exe clean up image.</p>
<p>Is there any windows update you know of that I could delete that was meant for the media player.</p>
<p>My library is only taken from my c drive ,so I don't know why it is corrupted.</p>
<p>Today for instance it is shutting immediately .I have noticed that sometimes it works when pc is first booted up and when I go on internet or windows mail it then closes ,could this be causing a fault.</p>
<p>I have tried it on a different user I have set up (my son) and that media player works.
</p>
<p>Any more ideas you have would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards Roy.</p>
