    <title>Why does it take 30 days for my account information to be updated or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesl19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does it take 30 days for my account information to be updated or to add a subscription&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just bought a xbox One after having a 360 for years and not using it, finally upgraded for a new game I wanted and I got a live membership to play online and when I entered it rejected the code. Now I bought it from a reputable game store with the game,
 I tried several times each time it said there was a problem, I tried on the PC and it did the same thing. I originally created my Microsoft account years ago when I lived in New Zealand, Now living in Australia I tried to update my region but I cant do that
 cause of this 30 day cooling off period I guess. Really annoying. So I thought ah well Ill just put my CC in and use that for this month but It rejected that too. Almost seems as my moneys not good enough for Microsoft.</p>
<p>Anyone shed some light why it takes so damn long for a update to security? Every other company out there just flicks me a txt if I update details or a email. Why is this so hard Microsoft?&nbsp;</p>

<p>What it sounds like is this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Whenever doing something major (changing passwords, changing emails, changing security proofs, changing regions) on an account MS requires a code be sent to what they call a security proof which is normally either an email address or text to a phone number
 for security purposes. This is done to protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the account holder no longer has access to one of the security proofs BUT still has access to the email and password on the account MS will allow you to change the security proof on the account BUT it takes 30 days for that security proof change to
 take affect this is to ensure the security of the account. Once the 30 day hold is put into place there is not stopping it. You will still be able to sign into the account and everything but you will not be able to do anything that requires a security code
 verification being sent out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> kang cheng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 slow copy and cut speed</h2>
                    <p>I regularly move files from drive C to other drives. It used to be that files were moved instantly. Now, however, it takes minutes to move them. The speed is now very slow and often drop to kilobytes per seconds. Moving files from the same drive is still
 as fast as usual,&nbsp;even dozens of gigabytes can be moved immediately, but moving a 100 mb file from other drives is slow. I have tried fragmenting my disk and updating but to no avail.</p>

            There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

                    <p>Hi there, I'm using Windows 10, and for some reason my PC wouldn't boot up past the windows loading screen . So I did 3 hard reset to get it into automated recovery and selected system restore from a week ago. It is taking more than 24 hours for it to complete,
 and as currently stuck on restoring files. Should I turn off the laptop and start again?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Junior.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go ahead and hold the power button to power off laptop as it's not going to complete.  Wait 30 minutes to cool down and then start it back up, report back what happens. 
<br />
<br />Hopefully it' isn't a failed hard drive but you'll find out soon enough. 
<br />
<br />Next create bootable media on another PC and follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer to access the various Repairs given:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If these fail choose instead Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Les
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience of having to suggest the re-route, but Technet has a lot of experts there that know the ins and outs of enterprise issues; especially Terminal Services and Remote Desktop for clients. So, they will be better able to diagnose and determine whats causing the close down.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your corporation.

            Check to make sure any third party security software that came with your computer is not enabled. Examples include:
<br />
<br />- Encryption software
<br />- Third party facial recognition software, might be conflicting with Windows built in software.
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br />1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings - skip this step if you are not running Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise only
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

            Was there a Windows update before the fingerprint scanner disappeared?
<br />You could go back to the previous version if it was within 10 days.
<br />Try these command under powershell with admin one at a time:
<br />SFC /SCANNOW
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup 
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />

<h2>            Bluetooth &#40;Lenovo P400 Touch Laptop&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>So, after a few months of having this, I did some updates to all of the drivers and the chip-set (just updates, not replacing anything, not inserting anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began to see an "Other Device" in the device manager (I have to go there every few days when I accidentally hit the screen brightness, Lenovo's laptops have a weird thing where they won't return to full brightness, but that's a separate problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under 'other devices', I saw 'SMS', and when I went to hit 'update driver', no results.</p>
<p>After a little bit of digging, I was able to find the following hardware IDs:</p>
<p>BTHENUM\{00001132-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb}_VID&amp;00010075_PID&amp;0100<br />
BTHENUM\{00001132-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb}_LOCALMFG&amp;0002 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, with those in hand, I plugged those into Google, with no results beyond "messaging access service" or similar things as the closest matches. Trying to manually update the drivers through the 'browse drivers on your computer' option revealed a ton of
 drivers for it, but none of which appeared to match it perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, when I went to hit 'show hidden items' in the device manager, to see if anything ELSE was being weird, two more devices popped up in the 'other devices' section next to our mystery "SMS", marked "Bluetooth Peripheral Device".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One (the upper of the two) yielded the following hardware IDs:</p>
<p>BTHENUM\{00001800-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb}_VID&amp;00010075_PID&amp;0100</p>
BTHENUM\{00001800-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb}_LOCALMFG&amp;0002
<p>
</p><p>and the other:</p>
<p>BTHENUM\{00001801-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb}_VID&amp;00010075_PID&amp;0100</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Right Click on the Other Device and delete it - then reboot to see if the device re-appears.<br />

Bluetooth devices around you. For each detected Bluetooth device, it displays the following
<br />
information: Device Name, Bluetooth Address, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, First
<br />
Detection Time, Last Detection Time, and more. BluetoothView can also notify you when a
<br />
new Bluetooth device is detected, by displaying a balloon in your taskbar or by playing a
<br />
small beep sound. - FREE<br />

<h2>            Mouse pointer is running too fast</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after the last windows upgrade my mouse's pointer is running so fast I can't keep track with it.</p>
<p>I've changed the settings in control panel to reduce the speed.</p>
<p>Now that works kind of ok after i login but the problem persists on the login page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen another thread offering a couple of standard solutions but they don't work.
</p>
<p>Also I know how to change my mouse settings so I don't need these URLs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Go to the mouse maker support site. Ask the question there. And look to see if they have a newer version of the mouse driver.

            <p>Hello KelvinShone, <br />
<br />
Since you are not able to download programs or software on Windows RT Surface, you will not be able to sync your Surface with iTunes. iTunes would need to have an App in the Windows Apps store to be able to download for Windows RT Surface.
<br />
<br />
Do a search on the internet for sync iTunes and Windows RT and you can find 3rd party links that might help with your issue.

 Sticky notes: not working restart 80004005, handwriting recognition:ink is not working on your computer right now, snipping tool: not working on your computer right now ERROR. I don't know if these problems are associated with NoteOne, trial version expired.
 or somethig to do with Microsoft Office, I got office 2007 from school (brought it, due to specific classes taken) or somthing else i did! I have tried several thing from the help section and nothing works!<br />

<h2>            C1900107 error with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried looking around but nobody has my issue. I ran the update and it was perfectly installing however I had to go somewhere so stupidly I left windows to do its thing, came back after a few hours and it had crashed so I tried running the update again
 but got the error C10900107.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Clean boot - didn't help, same error message</p>
<p>2. Download direct from windows - it downloads and verifies then the install window closes and nothing happens</p>
<p>3. Downloaded on USB then ran set up from USB - I got the errors as shown on the images</p>
<p>4. Restore windows to before I ran the initial upgrade - couldn't restore for some reason</p>
<p>5. Force update via cmd - resulted in same error C10900107<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dfa2135-10e6-4660-b171-da1e06c4fb68" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/daa30377-c124-4c3c-9f40-b4b0f5a50f2b" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34054b27-5685-4225-ae04-b8d2d6de102b" /></p>

            Hi!
<br />
<br />My name is German, and I am here to help you.
<br />
<br />To be able to run Python, you must first install it. The command to install it is the following:
<br />
<br />sudo apt install python3-pip
<br />
<br />Any other questions I am at your disposal.
<br />
<br />Have a great day!

</p><p>The menu/tool bar from the old version of Skype is no longer available with the new Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The options on how you can configure your settings have different way to access. To do that, sign in to Skype &gt; go to your profile icon &gt; click settings.

            hi <br />
<br />
thanks for the advice<br />
<br />
The lack of the driver made startup awful.&nbsp; I had to put vista back on my system and then do an upgrade.
<br />
<br />
the drivers were&nbsp; the memory technology drivers.<br />
<br />
<br />
cheers

            Battery mode "pop-up" is a "feature" added by Asus.&nbsp; This is to tell the "user" when the laptop is switched from the "wall power" (AC.)&nbsp; If this is happening by itself, it can be a hardware problem with the AC adapter.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t Customize a Folder Thumbnail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a lost soul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Customize a Folder Thumbnail</h2>
                    <p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to customze the thumbnails of each folder in my PC, so I know which folder contains which image.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the thumbnails of some folders aren't changing when I try to customize it. They just still display default thumbnails when I click Apply and OK buttons after customizing them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To customize folder thumbnail I usually right-click a folder -&gt; click "properties"-&gt; go into "customize" tab -&gt; click "Choose Picture" button under "Folder pictures" tab -&gt; select the thumbnail&nbsp;image -&gt; and click "Apply" and "OK" button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I am able to freely customize the&nbsp;thumbnails of some folders, it doesn't work on other folders even when I'm doing exactly the same thing. What can be the problem here?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for trying to help me! </p>

<h2>            Lifecam Studio not recognised in USB port</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been using my Lifecam Studio now for a year without a problem. It is, sorry was, great.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just now I tried to upgrade the latest firmware from the Microsoft site, downloaded it and it failed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I tried uninstalling everything, reinstalling it but the camera simply isn't recognised any more when I plug it in. Nothing, it's useless. By the way, I'm running a top of the range Windows 8 PC so there are no issues there</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought I'd try it on a Windows 7 notebook, again, Windows does not even recognise new hardware is plugged into the USB. I tried installing the programs on that notebook but when the software requires the camera to be plugged in, I can't get any further
 because it isn't recognised by the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft, this seems to be a recurring problem after firmware updates, see this thread (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/lifecam-studio-stopped-working-after-firmware/40084234-42c1-40c7-96eb-4d1a30092709?page=1), but
 no one is coming up with a satisfactory answer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not happy I've spent £100 on this camera only for your firmware to break it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I look forward to a speedy reply!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hywel</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;You may try rolling back the driver. </p>

            Rolling back the driver will never fix a firmware update on hardware, because it isn't a driver issue. It's a problem with the firmware which has only partially updated on the camera.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft really need to address this problem by removing the current update and fixing the problem.&nbsp;</div>
