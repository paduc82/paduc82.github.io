    <title>After Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client connected access to Internet sites - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sprs29593  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client connected access to Internet sites becomes unavailable.  </h2>
                    
<p>I have Asus laptop with Windows 7 64-bit Home Edition which</p>
<p>I want to use for work from home. My company provided me</p>
<p>with special website from which I'm able to successfully</p>
<p>establish Cisco AnyConnect VPN connection.</p>
<p>But each after this VPN connection has been set, I loose Internet connection, so I cannot open any website on my Firefox, Internet Explorer, my Thunderbird e-mail box also becomes unavailable. And the only way to get normal Internet connection back is to
 reboot my laptop.</p>
<p>I asked for the help support guy who is responsible for VPN connection in my company. He checked my&nbsp; proxy configurations both manual and automatic, and some other</p>
<p>things from VPN side, but found nothing wrong.</p>
<p>So he thinks there is something inside Windows 7 which blocks network access, but he is not Windows 7 expert.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

            Hi PAULATIERNEY
<br />
<br />Delete an admin account via Settings
<br />Step 1:&nbsp;Open Settings app by simultaneously pressing Windows logo + I keys on the keyboard.
<br />Step 2:&nbsp;In the Settings app, navigate to&nbsp;Accounts&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Family and other accounts. If you are on Enterprise edition of Windows 10, please navigate to Accounts &gt; Other accounts.
<br />Step 3:&nbsp;Here, you can see all admin as well as standard user accounts. As said before, the account which you have currently signed in doesn’t appear in the list here. For instance, if you have two admin accounts “A” and “B” on your PC, you need to sign in to account “A” to delete admin account “B.”
<br />Step 4:&nbsp;Click on the admin account which you want to delete or remove. Click the&nbsp;Remove&nbsp;button.
<br />Step 5:&nbsp;When you see the following confirmation dialog, click&nbsp;Delete account and data&nbsp;button to delete the account and all data from the account.
<br />
<br />Delete admin account via Control Panel
<br />Step 1:&nbsp;Open Control Panel. Change&nbsp;View by&nbsp;to&nbsp;Small icons. Click&nbsp;User Accounts.
<br />Step 2:&nbsp;Click&nbsp;Manage another account&nbsp;link to see all user accounts on the PC.
<br />Step 3:&nbsp;Click on the admin account which you want to delete or remove.
<br />Step 4:&nbsp;Click&nbsp;Delete the account&nbsp;link.
<br />Step 5:&nbsp;When you see the following confirmation dialog, either click&nbsp;Delete Files or Keep Files&nbsp;button. If you click the Keep Files button, Windows automatically saves the data of the account in a folder on your current desktop before deleting the account.

            Hi Paula.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Make sure you have an Admin Account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info.  
<br />
<br />Then you can delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People.
<br />
<br />If any problems just let me know and I'll walk you through the solution.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Infected winlogon.exe and explorer.exe deleted accidentally on XP Pro PC- need recovery console help</h2>
                    
<p>hi</p>
<p>Running WinXP Pro SP3 on Dell Optiplex and got infected with trojans in both winlogon and explorer exe files. AVG asked me&nbsp;if i wanted to force removal and i stupidly agreed. Now i get the BSOD and the message that "Windows Logon unexpectedly terminated".&nbsp;
 &nbsp;it's on a work PC and the only CD we have is the Dell re-install CD and i know i need recovery console as the first step. I do not know if recovery console is on it and then i need help getting the explorer.ex_ and winlogon.ex_&nbsp; uncomprressed and back to
 their proper places.</p>
<p>I'm not a total newbie but it's been some time since i used recovery console.</p>
<p>Help?&nbsp; Thanks in advance and regards to all</p>
<p>Morey</p>

<p>Try to be more precise with the error messages you see so there is no guessing or trying things.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a popular error message that sounds like yours (maybe):</p>
<p>STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
The Windows Logon Process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000034 (0x0000000 0x0000000).<br />
The system has been shut down.</p>
<p>What does your message say exactly?</p>
There should be backup copies of all critical XP system files already on your hard disk in the windows\system32\dllcache folder (that is what that folder is for), so you may not need to do any expanding.
<p>I would post up the exact error message, make a bootable Recovery Console CD, run chkdsk /r even if it finds nothing to do, and then see about replacing the missing or suspicious files either by copying in the replacement backup copies from the Recovery
 Console, or from another CD you can make if the Recovery Console gives you a hard time (make the Recovery Console CD first).</p>
<p>First, you need to boot on something...</p>
<p>You can make a bootable XP Recovery CD as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt.</p>
<p>First verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to
 be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>
<p>I decided to save up points for a new puppy instead of a pony!</p>

<p><span><span>As far as I can see you now only have one failing update.<br />
.NET Framework 4.5.1 for Windows 7 x64-based Systems (KB2858725).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You seem to have two anti-virus products installed, Adaware and AVG! Two will conflict. Which was installed first? Which would you prefer to keep?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and run ADWCleaner and upload a copy of the report produced to your OneDrive. Remove all that it finds. :<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you take the precaution of creating a system restore point before running ADWCleaner, to guard against unforeseen consequences. Select Start, Control Panel,
 System, System Protection, and click the <strong>Create</strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, right click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and click <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the drop down menu.. Type
<strong>cd\</strong> and press ENTER. Type "<strong>chkdsk c: /r</strong>" without the quotes and hit ENTER.&nbsp;Make sure you include the spaces indicated. Enter
<strong>Y</strong> when asked whether you wish to run chkdsk on restarting the computer. Type
<strong>exit</strong>, press the ENTER key and restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please run System File Checker and say if it cannot fix corrupted files:<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable
 the item. It is a </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Run Autoruns and select the

<strong>Text (*txt)</strong>. The file name changes to <strong>AutoRuns.txt</strong>. Click the

<div>Make a backup of your message store as it is likely somewhat corrupt.&nbsp; Make sure your inbox is not over a few hundred megabytes or else it will self-destruct and you will lose all the messages.&nbsp; After making a backup, then do a File | Folder

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade C1900101 30018 Error</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Y510P (64 bit x86, NVIDIA GeForce, 16GB RAM) and received my notice that the Windows 10 upgrade is available. I have tried upgrading at least 8 times. Via Windows Update and the media method, I get to 30% and it reverts the operating system
 back to 8.1. The error code reported is C190010 30018. The troubleshooting link does not provide any information on this error. My understanding is that this means there is a driver issue. How do I tell what driver is at issue so I can uninstall the driver
 and install after the upgrade? Is there a log?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen many solutions offered for the Windows 10 upgrade problem and I have tried most of them to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help. This upgrade process has been maddening.</p>

<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard) and then check if you still face this issue while installing Windows 10. This is to check if the issue is caused by any external devices
 connected to the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span>Update the Device Drivers on the Computer for all the devices installed on the computer before you install Windows 10 and check if that helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Type “<strong>Updates</strong>” in the search bar and click on “<strong>Check for Updates</strong>” from the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>Now click on “<strong>Check for Updates”</strong> button on the right pane, to receive a fresh list of updates and then install all the updates listed there.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>If no driver updates are available via Windows Update, then you may install them for all the devices on the computer from the Computer Manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span>Go to the computer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers available for all the devices on the computer and then install them by following the instructions given in the website. And let us know the statues.</span></p>

            <p>I'm having same problem when I upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1(64bit).&nbsp;&nbsp; I've&nbsp;searched for many different websites for solution to this problem, and yet, I couldn't find a single solution.&nbsp; (Not even from MS Solution)&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I have tried to notify
 Microsoft of this problem, yet, I didn't get any feed back or solution to this problem.&nbsp;Do they not care??!!! &nbsp; So far, It's been horrible experience!!!!&nbsp; This upgrade is supposedly best for all Microsoft users, however, I find it tedious and time wasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Anyhow, I hope that Microsoft will have solution to this problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</p>
<p>This issue could be due to change in Windows update settings or some software conflicts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to try to refer to the below Microsoft Help Article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-8</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also temporarily disable or try to uninstall third party antivirus software.&nbsp;Check if you are able to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disable Anti virus:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it
 to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, refer to the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would suggest you use the Media Creation Tool in the below link and choose Upgrade option to upgrade to Windows 10. Before upgrading to Windows 10, I suggest you to take a backup of important files and folders to the external
 drive. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem too, error code C1900101-30018 &amp; spent many hours &amp; day's trying to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't drivers of antivirus etc. frequently talked about. &nbsp;It was in fact the product key causing the problem.
</p>
<p>And my product key was a valid and legitimate edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how long each attempt takes and how frustrating it is, So....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what worked for me.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, &nbsp;Make sure, your old copy of windows is "Activated" (Google it if not sure how to check) If not, don't worry once you have your Valid windows product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, Download Windows 10 to a USB stick , and set the computer to boot from the USB stick at start up in the BIOS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most computer's access it by pressing F2 on start up. &nbsp;(yours may be different please check with your PC manufacturer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, Have your windows 25 digit product code ready, But, DO NOT ENTER IT, press" skip" until windows 10 is fully installed-This is Very important- should there be an issue with the product key,
</p>
<p>You can activate it later &nbsp;with the product key once windows 10 it fully installed.</p>
<p>You can contact Microsoft customer support later as I did to resolve a valid product key issue when trying to activate windows 10 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a video on you tube which goes through the USB boot procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laNdSd-FAL8</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Timeout Error - 0x80072ee2</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand new computer, HP Envy, with windows 8.1 installed.&nbsp;I haven't had time to really install anything, or&nbsp;personalise the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When working through the Desktop, my computer works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when working through the Apps, any app, and I do mean any App with internet connectivity is affected.
</p>
<p>I can't open the App store, at all. Other apps I have installed fully based on internet connectivity will either not open or give me an error message.</p>
<p>Those apps that are partially based, such as the video app, will open, but anything requiring internet connection simply doesnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can use anything requiring internet connection through the desktop side of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted the computer, run the troubleshooter in all ways possible, trawled the internet, but none of the answers are relevant. all I have done recently is install the required and&nbsp;optional&nbsp;updates from windows update. Now this is also displaying
 an error and saying I have never installed any updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was fine before, and I have no idea why some things are not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jennifer</p>

            There can be several causes but to start with, you can try following. Please try these options one by one and check after each option.
<br />
<br />1. Troubleshoot Power
<br />Type troubleshoot in Cortana Search &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />2. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; sleep &gt; Click Additional power settings to open Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />3. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Reach to Power options as in previous step &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver (Only for laptops)
<br />Shut down your computer &gt; Detach power chord &gt; Remove battery (if fixed no need to remove) &gt; Attach power chord &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Batteries &gt; Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System &gt; Uninstall &gt; Shutdown the computer &gt; Remove the power chord &gt; Attach your battery &gt; Attach your power chord &gt; Reboot the computer to automatically install the driver
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Can I get my free Windows&nbsp;10 upgrade even if I didn’t reserve? 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. The easiest way to get the free upgrade is to reserve, but you can upgrade even if you don’t reserve.</p>
<p>Once Windows&nbsp;10 is available, we’ll begin notifying devices that their free upgrade is available. Just open the
<em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> app to schedule your upgrade. Note: Some notifications will go out as soon as Windows&nbsp;10 is available; others may go out in the weeks or months following.</p>

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try the following steps before you un-install the drivers from device manager. Now, un-install the drivers from &nbsp;Device Manager, install the latest drivers from the&nbsp;ASUS website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Press Windows + Pause Break to open System Properties </span></li><li><span>Click Advance&nbsp;system settings.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Hardware Tab</strong>, Select <strong>"Device installation settings"&nbsp;</strong></span></li><li><span>Select No, let me chose what to do.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Never install Driver software from Windows Update</strong></span></li><li><span>Click Apply and OK.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, go to device manager un-install the driver and install the latest one from ASUS website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

    <title>Skype Pro Subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> selvingreen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Pro Subscription</h2>
                    <div>It is a bit curious that I have been a SKYPE user since early 2002 and a SKYPE Pro Subscriber since it was first introduced. I am still paying a USD $3.00 monthly charge for SKYPE Pro service that is deducted religiously from my SKYPE credits on the 11th
 of each and every month. The SKYPE Pro service was discontinued some time ago but I guess the existing SKYPE Pro subscribers were “grandfathered” since we continued to enjoy and pay for the service. The chat option on SKYPE Support is made available only to
 Premium users and certain Administrators. Why isn’t a SKYPE Pro subscriber a Premium User since we are paying monthly for a Premium Service?</div>

The Microsoft Community has no real influence with Skype so if we had issues <br />
with Skype we would have to use the same resources available to all other users.<br />

<h2>            Incorrect tenure on xbox one</h2>
                    <p>Signed into my Xbox 360 i see my proper tenure of 10 years. Picture proof here:&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/a/skI3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/skI3c</a><br /><br />When i sign into my Xbox One, i only see 3 years. Recently when my years changed from 9 to 10 it rolled over correctly and displays on my Xbox 360. At the time it changed, my xbox one changed from 9 to 3. It now displays 3 years on my Xbox One profile page and the Xbox.com website. My 360 still shows proper tenure though.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I have already deleted my account from both consoles, cleared the cache and re-downloaded them. My 360 still shows 10 and the One shows 3. This is rather frustrating as it shows how much i support and love being an Xbox gamer and&nbsp;t&nbsp;take pride in my tenure. I've found numerous threads from 6 years ago to 2 days ago with people having the same issues and no definitive answer on any of the threads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skype numbers do work. If they did not, I would not have one for over a decade. Activation is immediate barring no external delays. This can be due to delays in the payment method used or if the country involved imposes delays verifying your residence. If

<div>Hi <strong>Tlallak</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the device?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To troubleshoot these issues follow the steps given in order:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1: Resynchronize your device with the receiver.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To resynchronize the mouse or the keyboard with the receiver, follow these steps.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: When you synchronize the mouse or the keyboard with the receiver, put the device near the receiver and put any other wireless keyboards and mouse at least 6 feet away.<br />
Press the button on the receiver, and then verify that the light on the receiver starts to blink.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note: Some newer Microsoft devices are permanently bound to their receiver and cannot be reset. If your device does not have a button, skip to Method 2.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If a dialog box appears on the screen in several seconds, follow the instructions that appear on the screen. Otherwise, go to the next step.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Press and release the Connect Channel button on the bottom of the mouse or the keyboard.<br />
b. Check the green light on the receiver. A steady green light means the synchronization was successful. If the problem persists, try steps 1 through 4 again.<br />
c. For the Wireless Notebook mouse: This issue can occur if the micro-switch on the bottom of the mouse is not released. Use a pin or a pen to try to release the button if it is depressed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Try different ports</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To determine whether the problem is related to the ports on the computer, use only the two cables that are included with the wireless desktop receiver, or the single cable that is included with a mouse.</div>
<div>Also follow the steps mentioned in the link below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Troubleshoot response failures in wireless keyboard or mouse</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398/en-us</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3: Configure the Bluetooth Device on the Computer.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
In order to do this, make sure that the Bluetooth service is started.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in for</div>
<div>Services. To do this, follow these steps.</div>
<div>Windows Vista or Windows 7</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click Start, copy and then paste (or type) the following command in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER:<br />
services.msc<br />
b. In the Programs list, click Services. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;• Double-click the Bluetooth Support service.<br />
&nbsp;• If the Bluetooth Support service is stopped, click Start.<br />
&nbsp;• On the Startup type list, click Automatic.<br />
&nbsp;• Click the Log On tab.<br />
&nbsp;• Click Local System account.<br />
&nbsp;• Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;• If you prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 4: How to connect the Bluetooth device to the computer</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Press and hold the Connect button on the bottom of the mouse. If your device has a battery indication light, it will blink and alternate between red and green to indicate that the device is discoverable.<br />
b. On the computer, open the Bluetooth software. The Bluetooth software is typically located in Control Panel. For more information about opening the Bluetooth software, see the "How to open the Bluetooth software" section.<br />
c. Click the Devices tab, and then click Add.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A Microsoft Bluetooth mouse does not require a passkey to connect to the computer. If you are prompted for a passkey, select No passkey. If you do not get the No Passkey option, try to enter 0000 as a passkey by using your keyboard.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following link for more information:</strong></div>

    <title>Change the Windows Update status to &#39;For Windows and other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnbespoke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the Windows Update status to &#39;For Windows and other products from Microsoft&#8217;.</h2>
                    <p>I am more than a little fed up with Win &amp; Microsoft refusing to acknowledge there can be big problems here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not an IT professional I have no idea what "script" writing or "PowerShell" is and I have no wish to learn and should NOT be expected so to do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make the following observations - </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Pc#1</strong> Control Panel (Category)/System &amp; Security/Windows Update page states on the bottom line: -</p>
<p>"You receive updates: - For Windows and other products from Microsoft." </p>
<p>and if I go to Control Panel (Category)/Uninstall programs/View Installed Updates; -
</p>
<p>Under MS Pro Plus 2010; I find 77 updates listed - some of which were subsequent to SP2&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Pc#2</strong> Control Panel (Category)/System &amp; Security/Windows Update page states on the bottom line: -</p>
<p>"You receive updates: - For Windows only."</p>
<p>and if I go to Control Panel (Category)/Uninstall programs/View Installed Updates; -
</p>
<p>Under MS Pro Plus 2010; I find just ONE update which is Service Pack 2 </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click "Get updates for other MS products" the link obtained does NOT achieve the updates required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot put it plainer than that - it is blatantly obvious that MS Off 2010 is NOT receiving updates on pc#2..</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE will someone at Windows // Microsoft supply detailed instruction as to how resolve this issue; -
</p>
<p>I repeat: - the "standard" "Change Updates" settings do NOT achieve the requirement - they simply end in an industry standard pathetic loop of wasting peoples time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive updates for Windows only it means the updates are delivered by Microsoft for Windows only which are
<strong>important</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive updates for Windows and other products from Microsoft then you will get updates for windows as well as the devices which are connected to your computer. Example: Display card, Audio card, Keyboard, Mouse, Network adapter etc.</p>

            <p>I have been through your first three links countless times before - I went through them once more to satisfy you - they do NOT solve the issue.</p>
<p>"Windows and other products from Microsoft" - I'm not interested in any ancillary functions (Keyboard, Audio, Mouse etc.) I'm interested ONLY (as has already been quite CLEARLY STATED) - Microsoft Office 2010 (32-bit) is NOT being updated past SP2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I want the Windows Update page to state: -</p>
<p>You receive updates for "Windows and other products from Microsoft" </p>
<p>and NOT just for Windows - then Office will duly receive updates as appropriate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Run the System Update Readiness Tool (Checksur.exe).</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>no problem identified.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I know my Windows 7 installation is 64-bit and MS Office 2010 is 32-bit</span></span></p>
<p>PLEASE will someone have the courtesy to READ the details of my problem and supply me with a proper fix. Thank you.</p>
