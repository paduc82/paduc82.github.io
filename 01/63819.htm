<h2>            Promoting Child Account &#47; Epic Friends</h2>
                    <p>I've reached out to support chat with no help...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son has an xbox account that was incorrectly set up as a child account years ago. I promoted that account to an "adult" and completed the credit card verification, but it is somewhere still flagged as a child account. (I know this bc when I go to look
 at links to social media, it says its restricted due to being a child account.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given it's a child account, we are unable to crossplay with our Epic Friends on Fortnite and obviously our investment is already put into the Epic account tied to the child account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! How can we make sure our account is reflected properly to an adult account, or are there any work arounds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p />

    <title>Minecraft 1.3GB update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasiew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft 1.3GB update</h2>
                    <p>I have already had to run this update twice and both times has resulted in my son not being able to reload his worlds. He has lost hours of building and gotten quite upset. It's now asking him to do it again?? If I don't do the update he can't go online and create with his friends, if I&nbsp;do do it then he can't reload the worlds again. I have tried removing them to the cloud to download from there but it makes no difference. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>What is the name of the screen saver and where did you get it?</p>
<p>If this is a free download, we may be able to download and test the screen saver. If you purchased the screen saver, you need to contact the developers of that program for help.</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Undoubtedly you received a new <strong>computer</strong>, not just a new CPU.</p>
<p>"CPU" stands for "Central Processing Unit." In modern personal<br />
computers, the CPU is a relatively small electronic chip, an<br />
integrated circuit. It sits on the motherboard, inside the computer's<br />
case. It is not the case itself, nor is it the total computer, which<br />
includes the case and everything within it. <br />
I'm not sure how the incorrect practice began of calling the whole<br />
computer the "CPU," but here's my guess: when you buy a computer, you<br />
normally get the case and what's in it, along with a monitor,<br />
keyboard, mouse, and perhaps a printer. All of these peripherals<br />
connect to the case. Because everything connects to the case, the case<br />
is "central" to everything else and the term "Central Processing Unit"<br />
is sometimes misunderstood and misapplied to it. <br />
I say the above, not to give you a hard time, but because using the<br />
terminology correctly can be very important. It may not happen in this<br />
case, but wrong terminology can get people trying to help you to<br />
misunderstand you, and for that reason give you incorrect answers.</p>

<p>Where did you get this screensaver? Are you sure it is compatible with<br />
Windows 7? How do you know? Have you tried others?</p>

            <p>I'm finally finding time to continue trying to get me DELL Dimension 4550 PC running Windows XP to boot.</p>
<p>I have executed the BIOS factory reset. "Try resetting BIOS to factory defaults by removing the motherboard battery, pressing/holding power button for ~30 sec and then reinstalling the battery (right-side-up!)." I did install a new battery.</p>
<p>the original harddrive (160 gb) has been installed in another PC and formatted and chkdsk run successfully using the Gateway PC.</p>
<p>I also have another old harddrive (30 gb) that I deinstalled from an old Gateway PC.</p>
<p>I also formatted it and chkdsk run successfully using the Gateway PC..</p>
<p>Both have been installed in the DELL PC.</p>
<p>160 gb as the Master and 30 gb as a slave.</p>
<p>30 gb as the Master and 160 gb as a slave.</p>
<p>160 gb by itself.</p>
<p>30 gb by itself.</p>
<p>every thing I try results in the following:</p>
<p>strike F1 to retry boot, F2 for setup utility</p>
<p>F2 takes me to the setup displan.</p>
<p>F1 does retry to boot.</p>
<p>I have also changed the boot sequence to try to boot from the CD drive 1st with my Windows XP os CD installed.</p>
<p>I have also tried using Windows 2000, Windows 98 and Windows 95 os CDs.</p>
<p>I get the DELL splash display with the F2 and F12 options with the same result.</p>
<p>I'm confident that I do not have a harddrive problem.</p>
<p>I'm not very technical and appreciate any additional suggestions from this forum.</p>

            If you formatted the drive(s), don't you need to then install an operating system?<br />
<br />
Is your Windows CD a genuine bootable XP installation CD or some kind of Recover Installation CD that came with the system?<br />
<br />
If you set the system to boot from the CD first, and the CD/DVD drive is not afflicted and the CD is a bootable CD, after the BIOS goes through the POST (Power On Self Test), you should see a message like this:<br />
<br />
Press any key to boot from CD...<br />
<br />
If you did a factory reset of the BIOS that sets it to default settings, so I would also poke around in there and see if it looks like the hard drive is found and recognized properly.&nbsp; Could be whatever the BIOS factory defaults are are not configured to (perhaps)
 automatically detect the HDD.<br />

<br />
Are you saying that you have configured the machine to boot from the CD drive first and with a (1) genuine Windows XP installation CD and with (2) a genuine Windows 2000 Pro installation CD, you are not able to boot into the installer?<br />
<br />
Windows 98 and Windows 95 CDs are not bootable.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Please quote exactly what is written on the labels of your XP and Win 2K CDs.<br />
<br />
When you press F12, do you see the message to select the CD drive and the "Press any key to boot from CD" message?<br />

<h2>            Limit to 3 home sets for Xbox one per year how to fix this. After 2 factory resets and never switching home Xbox.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys I'm currently going through a problem where I cannot make my dads account my home account. This really sucks since we both have separate Xboxs yet he has all the digital download games that we play together on online multiplayer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what really sucks more is that since I have had my Xbox (over a year now) not once had I changed my home Xbox, The only thing that I can think the reason to be is that through a few problems over the years, the only fix was to factory reset the Xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This really sucks since gaming through the original Xbox up to the Xbox one was what my dad and myself really bonded over and had possibly portrayed the best moments that i will always remember over the years.</p>
<p>So if you guys have any idea on how to fix this or if their is a way around it please, help a fellow out. All help is appreciated.</p>
<p>:)&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Xbox App Excessive CPU usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zarrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Xbox App Excessive CPU usage</h2>
                    The xbox app currently randomly uses upwards up 30% cpu and also raises svchost's process to like 30% too and it causes the app to freeze completely. &nbsp;This lasts usually anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. &nbsp;When I am playing a game and trying
 to invite people to my party it is very frustrating. &nbsp;I have tried googleing the problem but cannot find anything. &nbsp;People have posted in various places but never got an answer. &nbsp;Anyone know what the problem is? &nbsp;I have already tried reinstalling.

<p>
</p><p><span>For now let’s try simple troubleshooting method and check if this helps. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run <strong>System maintenance troubleshooter </strong>
and check if this helps. </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows + X</strong>&nbsp;keys on the keyboard and select&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue still, persist try the below method.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></p>

</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above methods did not help to fix the issue, try the below method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend you to boot the system in clean boot and check if the issue still persist.
<span>Clean boot</span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link

<p>Ciao io sono interessato a Gow 2 non avendo ancora giocato una partita multiplayer..., ma anche a me mi piacerebbe giocarci un pò. Purtroppo non ho tutto il tempo del mondo quindi prediligo l'abbonamento gold per 48 ore, perché è più facile che possa giocare
 nel week-end. Quest'estate sarà improbabile che rimanango il week-end a casa, ma durante l'anno accademico se sei interessato ci possiamo risentire. Mi piacerebbe trovare anche qualcuno per sbloccare gli obiettivi di Fable 3.</p>

            Hi DrunkenTen3992,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />The setting to disable pop up is different in different browsers
<br />
<br />1. Firefox
<br />Open Firefox &gt; Click 3 vertical bars on right top side &gt; Options &gt; Privacy &amp; security &gt; Scroll down and uncheck Block pop-up Windows
<br />
<br />2. Chrome 
<br />Open Chrome &gt; Click 3 vertical dots on top right side &gt; Settings &gt; Scroll down and click Advanced &gt; Content Settings &gt; Pop up and redirects &gt; Toggle On Blocked
<br />
<br />3. Edge
<br />Open Edge &gt; Click 3 horizontal dots at the top &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Toggle OFF Block pop ups
<br />
<br />This may be due to Malware also. You should run Malware Bytes scan to get rid of this

<br />Try running these programs:

            <p>hello Cowell,</p>
<p>There are two types of Windows licence.</p>
<p>1. Retail (which means you buy the product in a box from a retailer.</p>
<p>2. OEM (Original Equipment manufacture) which means windows&nbsp; comes pre-installed on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have type 1 (Retail) you can install it on your shiney new computer. When you activate you&nbsp;may be told that the product key is already in use. Whether this happens or not will depend upon how long it has been since you last activated your copy of
 Windows. If you have a retail copy and you are informed (when activating over the internet) by the automated activation line that your product key is already in use you simply use the 'telephone' option instead. See this link from my website:
<a href="http://vistasupport.mvps.org/product_key_already_in_use.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://vistasupport.mvps.org/product_key_already_in_use.htm</a></p>
<p>If you have type 2 (OEM) then you will not be able to re-install windows on your new computer as the copy will be tied to your old computer.</p>

 to call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically in effect "deactivate" the license for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed

<p>As a workaround you could try extracting the favicons to a folder on the harddrive and then assign them manually to their relevant shortcuts via the shortcut properties. There are probably other apps which can extract favicons from web links but AM-Deadlink
 and FavOrg are two utilities that have that as an option.</p>

            Hello MeirWeiss, <br />
<br />
<span>Because of the age of the post you replied to, I would suggest that you post your question in the Microsoft Answer’s Forum with as much detailed information about your issue as
 possible which will create a new thread. 
<p><span>Your computer and application configuration is unlikely to be the same as that of the original poster. Posting this way means you may not get as good a response as you would if you started a new
 question. </span></p>
<p><br />
<span>Please take the time to create a separate thread and post your problem/question so that we may provide you with the attention you deserve.</span>
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

<h3> zacbro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add music at all with the Photos video editor.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I like making music videos for YouTube where I put music over a still image. I used to use Windows Movie Maker for this, but since I have a new laptop, and since Movie Maker has been discontinued, I tried to use the video editor within the Photos app.
 However, whenever I try to add my music to the photo it just... won't let me. I'll hit "music" and even when using one of the default songs there's no button to confirm or cancel my selection. I'm at a loss for words. Help!</p>

            OK, then Reset the Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then reinstall it from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have broader performance issues go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Bitlocker not working</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to windows 10 before that I encrypted one of my drives on windows 7. But works on windows 10. Now it'll not open up bitlocker. Even control panel cannot find it. I did sfc /scannow and did nothing. And that drive has important things. Thanks if
 anyone can find a fix that because I searched everywhere.</p>

    <title>CS GO FPS drops after Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zuzuzuko  say:</h3>
<h2>            CS GO FPS drops after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>So, after a recent Windows 10 update (somewhere around 15th of September), gaming became worse. Especially CS GO. A lot of users experiencing massive FPS drops (From 250-300 down to 40 or so). It's not the Xbox DVR problem as it gets your FPS capped at 30.
 Also it seems like FPS problems increased in such games as Overwatch. Before the update it was all fine. Even tried reinstalling Windows, did not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also thought that it might be some problems with AMD Crimson software, but then found out that Nvidia users are also experiencing such problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else having such problem and any ideas how to fix this? Or it is something that Microsoft should look in to? Or it's some 3rd party developer problem?</p>
<p>

            Hi charlesadams5,
<br />
<br />A mouse lagging and freezing can indicate that your system is overly busy in the background
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />Leave that window open and monitor if CPU, RAM or Hard drive is at 100% when this lagging happens . . .

<p>My disk was at 100%, but now it's at like 1-10% it seems normal now but my mouse is still acting up like everything works fine until I move my mouse and then it seems fine then it lags for about 2-3 seconds it's not a real big deal. It gets on my nerves
 I still can play games on it all good and dandy, but if I touch my mouse out of a game lag hell begins for ~3 seconds then comes back after 2. I have updated, uninstalled, task manager, and device managered it, with no results. I really don't want to reset
 my laptop to factory 1 It will delete my apps, and 2 The annoying black bars at resolution 1080 and lower will return. To be quite honest I have been just thinking about just getting a new laptop, but there so expensive ( at least the one I'm looking at. (Not
 mac or Alienware)).&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) Bitdefender is my current anti-virus app and the subscription is current.&nbsp; Although I did have to uninstall/re-install it to get the upgrade.&nbsp; Bitdefender is having a problem as well.&nbsp; Fullscans abort without much info about the error there too.</p>
<p>2) I don't think so.&nbsp; the company I work for went through a serious down sizing and I purchased this machine from them.&nbsp; They did something to "wipe it clean" so there was no proprietary info on it.</p>
<p>3) Once again, I don't think so.&nbsp; The original bitdefender worked fine for me.</p>

Methinks you'd better get that squared away first. There is a very good chance that you are seeing the effects of a hijackware infection!</p>
<p>NB: If you had no anti-virus application installed or the subscription had expired *when the machine first got infected* and/or your subscription has since expired and/or the machine's not been kept fully-patched at Windows Update, don't waste your time
 with any of the below: Format &amp; reinstall Windows.&nbsp; A Repair Install will NOT help!</p>

<p>If these procedures look too complex - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the computer to a local, reputable and independent (i.e., not BigBoxStoreUSA or Geek Squad) computer repair shop.</p>

<p>BTW I've been in the software business quite a while (OS and file systems developer).&nbsp; Longer than I care to admit;)</p>
<p>The machine was never without anit-virus protection.&nbsp; Although, one virus did get through bitdefender and I did run MSRT manually.&nbsp; This was around the time that I tried to upgrade to the latest bitdefender.&nbsp; (But, to be honest, I don't remember all the
 details anymore.)</p>
<p>I've been working with bitdefender for a while to try to fix the problem with the fullscan, although the problem does come and go.&nbsp; At any rate I will try the steps you suggest.&nbsp; However, I have one question...&nbsp; What operation is being denied access?&nbsp; And
 to what object or service?&nbsp; (OK... Maybe I had 2 questions.)</p>

<blockquote>What operation is being denied access?&nbsp; And to what object or service?</blockquote>
<p>I'm surprised to see&nbsp;someone who's "been in the software business quite a while" asking such questions.</p>
<p>Windows Update&nbsp;needs to change some things but it's being denied access to the system (i.e., Registry) to do so. And chances are that the hijackware's doing the denying.</p>

<p>I'm surprised I have to explain this, but, any piece of software can say "access denied".&nbsp; To be useful a log message should include both the operation being attempted and the object being operated on.&nbsp; For example, if an app tries to open/read a file to
 which&nbsp;it, (really the user running&nbsp;the app), doesn't have acces to, it would be nice to see a log message to the effect:&nbsp; "Cannot open file &lt;full pathname to the file&gt; for read access: &nbsp;access denied".&nbsp;&nbsp; Without that, someone (say a linux/unix developer) with
 no inside knowledge of what this security update is actually doing, can have a clue as to what is actually going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any rate, thanks for the info about update trying to modify the registry.&nbsp; I will pursue that further.</p>

You're welcome &amp; thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>If the behavior is due to an infection, any Registry changes you make will be "undone" upon reboot. Such is the nature of the beast.</p>

<h2>            Task Scheduler - what action will start windows speech recognition</h2>
                    Right now I have a task created on task scheduler. I have the action:<br />
<br />
Start a program: C:\Windows\Speech\Common\sapisvr.exe<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it won't start windows speech recognition like I want. Also, I have tried:
<br />
<br />
Start a program: control name/ Microsoft.SpeechRecognition<br />
<br />
But that didn't work either. Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<br />
Start a program: %windir%\Speech\Common\sapisvr.exe -SpeechUX<br />
<br />
%windir%\Speech\Common\sapisvr.exe will be in the Program/script box, and -SpeechUX will be in the Add arguments box.<br />

<h2>            Some videos purchased from Xbox Video store won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play on Windows 8.1 RT  </h2>
                    
<em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Reposting this question in the Xbox forum per guidance from Microsoft support engineer from the Microsoft Answers Windows forum</span></em>
<div>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1 RT</p>
<p>In the Xbox Video App on Windows 8, the My Movies section shows three movies bought from the Microsoft Xbox Video store. Two of these video play OK on Windows RT 8.1. One particular video doesn't allow me to play. There is no option to 'play' the movie&nbsp;but
 I can play the trailer or I can click on the buy option. When I click on the buy option, it shows that I have already purchased the SD version and it says that 'content is already available in your collection'. However, I can't access it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem does not exist in a separate PC running full Windows 8 (not 8.1) where all three videos appear in the My Movies section and play OK. All three movies also play OK on the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to remember that the problem movie played OK on Windows 8 RT which suggest to me that this could be an 8.1 bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how to fix this?</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;Famgol,<br /><br />Can you refresh your purchase history on the Windows 8 RT? This may resolve the issue you are seeing. To do that, follow the steps listed.<br /><br />- Open Xbox Video on your Windows 8 RT&nbsp;<br />- Go to the Settings menu and select Preferences<br />- Under Purchases, select Restore</p>
<p>If the option to restore your purchases is not listed, please make sure you are signed into Xbox Video.<br /><br />Let us know if that helps! &nbsp;</p>

            Hi AshwaniYadav2 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming this is Blue screen error. If not, let me know. If yes, 
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h3> sillyrocketeer5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problemas mando Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Buenas.</p>

<p>Compré hace cosa de 2 meses un mando de Xbox One para mi PC. Al poco tiempo de uso, la tecla B del mando en algunas ocasiones se queda bloqueada lo que impide jugar con normalidad.</p>

<p>He querido pedir por garantía que me lo reparen, pero al querer registrar el producto, resulta que el número de serie que tiene el mando es demasiado largo y me sobrarían 3 números, lo cual me impide registrar el producto para gestionar la garantía.</p>

<p>¿Alguien podría ayudarme a solucionar esto?</p>

<p>Saludos.</p>

<p>Gracias por responder.</p>
<p>Antes de decidirme a postear en el foro, he intentado llamar al número que indica la web de Xbox One sin ningún resultado, ya que comunica siempre. Claro está, he llamado en los horarios en los cuales se supone que están disponibles.</p>
<p>También hay un apartado desde el cual podría mantener una conversación mediante un chat con un técnico o similar, pero tampoco soy capaz de poder chatear con alguien. Para empezar a chatear me piden datos como códigos de erros los cuales ignoro completamente.
 Además, también hay posibilidad de pedir que te llamen ellos, pero me termina pasando lo mismo. Me piden que introduzca el código de error y desconozco cual será.</p>

<p>En el Centro de Servicio en Línea lo primero que tienes que hacer es registrar la consola seleccionando "Registrar un dispositivo", el número de serie de la consola se compone de 12 dígitos, el del mando son 14 dígitos. Viene localizado por detrás abajo
 del código de barras pero, el número de serie de mando tienes que ingresarlo en "Reemplazar un accesorio", sin embargo, lo ingresarás hasta después de seleccionar la One&gt; Dar en Continuar&gt; Selecciona Mando&gt; Ingresas el número de serie del mando.</p>
