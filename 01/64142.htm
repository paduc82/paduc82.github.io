    <title>Error Code 8B05000F Update Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error Code 8B05000F Update Error </h2>
                    <p>Getting this error when I try to update my console. This is the third time this has happened(last 3 updates) Error seems to always occur during verification stage. I cannot find this specific error code online so I don't know whats causing it. The only solution that works is to keep trying to update the console until its successful. The first time this happened to me I did a hard reset on my Xbox one which did not work and left me in the initial setup screen that you cant leave until you install the update( which kept failing) so my console was effectively bricked until eventually I successfully updated it a few days later. The second time I did not perform a hard reset was able to successfully update the console after a few days. </p>

<h2>            Getting Windows Explorer to recognize files with unusual extensions.</h2>
                    Since I moved to Windows Vista, I find that W/E does not recognize certain types of files generated by specialist programs.&nbsp; As an example, these include .bzm files from the CDV Blitzkrieg Map Editor, and .lua files from the SciTE XML editor.&nbsp; How can
 I get these files and others to be recognized?

            I just went through W/E again, looking for something that I did not try.&nbsp; I clicked a few things&nbsp;and when I next checked the files were there on display.&nbsp; I think it was either W-E/View/Refresh or W-E/Edit/Select All.<br />
<br />
Now I'll have to generate some new files to see if they show up.

    <title>Finer points of Windows Media Center operation in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rldled  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finer points of Windows Media Center operation in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have ordered Windows 7 and, if anyone knows, I would like some answers about the finer points of Media Center in this version while I wait for it to arrive.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Windows XP, I found that I had to be physically logged in as a user (not just at the user selection screen) in order for Media Center to record any scheduled programs.&nbsp; Has this been corrected in 7?&nbsp; This was a particular issue with automatic updates, which
 would force a reboot and I would miss shows.<br />
<br />
<br />
I prefer to use the power saving modes (standby/hibernate) as much as possible when my computer is not needed.&nbsp; My computer is on a different floor of the house from my media center extender.&nbsp; While it typically only took a few moments to come to life, it usually
 waited a very long time before reentering sleep mode.&nbsp; I wonder if Windows 7 is smarter?&nbsp; Can it see that the extender is not a real person and return to sleep quicker if no actual inputs are active?&nbsp; Also, sometimes XP would get confused and think there was
 still an extender 'user' connected even when the xbox was off, in which case it would not sleep at all.&nbsp; Has this been addressed?<br />
<br />
With the Xbox the only way to watch certain file types was to use the video menu, not Media Center, and the pc would often go to sleep right in the middle of a movie.&nbsp; Has this been fixed?</p>
<p>I have Verizion FIOS coming to my neighborhood soon.&nbsp; Is there a native way to connect media center, or is it required to use the 'cable box ir blaster' method?</p>
<p>Finally, there are a number of newer TVs with internet capapbility built (Netflix, Youtube, etc.), do any of these have extender functionality as well?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!!!<br />

            Hi rldled,<br />
<br />
You can customize your Power Options to meet your need.&nbsp; You can put your computer to sleep faster and change Power Options so LAN activities will not wake your computer.<br />
<br />
<p>After clicking on the <strong>Power Options</strong> icon, you're asked to <strong>
Select a Power Plan</strong> .</p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fblog.enterpriseitplanet.com%2fgreen%2fblog%2fblogpost_img%2fWindows+7+Power+Settings.jpg" />
</span></p>
<p>There are two options that are immediately available: <strong>Balanced</strong> (the default) and
<strong>Power saver</strong> . Balanced turns off the display after 10 minutes of inactivity and puts your computer into sleep mode after 30 minutes. Power saver halves those times to 5 minutes and 15 minutes respectively.</p>
<p>More proof that Microsoft is making you work at disabling power management options, users will have to open
<strong>Show additional plans</strong> to display a third, <strong>High performance</strong> profile that shuts off the display after 15 minutes but never enters sleep mode.</p>
<p>Apart from that, you can create your own custom power plan by selecting the link on the left or editing an existing plan and tweaking the advanced settings to your liking, including whether to prompt for a password when your computer wakes and assign a power
 setting (like sleep or shutdown) to the power button.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fblog.enterpriseitplanet.com%2fgreen%2fblog%2fblogpost_img%2fWindows+7+Power+Settings+Advanced.jpg" />
</span></p>
Depend on each computer, Power Options might be slightly different.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,

    <title>No internet connection after upgrade to Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stu_cj  say:</h3>
<h2>            No internet connection after upgrade to Win7</h2>
                    This seems to be quite common :<br />
After doing an upgrade to Win7 I have no internet connection (Ethernet card / via homeplug / router ). I ran the Diagnostic tool and that was no help at all (basically it said......"sorry no idea mate" ). Fortunately I have learned that it's best to have dual-boot
 option back to XP for when things inevitably go wrong and once booting that I could connect no problem at all and search for an answer myself. The concensus was to diasble the network card and then re-enable it.&nbsp; Bingo...it works (every time I start Win7).
 Now, OK, I can do this each and every time no problem and it works...but should I have to ? It IS rather annoying and the idea of changing to Win7 was to have a "less annoying" life than Vista.&nbsp; I have no anti-virus or security running (Win7 told me to uninstall
 what I had and I haven't decided which one to go for yet as I need to find one that works). I have also checked to see if my card driver is up-to-date and apparently it is.<br />
I would be less concerned if it wasnt for the fact that this seems so common that I could find a work-around within 5 minutes.<br />
Does anyone have a more permanent solution or will I have to keep doing this every time? Thanks.

<h3> mm1666  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;HotFixInstaller&#34; error&#58;Using Windows XP SP3. The error code is 0xe06d7363.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: "HotFixInstaller" error:Using Windows XP SP3</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should say at the outset that I'm a "novice" when it comes to using personal computers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About&nbsp;3 weeks ago when I tried to install MS Updates KB2633880 and KB890830 I received a "HotFixInstaller" error. The error code is 0xe06d7363.&nbsp; I've tried it several times since then and the same error is returned and I continue to receive notifications
 that the same Updates are available.</p>
<p>One person told me that I need to do a "clean install."&nbsp; Another person said that I should do a "Windows Repair."&nbsp; But I don't know what the proper procedure is to &nbsp;solve this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions will be greatly appeciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>890830 is an ongoing update,its the malicous software removal utility,try downloading</p>
<p>&amp; installing that yourself.The other is .NET 2.0 update,however thier is a 2.0 hotfix</p>
<p>kb913047,maybe install it first (if it lets you).</p>
<p>Also,yes a clean install might get you past these w/o a problem,but at SP3,thats alot of</p>
<p>work,a repair (boot to xp cd),means almost starting over also,&amp; IE8 needs to be uninstalled</p>
<p>1st,as does WMP 11,if thats installed.</p>

<h2>            signing in to two accounts at once</h2>
                    I just updated from skype classic to skype&nbsp;Skype version 8.29.0.50 yesterday. With skype classic&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;was able to be signed in to 2 different&nbsp;accounts at once. When I updated I read to add &nbsp;--secondary and when
 I tested it after the update it worked. Today when I need to be signed in to both for work. it is not working. If anyone has any tips I would be grateful&nbsp;I have to use both accounts both are for work one is for internal communications&nbsp;the other is for external
 that we all take turns monitoring. I was the first to update to skype 8 so now I need to figure this out. For the time I am using my phone and computer but that is far from ideal.&nbsp;

<p>Screen is getting distorted after the update. I read blogs and came to know something wrong with graphics driver.</p>
<p>in detail I can say.screen is having many dots, hyphens and when you move mouse, it is used to change position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I have uninstalled Intel display driver&nbsp;Intel Graphics 4600 from control panel, it is working fine now.</p>
<p>The issue now is, windows 10 is keep checking for updates and automatically installs intel display driver. also after removing this driver, few feature s like nightlight, screen resolution change are not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me with right direction?</p>

<h2>            Darmowy gold po założeniu konta &#40;problem&#47;pytanie&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Witam !</p>

<p>Czy po założeniu konta w xbox live , konto gold automatycznie się aktywuje ? (Chodzi mi o to , że pierwsze 3 konta założone na jednym xboxie mają darmowy miesiąc próbny golda) Czy trzeba go jakoś aktywować (Jest to moje TRZECIE założone konto). I czy liczą
 się do tego też konta odzyskane z innych xboxów "Pobierz profil" ?</p>

<p>Sam założyłem 3 konta , darmowego golda dostałem na dwóch.</p>

<p>Chodzi o to czy jesli jest np. ojciec i syn i ojciec ma gold to czy syn moze grac online na swoim profilu?</p>
<p>W ustawieniach konsoli mozna zorbic konto i ustalic kto jest opiekunem ale nie wiem czy to to samo.</p>

<p>W niektóre gry może grać online jednocześnie kilka osób na jednym profilu z goldem, tzn. logujesz się na koncie na którym jest gold, a reszta loguje się jako goście.</p>

<p>Hi Paths,</p>
<p>It looks like you're trying to get <span>
XP Mode configured, which will install a virtual machine for you to run&nbsp;your legacy programs in.&nbsp; This feature is available in Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise versions - so your good in that aspect.
</span></p>
<p><span>You are getting that error message becasue you&nbsp;</span><span>don't have
 the chip installed&nbsp;for Hardware Assisted Virtualization Technology - and that's alright; you don't need it anymore.&nbsp; Click this link
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</a>&nbsp;and select your edition and language.&nbsp; Then scroll down to Step 3.&nbsp; You need to Download and Run the third item called
<strong>Windows XP Mode Update</strong>. This update will remove the requirement that you have the chip mentioned above.</p>
<p>That should do the trick.</p>

<h2>            What are some MODERN, external fax modems &#40;USB 2.0 or higher&#41; to use with Windows 10, 64 bit and why am I havine difficulty finding newer ones&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a Dell Alienware desktop gaming computer. I'm trying to find a state-of-the-art external fax modem (USB) to use for my faxing yet I can't find anything that is NOT several years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any links to modems that are up-to-date that are compatible with Windows 10, 64 bit? I'm looking for one recently manufactured.</p>

<p>No. There are modems out there that are compatible with Windows 10 that are, in fact dinosaurs. My current external USB modem from HP is over 8 years old and works with Windows 10 without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it happens, I recently purchased the US Robotics modem you linked to (true story) from Dell and just returned it because I specifically asked the representative if it was USB 2.0 and she told me yes. When the modem arrived, it was NOT USB 2.0 and its
 accompanying software was from 2007!!! (not the drivers but fax software that came with it). I couldn't run that software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my question states, I am looking for the newest external fax modems, USB 2.0 and I can not find them. Why? Are people not using fax modems anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new Alienware desktop is fast and I want a modem that has NEW technology. But I can't find them.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use win10. After restart or wake up from hibernation, sometimes the keyboard repeat rate is reset to some relatively slow value, and I have to manually change it back at Control&nbsp;Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens randomly (or at least I haven't found any correlation with other things). Could anyone help?</p>

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.

<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />

<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

            I see a couple upgrades for this model that might be helpful.
<br />
<br />BIOS Update from February 2018:
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER04771660M/1/Alienware_15R2_17R3_1.4.4.EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER04771660M/1/Al...</a>
<br />
<br />Touchpad driver update from May 2018:
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER04768795M/4/Dell-Touchpad-Driver_YYK15_WIN_19.2.17.64_A10_02.EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER04768795M/4/De...</a>
<br />
<br />These updates can often resolve stability issues introduced with a new version of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />When Microsoft starts preparing for a new release, it goes through a process called refactoring. It seems this is introducing some significant code changes that breaks certain protocols and API's required by older apps and drivers. Considering the Windows Driver Model has not changed much in its near 30 year history not mention the application programming interfaces such as Win32, this might be culprit.

<h3> vanamali vanam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Drive and migration to SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a dell laptop with Windows 7 OEM version. Later I upgraded it to windows 8 beta version (student free upgrade) and then followed by a windows 8.1 version from store .Now I am trying to migrate the windows partition to SSD without reinstalling. I
 have a few questions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1. My question is what does my recovery drive hold. A backup for version 7 or is the recovery drive also updated during the OS upgradation.There are 3 partitions in my case 1. (102 MB OEM partition unnamed) 2. RECOVERY (19.53 GB NTFS) 2. OS (344 GB NTFS)</p>
<p>2. I am trying to delete the recovery drive but the delete drive option is greyed out. I also tried the diskpart method to unlock the drive and then delete. even that did not enable the deletion of the drive ?</p>
<p>3. what is 102 MB OEM partition doing. If I only do a partition copy of C drive of 344 gb to ssd? will that work? Will i be able to boot from my ssd after this migration process or do i have to partition copy of 102MB partition and RECOVERY and OS ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding the screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. </p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Recovery drive hold a backup for Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The 102 MB volume is labeled as System Reserved with NTFS file system, and System, Active, Primary partition attribute with no drive letter in Disk Management. The 102 MB system partition is used primarily as BitLocker partition for BitLocker encryption.
 Additionally, it also holds the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) and boot files with boot manager for booting up the computer for troubleshooting when there is no Windows installation DVD disc on hand. You can just copy the system drive to SSD in order
 to use SSD as a system disk.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently did this on a HP, and I just created an image of the OS(C:) to an external hard drive, put the SSD in the laptop, and Recovered the image to the SSD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booted first try, but this was Win 7...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did this on a Compaq Desktop after upgrading 7 to 8...</p>
<p>I had to do a Startup Repair to get it to boot the first time, but after that... no problem..</p>
<p>You might have better luck if you were to image both the 102MB and the OS(C:)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Recover 102MB to the SSD at it's actual size... don't fit to disk...</p>
<p>Then Recover the OS(C:) to the remaining partition...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Acronis TruImage PlusPack to do this... The newer versions are called TrueImage Premium...</p>
<p>You want to do this with a bootable CD, and Acronis comes on one.</p>
<p>There are other programs that may be able to do this, But I can't vouch for them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of free imaging programs, but they don't all work the same. It can be difficult to determine which features come on the paid version that are not included with the free version..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your SSD manufacturer may have a free imaging or cloning program to do this with it's own SSD's.</p>

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />Look on your Start Menu for a large tile for the Camera App
<br />
<br />If you don't see that:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button at the bottom left of your screen, then just type camera and hit Enter
<br />
<br />The Camera App should open
<br />
<br />With that you can take photos and also video . .

<p>is it possible to know details and which rules?</p>

</p><p>it looks like quite a problem from microsoft as the product is global and can be also exported for those who will move around and live in china for a limited time but still wants to use microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>are then software packages foreseen once the product is moved? it is not part of the declaration in the console once is purchased in one country either.</p>

<br />Install Skype then check if its working again.
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.30 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi Aleks,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd like to help with your issue, though I can't see the image as it gives me the following error:
<br />
<br />{"Message":"The request is invalid."}
<br />
<br />Can you try to upload your image again or upload it to a third-party image hosting site?
<br />
<br />Thanks.

            Aleks,<br /><br />Thank you, I can see it now. I can’t seem to pinpoint the particular issue — it could be many things, graphics processor artifacting, maybe needing to update your EFI or BIOS firmware. If it happens for a few seconds it could be the Windows Boot Manager under that artifacting, prompting you to choose an OS or its respective options. You might want to look into those two and see if you can get this issue resolved.

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </span>
</strong></a>command to repair any component store corruption, restart the PC afterwards, and try the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

You may need to repeat doing a System
 Restore until you find a older restore point that may work. <br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.
