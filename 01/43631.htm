<h2>            Console Freezes &#40;Tried Wizard&#41; and Looking for Advice</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>It feels like I'm in an episode of House MD. Allow me to explain:</p>
<p>For about four years, my vanilla xbox 360 has served me faithfully. I would call myself a casual gamer, but I've put some good hours on it. About three weeks ago, the console started freezing after about 3-7 minutes of use. This behaviour has been consistent
 since then and has the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>the console freezes regardless of task:&nbsp;playing a game,&nbsp;installing an update;&nbsp;watching a video; or even just&nbsp;sitting on the dashboard;
</li><li>the power brick's light is green, the console's lights are green, and the controller's light is green when it freezes;
</li><li>the console is unresponsive to controller input - no dashboard access, no power off, no buttons or joystick input works;
</li><li>the console's hardware appears to respond still: the tray opens on push, and powers down when I press the power button.
</li></ul>
<p>I followed the Console Freeze wizard, as recommended on this site:</p>
<ul>
<li>moving the console and power brick on to the floor in open space - no change in behaviour;
</li><li>clearing the cache (when I was able to get to it before it freezing) - no change in behaviour;
</li><li>removing the hard drive appears to resolve this issue. </li></ul>
<p>Slam dunk. The hard drive was faulty, so I purchased a new hard drive for the Xbox and installed it. After about 5 minutes, the console froze. Sigh. Maybe it was a dud drive, so to check that over, I gave both my "faulty" hard drive and my new hard drive
 to my buddy who also owns a vanilla xbox. He played with both hard drives for over an hour without issue. Not the hard drive, I guess. Bad wizard!</p>
<p>So now I'm thinking that my console's definitely got something wrong with it. It was far past warranty, and would cost me $130 + tax and shipping to get it refurbed. So I craigslisted an Xbox for $70 - I had the cables and everything, and found a seller
 that had the console in "excellent condition" but didn't have the cables or power adapter (I didn't ask why). No worries - it came with a controller and Fifa 12. Not bad. So I plugged the new system in and ... exact same behaviour. Now, I know it's craigslist
 and all but I think it's really unlikely that two completely different Xboxes can exhibit the same issues ... unless they have common parts. Which leads me to my current theory.</p>
<p>The only common part between these two machines is the 175W power adapter. I tried to borrow my buddy's but apparently the vanilla Xboxes went through minor revisions because his is 150W and has a different jack that is incompatible with (both of) mine :S
 So I can't verify that it's the power adapter at this time.</p>
<p>So I'm appealing to the forums now asking for help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I missing something in my assessment? </li><li>Is there some way through Microsoft to get the the power adapter replaced? I only see repair forms for the console itself and I don't feel that $130 plus tax is a good price for just a refurbished power brick.
</li></ul>
<div>All advice appreciated - thanks in advance.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So your console started freezing about three weeks ago, was this around the time the latest system update was released?</p>
<p>Could you try deleting the system update and re- updating your console manually using a USB flash drive as described in the following thread please.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/7/t/166045.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../166045.aspx</a></p>
<p>I can't guarantee it will fix your issue but it's worth a shot.</p>
To delete the system update Locate your hard drive in the storage section on your console Press LB,RB,X,LB,RB,X Follow the prompt to delete the system update

<p>@v G O R D O N v:</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply; I know that "buy a new console" is a likely last resort. I'm appealing to the forum first to see if the problem can be resolved without needing to buy a completely new system. I did, however, test both machines without the ethernet
 cable plugged in - no change in behaviour. The internet connection is very likely not related to this problem.</p>
<p>@ThingOnAString:</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice. I uninstalled the system update following your instructions. I then restarted the console, declined the update request, cleared the cache and shut down the console. Then I downloaded the update, unzipped it to a USB stick, and
 plugged it into the front port of the XBox. When I booted it up, I was prompted to install the update. After doing so, I restarted the console.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the machine's behaviour has not changed. In fact, as I write this, I'm looking at a frozen picture of the Bungie splash intro that plays when I start up Halo Reach.</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>It seems strange that two consoles with separate hard drives exhibit the same behaviour. Do you use a power surge protector at all? If so try connecting the console power pack directly to a mains outlet bypassing the power surge protector. It is also worth
 trying a different power outlet just in case that is faulty and not the console.</p>
<p>As you state the problem is gone once you remove the hard drive it leads to one conclusion, it's the hard drive but you tried another hard drive and that was the same so that kind of throws that theory out the window maybe.</p>
<p>It seems you've done a pretty good job of testing things, may I suggest you backup your profiles etc and format the drive to see if that helps any.</p>

<p>Thanks again for replying with your suggestions. I have a few testing updates, and admit that I have to replace some presumptions I'd made in earlier testing.</p>
<p>First, I tried moving the power adapter to a different power outlet, away from the power bar-connected tv set up. Both Xboxes continued to freeze after 5-10 minutes of use.</p>
<p>Then I managed to find another 175W power adapter. I really thought this would be the solution, but even the different power adapter in its own plug did not resolve the problem: both consoles continue to freeze after 5-10 minutes of use.</p>
<p>I reviewed Gordon's advice and my own testing and swore that unplugging the ethernet cable did nothing, but at this point I was out of options. But when I unplugged the ethernet connection and rebooted the machine and wasn't signed into XBox Live, I was
 able to play the Xbox for over 30 minutes continuously! This worked for both machines. And like clockwork, within 5-10 minutes of plugging in the ethernet connection, the console freezes.</p>
<p>This sounds consistent so far, but didn't address why removing the hard drive solved the problem. So I went back to that. I tested it three times on each machine, with no hard drive installed, skipping the sign in and, with the ethernet cable plugged in,
 started up Gears of War 3, Dark Souls and Reach. Every time, both consoles froze. So I have to update my presumption that removing the hard drive solved the problem. Maybe it lasted a few minutes longer the first time, leading me to believe it worked.</p>
<p>So where I'm at now is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>no ethernet cable plugged in: console works fine, I can play each of them for 30+ minutes, regardless of hard drive or power adapter.
</li><li>ethernet cable plugged in: console freezes after 5-10 minutes of being plugged in, regardless of whether it started that way or not (ie. I plugged it in after playing for a bit and signed in).
</li></ul>
<p>I've been able to quickly power on the console with the ethernet cable in, download and install updates quickly, power off, unplug the cable and start it up again with no problems. So it seems that after a certain period, having the ethernet connection is
 bad. But it takes a few minutes for that to happen. I'm going to bring my console(s) over to a friend's house to test whether it's my router or not. But I doubt it, given how many devices my router currently serves just fine at home.</p>
<p>If I find out that, even at my friend's house, having an internet connected Xbox causes it to freeze, what should I do? Because at that point, I'd be willing to bet it's firmware or software, which means that Microsoft is preventing me from using a service
 that I'm paying them for.</p>

<p>I don't think you need a new console, I have the original Pro version and just updated to the lastest firmware and it works without issue, so I would eliminate hardware as being the cause. Make sure it's properly ventilated, give it space to breathe. I think
 it's profile or network related.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would check the Active Downloads queue (hit Xbox button on controller, go to Marketplace tab and select Active Downloads), make sure nothing is being downloaded or queue'd up. I would also check your HDD and see how much space you have left, maybe try
 deleting some demos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Then go to Network Settings, select Wired or Wireless, then execute the "Test XBOX live Connection".<br />
This will answer any network issues.</p>
<p><br />
If all is ok, log off and create a new silver profile, see if you face any issues at all.<br />
Last but not least, you can try deleting your profile and then recovering it.</p>
<p><br />
Don't delete any of your saves/items or anything. Select profile only.</p>

<br />
Then just recover.</p>
<p>*Not sure what ramifications come if you try this, so no guarantees.</p>

<p>It may be worth a shot at resetting the consoles network settings to the defaults as described in the link below.</p>

<p>Hi! Thank you for your advice! It's comforting to know that there's another Pro out there that isn't having the problems I'm encountering right now. I checked my Marketplace window - no active downloads on my account at this time. I've long since given up
 trying to keep my game saves - both machines' HDDs have been reformatted a few times since I started dealing with this. I reformatted it again, just to be sure. It's got 225GB space left, and no change in behaviour.</p>
<p>I did the network diagnostics as recommended by you and by ThingOnAString. It uncovered an interesting problem - my router's uPnP hadn't been enabled, so I changed the settings on my router and rebooted it. I thought that could definitely have solved the
 problem until 6 minutes into a YouTube video, the box froze.</p>
<p>I followed the next suggestion and started creating a new silver profile. Literally as I was creating the new profile the console froze! Sure, I was taking my time choosing his clothes, but still...</p>
<p>I tried deleting my profile and recovering it as suggested but again, no dice there. The console still freezes after about 5-7 minutes.</p>
<p>@ThingOnAString</p>
<p>I followed your advice and reset the console's network settings to the factory default. It's how I uncovered a potential problem with my router set up, but unfortunately it didn't resolve the problem. When I test the XBOX LIVE connection, it says everything's
 "up".</p>
<p>I gave one of the systems to a friend of mine to test out as his place to see if he's having the same problems. If he doesn't, then it must have to do with my network set up at home. If he has the same problems, then it's likely not network related imo.</p>

<p>So I have an interesting update: my friend called me and told me that the Xbox I gave him ran just fine, even with an ethernet cable plugged in: he played for over 30 minutes without issue. I plan to trade him for the other system to see if the results are
 similar, but right now it indicates a network problem or problem involving the network setup and the XBox. We both use the same cable provider - Shaw Cable - but we have different modems. Mine is a Cisco DCP3825, which is a combination modem and Wi-Fi/4-Port
 Ethernet router.</p>
<p>I've been looking on the interwebs for anyone else with problems with these two devices together, but haven't found anything yet. I'm grateful for all of the suggestions so far. Allow me to summarize the findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>set up: Cisco DCP3825 Modem + Wi-Fi Router, connected to multiple internet capable devices via Wi-Fi and ethernet
</li><li>problem: console freezes after 5-10 minutes of use consistently whenever the ethernet cable is plugged in - when it's not, the console works fine
</li><li>problem appears to be scoped to just my set up - at a friend's house with the same internet provider but different modem, the problem did not occur
</li><li>Xbox Live Connection test results in all checkmarks - Network, Internet, Xbox LIVE, all Live Status markers "Up"
</li><li>IP settings are set to Automatic, DNS settings Automatic, no Alternate MAC Address specified (though when I tried to change it, the Xbox could no longer connect to the network)
</li></ul>
<div>@FH BRoWNtoWN</div>
<div>Thank you for the suggestion! I have reformatted the hard drives multiple times and reset various settings in the machine to their factory defaults, following the Microsoft support guides. I haven't seen any change in behaviour.</div>

<p>Hi Tibbsy,</p>
<p>Assuming your friend doesn't have the same issue with your console at his place is it possible to connect your console directly to your modem bypassing the router.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>the easiest test of course would be to simply not have your console connected to the Internet at all and then see if it still freezes, that would prove it is or isn't a network issue.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Please keep us informed as I am very interested in this and it can be added to my database of solutions for other users.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

                    <p>Hi, have bought my son the linx 1010 as a starter tablet/laptop. As soon as we updated the latest windows version, the above error code for the camera shows and states that the camera is in use by another app....even with no other program running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, if the camera opens on front facing and we then switch to back facing then the code comes. we then turn the camera off and back on, the back camera then works and when we swap to front facing....we get the code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help gratefully received.</p>

            <p>Hi, I wondered if you had found a solution to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting the same error message on my linx 1010 tablet, the only difference is that I cannot use the camera at all as it opens in front camera video mode and when I try to switch to the back camera I get the error message. &nbsp;Switching the camera off and
 then back on makes no difference as it always opens in front camera video mode. &nbsp;The camera was working fine on 4 Feb so I am wondering if a Windows update since that date has triggered this problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would really appreciate hearing whether you have found a solution or not. &nbsp;Many thanks.<br />

            <p>Hello and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I still have a problem.&nbsp; I followed your advice to remove and reinstall the camera driver from Windows Control Panel and used your link to
<strong>Using Device manager to uninstall devices and driver packages </strong>to do this.&nbsp;I uninstalled the IntelR AV stream camera which I assumed was the "camera driver" but now I don't know how to reinstall it!&nbsp; In my ignorance I had assumed that this would
 remove the Windows camera app which I did know how to reinstall but the Windows camera app still shows as installed and now gives the error message "we cannot find your camera".&nbsp; Are you able to give me further advice on how to proceed.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon restarting the PC after uninstalling the device driver, the camera driver should automatically reinstall itself. If not, we suggest that you scan for hardware changes in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Access <strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager </strong>by pressing the<strong> Windows key + X</strong>, and then select
<strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager</strong>, click on the <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong> icon

            <p>Hello Patricia</p>
<p>I have scanned for hardware changes in Device Manager.&nbsp; Nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before following Roan's suggestion to remove the camera driver I had Intel AV Stream camera showing under Imaging Devices in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation now is that I do not have the folder Imaging Devices showing at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is how do I get back the Intel AV Stream camera driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope someone can help me.</p>
<p>

            You may download the Intel AV Stream Camera driver specifically for your device from the manufacturer's website.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There is no real issue as many Apps need to use your location to properly function.<br />
<br />
Location just means your general area such as city or zip code (in USA).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>There isn’t an option to switch automatically between power plans when the laptop is plugged in or running on battery power.<br />
The best option would be select a balanced power plan which offers full performance and display brightness when you need it, but conserves power when the computer is idle.</span></p>

    <title>Voice Recording Too Fast - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgetborton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Voice Recording Too Fast</h2>
                    When I first upgraded to Win10 a few days ago everything worked OK.&nbsp; Suddenly today Cortana wouldn't respond so I started looking.&nbsp; When I record a voice test on Skype and then play it back it is going at least 2x or maybe more - worse than the Chipmunks.&nbsp;
 I tried the same thing using the Windows Media encoder and get the same result.&nbsp; Microphone is on a Logitech C310 Webcam.&nbsp; Sound card is a Soundblaster Audigy FX.&nbsp; I don't know of any changes made unless a Win10 update came through and am at a loss to figure
 out why it suddenly did this.

            <p>I had updated the drivers already.&nbsp; I have found if I uninstall my webcam and my soundcard and reboot I can usually get it to work.&nbsp; And sometimes it works on an initial startup.&nbsp; It is not consistent which is unfortunate.&nbsp; Also I have found when it doesn't
 work Cortana doesn't pick up anything I say, so if I start up and Cortana doesn't pick up I know I have to go through the above procedure.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting could not find any problems.&nbsp; When I can find a wired mic that I can hook to my soundcard directly I will see if that solves the problem.</p>

    <title>Retrieving Password for Skype on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjaak08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Retrieving Password for Skype on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This is ridiculous! I am logged into my Skype on my Android phone and on my IPad.</p>
<p>I recently logged out of Skype on my PC. Now I can no longer log in.</p>
<p>I have gone through the useless password reset option numerous times.</p>
<p>Each time it wants to use the email address I originally used to set up Skype.</p>
<p>This Email address no longer exists and has been updated on my profile years ago.</p>
<p>When checking on my IPad I find this old email is still shown under "These contact details can be used to find you on Skype", in addition to my mobile nr. I can update mobile nr, but cannot update or delete the old Email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to contact the Skype Customer Care Centre (except for a commercial third party outfit), either from mmy PC (I am not logged into Skype there) or my IPAD or Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to top up my account by payment from my CC. Thi sis promptly shown on the account I am logged in.</p>
<p>But still there is no way to retrieve or reset my password, or just log into my Skype account on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it that Microsoft always seem to turn a very easy to use piece of software into a useless piece of crap.</p>
<p>They seem happy to take payments, but refuse to offer any form of assistance, except through some unmonitored email message to which you can not respond. Who can help?</p>

<p>Thanks Danida_U. </p>
<p>Glad to finally get a response from a person rather than from an unmonitored email address.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can sort this for me. If Skype is willing to accept my payments (I topped up my account yesterday, updated balance shown on IPad &amp; phone account), then Skype should also allow me to access my account.</p>
<p>Suspect problem may be related to me recently relocating to another city, therefore having another IP address, which triggers security alarm.</p>

</p><p>No matter what I try, and no matter how accurate I fill in the details, it does not allow access to my account. More frustrating, there is no email or phone number to sort this out, either with Skype or Microsoft. An after a number attempst it locks me out
 altogether, and have to wait 24 hrs for the next attempt. This is absolutely ridiculous!</p>

<p>Four days later. Several more attempt to retrieve Skype Password or gain access to Skype account. No further answers, still no access. What a waste of time. Is there any live person at the other side of the line or am I doomed to forever dealing with one-way

<p>I'm having a similar problem. &nbsp;I created my Skype account years ago (so the recovery questions are hard to answer because I don't recall what State Iived in when I created it or what email address I used at the time). I have Skype &nbsp;open and active on one
 computer (personal) where I can see what email addresses are associated with it and phone numbers, and like Sjaak08 I can add credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I try to change/recover the password to set up the account on a new work computer, it only gives me the option of an old work email and old work phone number (neither of which I have access to anymore) that somehow got associated with the account
 during that job. These are completely different than the email addresses and phone number that show on my account settings on the computer I can access my account on. &nbsp;So I'm stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then to confuse matters I seem to have a separate Microsoft account that I can access, but that doesn't allow me to access any Skype account. &nbsp;Yet when I go to the accounts page, it tells me my Microsoft account is linked to my skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

<h2>            &#34;Your Windows Licence Will Expire Soon&#34;</h2>
                    So, my PC keeps saying this, even after a factory reset, it is some sort of 2009 Toshiba laptop which came with Windows 7 I believe. &nbsp;It was bought used, with Windows 10 upgraded on it, a week or two ago I started getting a message that says "Your Windows
 Licence Will Expire Soon". I click on "Go to settings" and there is no help there whatsoever, all it says is "Change product key". I don't know what id happening. Please help, none of anything that I find can fix this. The edition of windows is Windows 10
 Enterprise if it helps any.

<h2>            Game freezes at the same point</h2>
                    <p>Recently purchased Red Dead Redemption 2 on Xbox One. However ive come across a problem regarding Red Dead Online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I load up to online, I select between a Male or Female character. Once this happens im required to name my character and change there apperance. It freezes everytime roughly around the same point, between putting the name and changing his apperance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i contacted Rockstar Support and went through many troubleshooting methods to try and fix the problem. Such as reinstaling the game, factory resetting my console but using the “keep game save data” option. Unplugging the power box from my xbox and plugging
 it back in. Nothing had fixed the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no other problems with any other games, Story mode also seems to work fine. Does anyone have an explanation for this? Thanks&nbsp;</p>

                    Hi, Yesterday my Xbox asked me to enter my email and password to verify my account for security proofing. Problem is I have been auto logging in for years , I do not know my password and my email is an old one that no longer exists. I can't log in, cannot
 post here under my proper account and cannot seem to find a solution via the forums and Microsoft support. I have filled out a request form but the automated system is telling me I'm not providing enough information to send a password to a new email address..
 I can verify my account via my billing and profile settings. Please can someone help me I've been going round in Microsoft link circles! Thanks Howard

<p>We can't. &nbsp;All you can do is what you have already done. &nbsp;I know. &nbsp;I did this same thing for six months trying to answer all those questions. &nbsp;You will just have to kept at it. &nbsp;You only choice to continue the account verification process. &nbsp;There is no other
 way around it. &nbsp;I know you are wanting a quick fix but there is none. &nbsp;If you ever do gain access. learn this lesson: write down ALL account info...just like I did.</p>

<p>Don't like the sound of that. So basically I've lost my account as I don't know my password and my email doesn't exist. Seems archaic. An account I've had for 7 years. Not good at all. Any idea who else I can contact, is there a support number? Thanks for
 the replies by the way. Appreciate it.</p>

<p>yea , same problem she had. about a year ago she tried to call up and get it sorted but got no where. she could still use live tho. then one day its asked for password and it was game over because her email was no longer live and she didnt know anything
 to renew it. she was like 14 when she made it. (25 now). &nbsp;what i was thinking is if she made a new xbox live account now on her new email, could xbox live add all her data, game save's etc to her new account? just so she can play online now, we have paid for
 a service which we cant use atm :(</p>

<p>I would just sit there and try every password I can think of but I think I've tried so many times its now blocked and I can't unblock it as I don't have a valid email on my account. Infuriating. I wouldn't mind that much but I've spent a fortune on dlc in
 the past few months on injustice and NHL14 HUT. Gutted. Surely there is a way round this......</p>

<p>Step 1.) Don't panic!</p>
<p>Step 2.) contact support. &nbsp;If you live in US or Canada call 1800-4MY-XBOX.</p>
<p>Step 3.) listen to the support professional and do everything that they suggest, they're there to help.</p>
<p>Step 4.) If you get stuck, you might need to get the issue escalated. &nbsp;Keep in mind that you might need to wait about a week to hear back, but if the account is yours, and you do everything that the advocacy team member suggests, he's there to help you too.</p>

<p>I managed to go through to a live chat with an xbox support advisor. He helped me straight away, my case was escalated and I was able to provide them with information directly from my xbox console which validates my account. Hopefully I should hear back
 within the next 24 hours, they contact you directly and the advisor seem to think I will have no problem setting up a new email and validating my account manually. So, phew...... there is light at the end of the tunnel, as suggested above :-) I dont know how
 often this problem occurs but surely it should be a sticky, or at least in an FAQ? Ive been lost for 2 days following links.</p>

    <title>System not running after an update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mienco7  say:</h3>
<h2>            System not running after an update</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
Yesterday (4th Sep 2018) an update was installed on my computer during shutdown. Everything went properly, the installation was not interrupted. Now the system is not loading - Windows 10 logo and a loading circle appear and then nothing happens (I even tried
 to wait for 2 hours). After a hard reset a "system fixing tool" is starting, but it ends with a black screen and a mouse, which can be moved.<br />
I tried booting the system from both DVD and USB, but it also didn't work - a blue screen with a mouse appears.<br />
How can I fix this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

            Thank you for your answer!<br />
<br />
The problem is, that I can't boot into a safe mode. After the 3rd Power ON the Windows logo with a note "Preparing automatic repair" appears, but after that there is a blank black screen with a mouse and nothing more.<br />
I'm not sure if that helps, but I tried to run an USB with linux on it and I chose "Check files integrity" option. There were several errors, they can be seen on the attached photo.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd641830-a830-4d95-a0df-73fdaddd5e9f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd641830-a830-4d95-a0df-73fdaddd5e9f?upload=true" /></a>

            <p>I'm having exactly the same problem here. It seems to be some problem with the child account, I can't even sign in to live.com, Xbox.com or windowsphone.com to check his account settings. It will keep asking for a parent log in whenever I try to access his
 account, and after giving my credentials I get an error message reporting some missing information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my account on windowsphone.com I'm unable to add him as a child in Family space, I will still get the same error messages.</p>

            It turned out that the problem was with the criation of the child account. Not that I could fix it, but have to create another one, but this time actually using "live.com" (or outlook.com) instead of microsoft account with email from other companies. Tried
 using an email from yahoo before, but it appears that when you do this, Microsoft sets your account above a profile based on USA that you are not able to change. So if you are outside USA you will have problems like that, unless you have an american credit
 card in your billing data to be able to authorize your child.

            Same here - I've contacted Microsoft and been told that a new account needs parental permission - this isn't a new account, he's been on it for well over a year. &nbsp;However, I tried anyway and was told my date of birth info is incomplete. &nbsp;It's not.
<div>Microsoft said that the account was registered in US so I can't give permission. It's not and never has been!!</div>
<div>Frankly, Microsoft have been rubbish, for 2 months my son has had no access and is wasting his MS live credit and I'm tearing my hair out. &nbsp;I await their latest gem, and will let you know if it works - I'm dubious. &nbsp;For the record, this is on a PC, then
 a laptop, then a Windows phone - zilch anywhere. &nbsp;I'm truly fed up.</div>

<h2>            Logitech MX Master Mouse utility won&#39;t launch after Creator&#39;s Update</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with my mouse's utility software. It's a Logitech MX Master. The file in question is "logioptions.exe". It won't open. I'm currently running W10 build 15063.138.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the Creator's Update, the utility worked just fine. Since then, it fails to launch. I put the question to Logitech's own support forum and haven't received a response yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software. I ran Windows compatibility troubleshooter, which did nothing. &nbsp;I can use the mouse but I can no longer configure any of the buttons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any takers?</p>

There is a possibility that the mouse drivers need updating. For proper isolation, kindly verify the queries below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried performing a Windows Update?</li><li>Have you tried updating the mouse drivers available from the manufacturer's web site?</li><li>Have you tried checking this article: <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293" title="Click here">How

<p><span>Drivers up to date yes</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So far, I've uninstalled and reinstalled 3 different versions of the manufacturer's "Logitech options" utility:&nbsp;</span><span>6.3.80, 6.440.169 and 6.50.60. In each case I ran Windows compatibility troubleshooter but to no avail. I also booted
 into safe mode and ran the installer there. It actually starts without issue in safe mode, but when I restart with normal boot, it won't launch again.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I opened case with Logitech and I'm waiting for a response</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping that it's their issue and that they have a solution...but after reading through most of the complaints about the same problem on their support forums, no one seems to know how or why it's happening and any of their suggested fixes haven't worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A few of the forum posts have stated that this program failed to launch after they updated to W10 Version 1703. This is also true in my case. Perhaps Logitech needs to do some testing at their end and release a compatible version of the software...or maybe
 you can help</p>

            <p>I have some news about this problem and others that might relate to the <strong>
Creators Update</strong> itself. I now have 3 programs that are malfunctioning. All 3 were working well prior to April 12 (actually, I had updated to build15063 on April 5).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Logitech, there is now a support forum on their site called "LOGITECH OPTIONS NOT WORKING WITH WINDOWS 10 CREATORS UPDATE". Most of the posters with my problem are being redirected there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to Logitech Options, I also have the following programs that are glitching/crashing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Word (Office 2013) - I am now unable to save anything! The program just hangs and becomes unresponsive. I have to force shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FastPictureViewer - &nbsp;The program now opens in a window instead of full screen. If I maximize or nudge the edge of the window in any way, it crashes</p>

            It is best to seek assistance with the device manufacturer regarding driver updates that will work with the latest Windows version.

            <p>Thanks for the lead Shilohbob. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a solution to my problem, which is detailed in the link to another thread above (in my reply to Romel Ram). The source of the problem was&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Riva Tuner</strong>, which is an adjunct overclocking
 controller for NVidia graphics cards. It came bundled with MSI afterburner. Uninstalling it fixed the problem with my
<strong>Logitech</strong> mouse utility and with <strong>FastPictureViewer</strong> at the same time. I've since installed a newer beta version of Riva Tuner (700 Beta19) that works without screwing up any of my other apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The problem I had with <strong>
MS Office</strong> was solved by turning off the anti exploit controls in Malwarebytes that pertain to Office apps. Here is the quote that provides the solution:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"This is an issue with Anti-exploit
 that we've addressed in standalone Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit. The changes should get pulled into MB3 in the future. For now, you can disable the Office apps from being protected in MB3 -&gt; Settings -&gt; Protections -&gt; Manage Protected Applications"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Basically, there are some compatibility&nbsp;concerns that exist between&nbsp;the Creators Update and certain programs. Over time, the developers of these programs will issue updates so that they can work with
 Windows CU.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Again, many thanks to this community and to the Logitech support community, both of which were instrumental in providing the clues to solve these problems within a short period of time. I'm very grateful!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Kernel Power crash need help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. So I don't know a lot about crashes and what not, so I'm going to give you my PC information and my crash log to see if this can be fixed. The past few weeks my PC has crashed unexpectedly, and sometimes in the middle of games, and i would
 get a blue screen. I don't know why, and I do not know what caused it.</p>

</p><p>PC Info:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>RAM - 16gb</p>
<p>EVGA Geforce GTX 1050Ti 4gb vram</p>
<p>Intel Core i5 cpu 750 @ 2.67 GHz, 4 cores</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have recently done:</p>
<p>-Replaced a gtx 460 with a 1050Ti</p>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Programs don&#39;t open when using desktop icons</h2>
                    
<p>Since my last automatic update, my desktop is not working correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I double-click on a desktop icon, and nothing happens.&nbsp; Yet, when I go to turn off my laptop, I get a window that says these programs I clicked on are open.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another instance, I downloaded a program off the internet and told it to Save to the desktop (instead of RUN), but the file does not appear on my desktop.</p>
<p>I re-installed Windows 7 (Professional) but no effect.</p>
