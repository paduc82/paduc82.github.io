<h2>            Sky Player help&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I was just wondering if there is a way to manually change the video quality on Sky Player, With it being set on auto it keeps changing quality which is getting on my nerves.</p>

<p>I know there used to be, it was pressing RB or LB and then Y (Whilst watching something) for the setting change I believe. Since the autoadjust feature was added I haven't really looked though.</p>
<p>May still be worth trying though.</p>

                    After latest update, the volume control on the task bar no longer works. &nbsp;Additionally, I cannot control the volume on Chrome pages. &nbsp; I can do it by opening the sound mixture but that means all of the pages I have open have the same volume. &nbsp;I am running
 Windows 10 (Home). &nbsp;Version 1703, Build 15063.413. &nbsp;I use the Chrome browser.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you recently updated your Windows 10, your sound drivers may have gone outdated. For steps on how to update your drivers, kindly follow the steps provided in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if updating the drivers resolved the issue.</p>

<p>Did those steps. &nbsp;But before I tried them today, looks like something else happened following a reboot. &nbsp;Now, I have control over the volume icon but I get no sound. &nbsp;Checked the web page, volume icon and the audio manager and none of them have the volume
 muted.</p>

            Hi Gloria.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />2) Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />3) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />4) Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br /> 
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />5) If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />6) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />7) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />8) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> 9) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />10) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>As with many things in Windows, there's more than one way to do this. I'll give you what I think is the best way, but other people may have different ideas which you should also consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to recover from a serious software problem that you cannot fix is to restore a system image. A system image is an exact copy of your C: drive. It's also known as a disk image or simply an 'image.' The C: drive includes Windows and all your software.
 It also includes all your personal data, unless you've created an additional partition for your personal data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't make a copy of your C: drive by simply copying all the files and folders, because you'll miss the part of your C: drive that enables your computer to boot. Windows can't access that part of the C: drive. Also, as a practical matter, copying everything
 on your C: drive would take a very long time while it takes just a few minutes to make an image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has its own image utility but it's in the process of being discontinued and Microsoft recommends the use of third-party image utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you restore an image, your computer goes back in time to the moment the image was made. It's a fabulous way to backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you learn how, it's easy to make an image and it takes just minutes. And you can schedule the image to occur automatically, while you sleep, so it's easy to make an image every day. Imagine having a complete copy of your computer that's never more then
 24 hours old. That's the beauty of making daily images. Restoring an image also takes just a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image application I use is called <a href="https://www.macrium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Macrium Reflect</a> but there are lots of other imaging applications that work very well. You can read about them on the web and check out the free trials.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete File Versions In File History</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I installed Windows 8 recently and I love it! I set up the File History service to backup my personal files every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>It works great but I have a problem!</p>
<p>When I went to the special settings to delete recent file versions, the program said that File History ControlDevice has stopped working. (Or something like this) I tried to reconnect my external hard drive and even restarted my PC but it doesn't work! Please
 help! Thank You!</p>

            you might try making a folder on the external drive named&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>anything&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; and right click, choose properties and share it .. make sure permissions says Everybody&nbsp;for a name and that account has full permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reboot your computer and then
 see if file history works.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Disabling PC sounds at night</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer runs tasks (inc a daily backup)&nbsp;overnight, but sometimes this also means that it makes sounds which can wake me up unless I've remembered to mute the speakers before I go to bed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is this - is there any way I can use something like Task Scheduler to automatically turn off the sound at a fixed time, and turn it back on again in the morning ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a DELL XPS420, running Windows 7 Home Premium. The PC has a Creative SoundBlaster X-Fi Xtreme sound card as well as an on-board HD sound device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            Yes, it is, I think you have mis-understand.<br />
<br />
PC sounds are the bells and whistles that sound when you get mail, make a mistake etc. and are
<br />
Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Sounds &gt; click on the Sounds tab &gt; turn off the annoying Windows sound schemes. Again, this will
<br />
I have a DAW setup and there is nothing worse when you're recording, than having a ding happening at a crucial moment !!! So I turn those noises off, which is what you want, but I can still make/play audio.<br />
<br />

            Hi lyrical64,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;Were you able to use adobe without any issue on your computer earlier?<br />
b.&nbsp;Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
c.&nbsp;Any recent changes made to your computer?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to turn off UAC (user account control) and reinstall&nbsp;adobe program.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</a>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you still face the same problem then,&nbsp;you&nbsp;may perform clean boot on your computer and check if this helps.<br />
<br />
Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To perform a clean boot on a computer, follow these steps.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Please monitor the system in the Clean Boot environment. If the problem does not occur, it indicates that the problem is related to one application or service we have disabled. You may use the MSCONFIG tool again to re-enable the disabled item one by one
 to find out the culprit.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If your issue is resolved, follow the How to Determine What is Causing the Problem section in the KB article to narrow down the exact source.
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a> . Also, see the section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may also check if the issue persists in safe mode and post back with the status so, that we can help you better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To use a Safe mode option, follow these steps: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the arrow keys to choose Safe Mode in Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />

    <title>Windows Explorer crashes when viewing folders with ANY image files in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pa-plinka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer crashes when viewing folders with ANY image files in them. Why&#63;</h2>
                    Here's what is happening in both Windows 7 Ultimate, and Windows 7 Starter; all current Microsoft updates have been applied (as of 2011-10-05) and all video drivers are up to date.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I open a folder which has any number of image files in it (such .png, .jpg, .bmp. .eps, .gif, and so on) - whether only one image file or dozens of image files, Windows Explorer starts struggling to show the folder contents, constantly refreshing itself
 until a crash occurs and a message to restart Windows Explorer appears. In the folder options, I have it set to NOT show any thumbnails or picture previews. I notice this happening whether I have the view options set for "Large icons" or "Details" in Windows
 Explorer--I'm merely trying to browse the folder/directory contents and do NOT need an image preview. It happens whether there are only image files in the folder and if there are files of mixed types in the folder (e.g. image files alone in the folder/directory,
 AND image files, Word Docx, .pdf, etc. all in one folder/directory).Notably, if I remove any image file/files from the directory, the folder/directory seems to behave itself as one would think the folder should behave (i.e. as if there is no problem whatsoever).
 It also happens if I put an image file onto the desktop (making the desktop constantly refresh itself and eventually crash if I let it keep refreshing itself often--usually I see this behavior occur and quickly-as-possible move the image file into a different
 folder/directory to make the problem stop for the moment).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have only seen this occur when using Windows 7 &nbsp;and Vista--not on XP.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can see where this would make an Art Director&nbsp;(or similar image-based professionals)&nbsp;not be very happy with Windows.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is going on in Windows Explorer to cause this issue, and what can be done to fix this problem?</div>
<div><br />

 is the first I've ever seen or heard of the problem you report, which is why I suspect malware.&nbsp; Take a look at forum moderator Keith's post at</p>

            No virii, nor a virus. I have seen this on several machines.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I use Microsoft Security Essentials and it, too, is up to date and regular scans are performed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The RAM is good, and it still happened on clean boot. Nothing not part of a standard MS Windows 7 installation is running upon start up (except for Microsoft Security Essentials) on the machines (one is running "Ultimate" and the other is running "Starter").
 Drivers are up to date (hence why I mentioned it previously).&nbsp;</div>

            All of the "Faulting Modules" appear to be Windows flies so it may be useful to try to capture a user-mode dump of the explorer.exe crash and see if there are any third party files involved.<br />
<br />
You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file, then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file at the time explorer.exe crashes should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
<br />
</em><br />
After Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />
<br />
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:<br />

<h2>            Unable to connect to Windows NT 4 from Windows 7 computer</h2>
                    <p>Original title: I am trying to LAN an old NT4 PC to my new Win7PC using an ethernet cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither machine can see the other. I have previously successfully connected the NT4 PC to an XP PC. This time the Win7 Network and Sharing Centre can see that something is there but calls it an unidentified public network. Diagnostics then gives the message
 "Local Area Connection doesn't have a valid IP configuration".<br />
<br />
What do I have to do to give it one?<br />

<h2>            epson printer driver - Stylus Photo RX520</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 8 64 bit and installed the windows 7 64 bit version of the driver for the Epson stylus photo RX520.&nbsp;&nbsp;The printer is recognised by the correct name in the list of connected printers, but when I print I do not have the full range of options
 that I used to have, all I can do is print and can't&nbsp;vary the quality, check ink levels etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under printer properties, it is using the standard Epson EXSC/P-R V4 Class driver, and not one specific to this printer.&nbsp; I've tried searching for a new driver under the advanced tab and selecting New Driver.&nbsp; Looking at the list of available updates, there
 are a number of different&nbsp;drivers for the photo stylus range, but not the RX520.&nbsp; I've tried windows update several times but it still doesn't have this version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had the printer a number of years and couldn't get it to work at all using the original disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Epson say that is should be compatible and that it is a problem with the Add printer and Windows software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help?&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<h2>            Game DVR degrades audio quality</h2>
                    <p>When I try to use game DVR to record gameplay with voice commentary included the audio&nbsp;lowers to an absolutely&nbsp;abysmal quality. However it's not necessarily the case when I record the game audio alone. The audio quality comes back to it's standard decent quality. Please note that I already tried to change audio quality from 128 kbs to 192 kbs and could not&nbsp;notice any changes. Can this be fixed by&nbsp; any possible way?<br /></p>

<h2>            Windows explorer crash after 1607 upgrade Win 10</h2>
                    I have 2 laptops and 1 desktop connected to a Thecus Linux based NAS File Server N7700 and N5500. When I update the desktop from Windows 10 Version 1511 (November update) to Windows 10 Version 1607 (Anniversary Update) Windows Explorer crashes when I eg

 to a network driver given it is only on the desktop i.e. it would make sense it is hardware dependent. The Laptops are old Intel's ASUS M61V and ASUS U50V. The troublesome desktop is an old AMD clone: AMD Phenom II X6 1055T 6 Core Processor Realtek PCIE GBE

<h2>            Ads and Premium&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Minesweeper has been bundled with Windows since I began using it at 3.11. It has always been an unobtrusive little distraction and has served that purpose very well. Like many things it is now considered to be part of Windows- part of the OS package. I must
 admit I was a little concerned to realise it was not installed out-of-the-box with a fresh install of Windows 8. I assumed that MS would want to recreate it under the new app platform and was pleased to see it in the store- however have since been a little
 put off. What was once a nice little feature of the OS now contains adverts, just like everything else in the OS. The new default video player is a screen full of adverts. The default music player is a massive screen full of online content. And now even the
 little games such as minesweeper are not only displaying adverts, but are offering "premium" subscriptions to remove them! Surely I can't be the only one who thinks that buying Windows means you've bought minesweeper! I can see the next iteration to have ads
 on the start screen that you can remove with a subscription! That's even worse than a flat fee. Let's face it, they could charge £0.69 for minesweeper and people would pay, or they could offer a paid premium version, but instead they're asking for a recurring
 subscription to minesweeper! That's pathetic and if this is the way all Microsoft apps are going I'll be jumping ship soon.</p>

                    <p>Original title: AppData Roaming Folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have moved (copy) the AppData Roaming folder to an external drive using the Windows tool (location tab)&nbsp;from the properties panel. Can I now delete it from my C drive? It is taking 10GB of space and I am running low in space on my C drive. Running Win
 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hard drive is divided in C and D. C drive has the operating system (mainly)&nbsp;and other things/stuff that I cannot control. All my programs are in D.

            <p><font color="#000000">Hi Jean,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">It is not recommended to delete Appdata\Roaming folder as it typically contains settings, temporary and cache files for many of your installed applications. In fact, once you look for the sub-folders under the name, you will find other
 folders related to different application installed on the computer. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">If the folder is consuming too much space on the hard drive, it could be due to some of the files related to certain application installed on the computer which you may not know about. You might browse around a bit and find out which
 one it is in the folder. If any of the file name that looks or related to any application which you do not use or require on the computer, you may go ahead and uninstall the application from Control Panel.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Hope the information helps.</font></p>

            <i>"What the system did, it made a copy of the entire roaming folder to the new location but left the old one at the same place."</i><br />
<br />
Is this current folder the 'real' Roaming folder, or the shortcuts in the 'Library' ?<br />
The 'real' folder should have been moved, while a 'Library' would be created in the process.<br />
<br />
You could try an experiment (assuming you are not referring to the Libraries). <br />
Either rename the&nbsp; Roaming folder, or create a new sub-folder in the Roaming folder and<br />
move all the existing files/sub-folders&nbsp; into that.<br />
Creating a new sub-folder may be the better option to avoid Windows creating yet another Roaming folder.<br />
- If you have problems with the software that uses this data then move the files back into the<br />
original Roaming folder.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't gain a lot of HDD space just moving the Roaming folder. <br />
I believe most people move the whole User folder, or the music, video and photos folders if they have<br />
a lot of these files, when needing more disk space.<br />

<p>I'm working with a laptop which I had run "Reset this PC" because any new accounts created were not set up correctly e.g. no "Start Menu" plus the region was set to Afghanistan and couldn't be changed in "Settings" and search would not work in Cortana. The
 "Region" setting In control panel didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway a partial success - I opened <strong>REGEDIT </strong>but was unable to find the
<strong>GEO </strong>key under&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\International</strong></p>
<p>So I thought I try and create one but was denied access - "no permissions".</p>
<p>So I right clicked on the key, selected "permissions" ADDED my user ID, "Checked Names", and set the permissions to FULL CONTROL.</p>
<p>Low and behold the GEO key appeared - :) like magic!! - and was set to the UK (242)</p>
<p>However, I needed to sign out and in again before it took effect.</p>
<p>I was then able to open "Region" in the control panel and set it up for UK, keyboard, dates etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update - after the reboot all seems well with Regional settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check "Related Settings" and select "Region" and the "Administrative" tab "Copy Settings" and check both boxes at the bottom to make sure new accounts are created correctly"</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEST OF LUCK! cookinpro</p>

<p>Hi George,<br />
</p>
<p>I finally figured out how to resolve my issues.<br />
<br />
I went to Tweaking.com and installed Windows Repair v 3.9.31 (Free Version)<br />
Under the “Repair” tab (located on the top row) set only these repairs<br />
<br />
01-Reset Registry Permissions<br />
02-Reset File Permissions<br />
03-Reset Service Permissions<br />
04-Register System Files<br />
09-Repair Hosts File<br />
10-Remove Policies Set by Infections<br />
<br />
Make sure all other repairs are not selected (unless, of course you are positive that they apply to your situation)<br />
<br />
Make sure to do a registry backup and also set a restore point (both can be set up within Windows Repair v 3.9.31 (Free Version)- this step is very important<br />
<br />
Make sure to run this in Windows “safe mode with networking”<br />
<br />
You will be prompted to reboot when the repairs are finished running-(you may have to run the repairs twice)<br />
</p>
<p>This fixed : HKEY_CURRENT_ USER\Control Panel\International\Geo (previously, "geo" was not listed) upon rebooting "geo" magically appeared and I was able set the identifier to "Canada"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, searches worked in Cortana, the clock works properly, region settings work in Control Panel and Microsoft Store finally works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
