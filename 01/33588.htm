            Check the Toshiba website for your model. They likely have an online user guide that would tell you where the battery is located. Generally, though if you flip the laptop over you'll see a couple of release switches for the battery if it's removable.

<h2>            My Windows 10 Upgrade download takes way too long...</h2>
                    I currently have been waiting for my Windows 10 upgrade to download now for over 9 hours. I opened the 'Get Windows 10' icon on my task bar and clicked on the Upgrade now button. Next the window that shows that the download is starting shows for a long
 time, and after a period of time it switches over to Windows Update, where even there nothing happens. It just says that the download is starting, but I cannot see any Internet processing on my Task Manager. This as I said has been happening for over 9 hours
 now. I currently have Windows 7 Professional installed on my computer.

<h2>            Skype</h2>
                    New Skype user. Running Windows 7 with Skype 7. Received Skype call and audio/video was good. However, the small window that should show what my face looks like to the remote person shows their face instead (therefore, I can't see what I look like to them).
 Any suggestions? Thanks.

<h2>            The Surface Pro 2 Docking Station is  a complete disappointment.</h2>
                    Let's see. No dual monitor support. No esata. No slim optical drive bay slot. No deal. I was truly hoping I could replace my laptop with this. Not going to happen and this would not work for anyone in my office due to the lack of dual external monitor
 support.<br />
<br />
$199, this is a complete deal breaker. My HP dock has all these features and cost less than $200. What gives microsoft?<br />

            <p>The Surface Pro 2 supports Display Port 1.2 that allows Daisy Chaining, so you can easily have two external monitors....</p>
<p><br />

<p>Most modern docks don't have optical drives and eSATA has been supplanted by USB 3.0.</p>

            eSATA and Optical drive bay I can look past, though it would be nice and for $200 very doable. But only 1 display port, even though I didn't know you could daisy chain them, is still a deal breaker. I would have to either buy new monitors that support
 daisychaining or buy an $80 adapter on top of the $200 price for the dock and +/- $1,000 for the surface 2.<br />
<br />
HP has a dock for the elietpad that cost $150 and has VGA and HDMI. Let's hope the next gen has 2 HDMI or Display Ports.<br />

<div>I just bought a Surface Pro 2 (512GB) to replace my laptop. Needed to run the full version of AutoCAD, Office and other stuff. &nbsp;As the DisplayPort 1.2 driver is not ready yet, I am using a Toshiba Dynadock running a Dell 24 inch 1920 x 1200 and a Samsung
 24 inch 1920 x 1200. &nbsp;Works a charm (a bit faster than the Lenovo X1 with 160GB SSD and 8 GB RAM) and more portable. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>A number of years ago I got rid of my desktop PC and now the laptop has gone too! &nbsp;Great for interstate travelling. Very happy.</div>

            my Dock was a complete disappointment for me ,the mini display port wouldn't work ,i talked to 10 different support agents and one SMART guy suggested to send me a replacement that is on its way ,lets see if i ll finally be able to connect to my brand
 new HD TV.
<div><br />
<div>I agree that the dock could have been much better and cheaper ,but remember that this is the first time EVER MS produces a docking station in their history ,do not expect them to be perfect.</div>

            Another solution mentioned to be working is to use the dock's displayport for one monitor, and a USB3 to DVI/HDMI/Displayport adapter for the second monitor, like the ones listed here:
<div><a href="http://www.displaylink.com/shop/adapters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.displaylink.com/shop/adapters/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Not really any more ideal than using a Toshiba Dynadock, but it gets the job done until MS can finally fix their Display Port 1.2 issues.</div>

<p>Chris (CFRandall),</p>
<p>I'm glad to read about your experience with Plugable UD-3900. I have been surprised with the lack of discussion regarding it (and almost all other products from Plugable - I have used a few Plugable items including another USB 3.0 to DVI adapter).</p>
<p>I use the Surface Pro 2 with the Surface dock and am close to buying this (the UD-3900).</p>
<p>I currently am using a Monoprice&nbsp;27" monitor (2560x1440 resolution) with Dual Link DVI. But, I want to add at least one more monitor to this setup. (The Monoprice doesn't have a DVI-D out, so daisy-chaining is not option - AFAIK)</p>
<p>Based on everything I have read, I think the UD-3900 will fit the bill (and I will probably add another monitor to this new setup with the UD-3900 :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Manoj</p>

<h2>            5.1 Speakers with Creative Sound Blaster Live&#33; Center speaker and sub not playing</h2>
                    
<p>5.1 Speakers with Creative Sound Blaster Live! Center speaker and sub not playing using the the Winodows Sound Test tool found in PLAYBACK DEVICES &gt; CONFIGURE</p>
<p>I have tried plugging the speakers into my other Windows 7 PC and it works, i have tried 2 different PCI sound cards on the problem computer and still no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Front Right, front left, rear right and rear left speakers are OK and will sound with a "dinging" noise when i click them in the graphic display, but by center speaker, no matter what drivers i install, doesnt make any sound........</p>

<h2>            No permission to install Printer Driver with administrator rights</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 -64 bit Home Premium. I have problem installing my Canon MP 145. Although the Scanning part of the multifunction device seems to be working, I am unable to print. It seems that I am not given the permission to access certain folders,
 like Windows/system32, even though I am installing the driver from an administrator account.<br />

This is what I have. After installing the printer driver, there are two icons appeared in the Devices and Printers window, one as Canon MP 140 Series Printer, and the other as Inkjet Multifunction Printer. Although the former icon has a green tick on it, when
 I right click and select Printing Preferences, an error message stating "Printing preferences cannot be displayed. Access is denied." The same goes to the Printer Properties. The error message in this case is "Printer properties cannot be displayed. Access
 is denied.<br />
<br />
In all the applications, they are unable to print.<br />
<br />
Also other applications like Nitro PDF Reader also has problem installing its PDF generating driver.<br />
<br />
What can I do?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue occurs because the colon is used as the delimiter character when the print spooler service tries to check whether the current user has the required access

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
To answer to your questions, here is my answer, <br />
<br />
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did you make any changes to your computer?<br />
I receive this computer from a relative. So, I deleted his account and recreated new accounts, including administrator account, in my name. So, now I suspect in the process, I also deleted the so called "built-in administrator account."<br />
<br />
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Are you using network printer sharing?<br />
No. However, when I ran the troubleshooter some time ago, it did claim that this is the problem. But even if I share the printer, I am still not able to install the driver or use the printer.<br />
<br />
As to the methods you suggest, I have tried method 01 numerous times.<br />
<br />
Previously, I also have problem installing my ATI graphic driver. However, after some troubleshooting, I changed the security setting of the folder where I install the driver, then I am allowed to install the driver.<br />
<br />
It seems like at the moment, I do not 'own' this computer even though I am the sole user and have an administrator account. I suspect that I need to somehow enable myself the rights to write to the windows/system32 folder in order to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
I even tried the command "net user administrator /active:yes". but the problem is still there. Is there anyway to get back the default setting on the user rights?<br />
<br />
Also, is there anyway of restoring WIndows 7 SP1 to its default state? I cannot use the original WIndows 7 DVD as it says that I am using SP1. I cannot uninstall SP1 since I do not have the rights, nor can I restore to a earlier restore point for the same reason.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
<br />
        </p>

    <title>can&#39;t disable malfunctioning laptop mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivana-likualova  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t disable malfunctioning laptop mouse</h2>
                    I have a dell precision m6300 which I upgraded to windows 8.1. The touchpad had some water spilled on it, and I don't care that is doesn't work properly since I use a travel mouse. Only problem is that now windows thinks I'm constantly clicking all the
 mouse buttons under the touchpad. I can still do anything I want with a huge hassle, but windows 8 seems to make it impossible to disable the touchpad/mouse by greying out the "disable" feature. I am very good at troubleshooting through device manager etc.,
 but I have exhausted every method and concluded it is impossible using standard windows troubleshooting/hardware management. Can anyone help me hack around this bug? This would be easy to do on earlier versions of windows but even installing non-generic drivers
 (with more functionality) is a royal pain and they don't seem to function even in compatability mode. Help please and skip the standard stuff. Trust me, I've tried that. Thanks in advance.

            I just took apart my laptop and unplugged the touchpad. Problem solved, though with windows xp, I would have just had to push two buttons and solved it with software. Thanks microsoft for wasting 8 hours of my time and giving me a genuine windows headache.
 Really? No off button? With all its bugs, microsoft still blows apple out of the water, but you'd think an "off" feature would be essential for any hardware, malfunctioning or not.

            I'm aware that a disable button should be there. It's greyed out so I have to find other options. By unplugging my touchpad I disabled my mute button, which is kind of annoying, so if I can get a software fix, that would still be nice. Device manager only
 gives me the option of uninstalling the drivers, after which it prompts me to restart and reinstalls them immediately. I figured out how to replace the **itty microsoft drivers with the drivers from the manufacturer (designed for vista or xp), but the drivers
 are not fully functional on windows 8. The button which in XP or Vista gets to the screen where I can turn off touchpad/buttons feature doesn't respond. This microsoft bug requires an ingenious hack of some sort.

            I've been using my Administrator account. That is not a solution. My wireless mouse has a disable button in the device manager which works fine, but the touchpad mouse does not. It's as if windows has made it impossible to disable touchpads or something

            There was no problem disabling it before I switched to windows 8. Definitely not the manufacturer. A permissions problem? What does that even mean?

<h2>            Black bars on all sides in any resolution</h2>
                    <p>My PC resolution is 1920x1200 and when recording with Nvidia Shadowplay, the recordings are 1728x1080. If I view these recordings in their raw form, they are completely full screen with no black bars anywhere. If I put them into Windows Movie maker, they
 show black bars in the preview, even when set to widescreen aspect. If I publish the movie, it always show black bars on every side (top, left, right, and bottom). I've tried 1920x1080, 1728x1080, and 1680×1050 (16:10 downscale) all with the same result. I
 can't set it to 1920x1200 because the max height it allows is 1080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I take this same raw footage and put it in adobe premier with the same output resolutions, I do not get the black bars, so what is going on here?</p>

<p>Movie Maker can output two aspect ratios:</p>
<p>4:3 fullscreen (1.33) </p>
<p>16:9 widescreen (1.78)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But your PC screen resolution is neither of these aspect ratios. You can see by dividing the two dimensions:</p>
<p>1920/1200 = 5:3 (1.6)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if it is scaled down to a vertical resolution of 1080p, it is still staying in this aspect ratio and doesn't fill a full 1920 width:</p>
<p>1728/1080 = 5:3 (1.6)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when you put this video into a Movie Maker project, it will fill the frame vertically, but you'll have about 100 pixels on either side that are empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when you playback this 1920 x 1080 video, it won't fill the full 1920 x 1200 screen so you get 60 pixels of black on top and bottom. You'd have this same problem if you loaded the video on YouTube since it expects 16:9 video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do. You could set your game so it plays in a 1920 x 1080 rectangle and record that. That would at least make it fit perfectly in a Movie Maker project at 1920 x 1080. But then if you play it back on your monitor, you
 wouldn't have black on the sides, but you'd still have it on top and bottom. It would look correct on YouTube however, or if you put it onto a Blu-ray player and/or played it on an HDTV.</p>

<h2>            Inactive account</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I currently have two accounts. I have my old account, and this account. I don't use the other account anymore, but I have expensive game licenses on it, and I can access it anytime. My question is, if the account stays inactive for a long time, does
 it get suspended or deleted? I just don't to lose my game licenses, I worked hard for the money that the account has for those games...</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>There has been nothing said recently about recycling inactive accounts. The one time Microsoft recycled accounts, they were accounts from the original Xbox I believe, and that was a couple years ago.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I have a gamertag from many, many years ago that I log into once in a great while just to show activity. I do the same thing with the email accounts I use to use.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>You're fine, the account will not disable due to inactive account because since 2011, I had to move to another sate and the one I'm using to post this, I just re log in last month and it works fine(on vacation and taking 360 back with me). Make sure you
 don't delete the old account if you want to use the games, dlc etc... on your new account.</p>

<h2>            Cannot upgrade back to 1903 after a 1809 rollback</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 1903 and it caused an error with Trend Micro &amp; PDQ Deploy so I used the rollback feature to take me back to 1809. Now I cannot go back to 1903. If I search for Windows Updates it says I'm all up to date. It also says that I already
 have 1903 installed but my version is clearly 1809 when I type 'winver'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this, I want to upgrade without fresh installing Windows.</p>

            HI Rushing.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's probably being blocked by buggy WIndows Update Assistant which is another reason why it's never the best way to do a version Upgrade via buggy WIndows Updates.
<br />
<br />I would manually upgrade to the latest version by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I would also uninstall those two apps that caused the previous problem.  I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, restart the PC, then type Security in Start Search, open Windows Defender Settings, there and in Windows Defender Security Center fix anything that's flagged.  
<br />
<br /> If you want the best on-demand scanner install run Download and install Malwarebytes from <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />In it's Settings &gt; Protection &gt; Scan Options enable Scan for Rootkits.  
<br />Then on Scan tab choose Threat Scan and Run Scan.  
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Next check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can disable its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Accounts tab.  
<br /> 
<br />If it won't run the Upgrade, this can mean your install is corrupted and would have problems.  What we've found in Windows 10 is that everything depends upon the quality of the install.  You can follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to wait then if it is pushing itself you can block the Version Update until the next one and then try installing it the same way.  The latest version 1903 should be released any day now:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Skype and XBOX authentication issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djroot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype and XBOX authentication issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am log time user of Skype. &nbsp;Over the past few days, Skype has been kicking me off for no apparent reason...this happened just a few minutes ago (11:35AM ET). &nbsp;I went to log back on with the Skype name and password and the system says that my password is
 incorrect. &nbsp;This has happened at least 4 times this week. &nbsp;System logs me off / I go to log back on / the system does not recognize my password. &nbsp;The good news is that I can reset my password and all conversations are intact, but this behavior is troublesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>XBOX - same issue. &nbsp;My son logs off, then logs back on and the system does not recognize his password. &nbsp; This has happened 3-4 times this week. &nbsp;Like Skype, operation is fine after resetting the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>DJRoot</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That is quite unusual behavior of the application or the account.<strong> As long as you type in the correct password</strong>, it should not give you that error message. Please confirm the following so we can isolate the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to the Skype website. Observer if the same behavior happens.&nbsp;</li><li>Sign in to the other devices which has the Skype application installed.</li><li>Try to sign in a different Skype account to the application you are using wherein your account is logged off and check if the same situation happens.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let us know the results so we can assist you further.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in&nbsp;Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Has the issue started to occur recently?</p>
<p>b. Did you make any significant changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>c. Does the issue appear only at the login screen?</p>
<p>d. Are you able to enter password or login to the desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the snapshot, you are getting unknown letters on the login screen. There is a possibility of a system file corruption, third party software conflict or a virus infection. In order to troubleshoot the issue, I would suggest you to try the following
 methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>Try to boot the system in safe mode and check if&nbsp;the issue is reproduced. If not, then clean boot the computer and check if it helps.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode in which you are logged in with only necessary minimal services and drivers enabled. Check if the issue is reproduced.
</span><span>Refer to the following steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on the Power button on the login screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press and hold the SHIFT key on keyboard and simultaneously click on
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong> option.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once your PC restarts, on the<strong><span>Choose an option</span></strong> screen, tap or click
<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong><span><span>.</span></span><br />
If you don't see the <strong><span>Startup Settings</span></strong> option, tap or click
<strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Tap or click <strong><span>Startup Settings</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Tap or click <strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the <strong><span>Startup Settings</span></strong> screen, choose the startup setting for
<strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong> (Generally <strong><span>F5</span></strong> key is pressed to select this setting).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Sign in to your PC with a user account that has administrator rights.&nbsp;</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue does not reproduce in Safe Mode, then try to clean boot the system and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></em></p>
<p><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></em></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “Windows 8.1 and Windows 8” given in the section “How to determine
 what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot” from the same given link.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The issue may also exist due to a virus infection. So, you may also run&nbsp;the Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure computer is free from infections:<br />
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<strong><br />
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong></strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>

<h2>            PC to TV HDMI Connection disappeared</h2>
                    Yesterday I connected my pc to my tv via an hdmi cable and it worked for a bit. When it was working the tv was shown&nbsp; in the devices window but now it is gone. I can't get the connection back. I don't know what happened. I connected the cable to a different
 tv and it worked, so now I know there is some issue between the pc an the tv.

========================<br />
1. Click Start. In the Start Search box type "devmgmt.msc" and press Enter.<br />
2. Expand "Display Adapters", double-click on the entry of the Display device.<br />
3. Click the tab "Driver", click "Uninstall".<br />
4. Click Start. In the Start Search box type "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter. <br />
5. Remove the entries related to the Display device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then reinstall the driver with your driver CD.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively, you can try to uninstall the driver from the Device Manager, then go to the computer or the device Manufactures website download the latest
 driver for your Network Adapter and install it.</span></span></p>

    <title>Bluetooth troubles-- &#34;bluetooth device not found.&#34; error after - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth troubles-- &#34;bluetooth device not found.&#34; error after about 30 seconds.</h2>
                    <p><u><em>Original Title</em></u>: <strong>Bluetooth troubles.</strong></p>
<p>Hello I have XP with all updates installed up to date. I am trying to install a usb bluetooth adapter device. The driver installs fine, but the wizard will not start to configure the usb bluetooth device. If I try to open a bluetooth icon from any location,
 it does not open. And if I right click on one, the only choice i get is "start using bluetooth". After 30 seconds or so the message comes up saying "bluetooth device not found." The device does work on another computer I have which has the same OS. I should
 add the device is installed nicely in Device Manager. Thanks for any help in advance! &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Bluetooth support comes from the device manufacturer - of the device inside your computer as well as the external bluetooth device you are trying to pair with.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the latest driver and software for your internal bluetooth device.</p>

            Hi- Yes, thank you for that, but I have been in touch with the manufacturer, they gave up. Said it's a windows problem, and I agree. I don't know either, it is installed, the thing is on and running but the setup cannot go forward until the wizard starts,
 as far as I know. The drivers are the latest from their site. I have re-installed a few times with no difference.<br />
Thanks-<br />

            Image the system (full bit-for-bit copy) to external media.&nbsp; Wipe the system.&nbsp; Install Windows fresh with all current patches and dreivers for your hardware (but not much else) and see if it works.&nbsp; If it does - something *is* messed up with your installation
 of Windows XP.&nbsp; If it does not - unlikely anything is wrong with your installation of Windows XP as it stands, could be hardware.&nbsp; You can restore the old image either way.

            Hi Shenan OK, I may try that but that will take some time for sure, downloading all the latest service packs and all. And honestly I really don't know how to image a system yet, but I can figure it out. I have a large 2nd hard disk I can save it to. Thanks<br />

<h2>            I get a screen while booting the computer.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my system hung and had to do a force restart. I get a screen while booting my computer with few options. I have to click ESC multiple times to get rid of the screen. It wasn't an option before. When I start my computer it used to boot normally.
 How to get rid of the screen? Please advice.</p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed the issue by unplugging the hard disc cable inside the CPU and connected them again. Everything is fine now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system is not booting or getting hung at the booting stage, you can try the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again John and Gerry. </p>
