<p>I too have the same problem and the fix hasn't worked.</p>
<p>I'm using a Yahoo mail address, does this have a significance??</p>
<p>Everything was fine until Windows 10 install, now I am either not receiving some mail, it's bouncing back or on two occasions now mail I have sent just doesn't go anywhere after I hit send and isn't listed in my sent folder, so I have to retype it.</p>
<p>Never been so frustrated with my e-mail set-up as I am now!!!</p>

            <p>I have same problem but it seems most other people using Windows 10 have it too. Like others I have tried all the so-called Microsoft "fixes" but it is obvious that this is a system error related to Windows 10 Mail when migrating from other email providers
 to Windows 10. Come on Microsoft it is about time you issued an update to cut out this annoying problem before millions of us go back to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect that Microsoft will ignore this problem (covered up, of course, by a load of useless platitudes) as usual.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the language bar keeps disappearing after every reboot. I will be glad to assist you with your query. However, let me as you ask you;</p>
<ol>
<li>Which security software is&nbsp;installed in your computer?</li></ol>
<p>The set of buttons and options on the Language bar changes depending on the text services you have installed and the software program that's currently active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer to the article and check the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/language-bar-overview#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>The Language bar (overview)</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue also can be caused due to third party software conflict. Hence, I would&nbsp;suggest you to start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have booted computer in safe mode, perform clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, try to disable to anti-virus software and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/disable-antivirus-software#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Disable antivirus software</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><span><em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>

</p><p>HI Likhitha V</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, since my post I've received a reply from NVIDIA (pasted below) which basically says that my graphics card is not compatible with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also found that W10 is not recognising my monitor (HP w1907v) and has defaulted to "Generic non-pNp monitor". I've looked for a HP driver but the latest version available is for Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>"My name is Mansoor, assisting you with your query specific to Windows 10 driver for the GeForce 7100 / nForce 630i chipset.<br />
<br />
I am sorry; but the GeForce 7100 GPU is not compatible with Windows 10 OS and thereby we don't have supporting driver.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 is compatible with GeForce 8 and higher series.<br />
<br />
Adding to that, the GeForce 7100 GPU comes on a nForce 630i chipset based motherboard; which means before upgrading the graphics card you would also need to check Windows 10 compatibility with the nForce 430 chipset based motherboard.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we don't have Windows 10 driver for motherboard chipsets and you may need to use Windows auto-update - which may or may not work. This is hardware limitation as these are legacy chipsets."</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><span>All in All I'm beginning to think it was a mistake to "upgrade" to W10</span></p>
<p><span>Any suggestions welcome</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards</span></p>
<p><span>Derek</span></p>

            OK, I see it is a NVIDIA driver, but the site lists it as a 32 bit driver. My windows 10 is 64 bit. Is this a problem?

            <p>I found a really easy fix for this problem. &nbsp;Due to a compatibility issue Windows 10 defaults to the basic adapter, just follow this link for more info and download the drivers.</p>

            1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

<strong>Original Title: Error Code: 0x8024001e</strong></p>

<p>I am having Dell Laptop (Inspiron 7520). Initially, I got Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit Preinstalled from Dell. Later on I upgraded to Windows 8.&nbsp; Also I was having McAfee as Anti virus preinstalled on my laptop which I deleted properly after taking the
 online help of McAfee technical staff and now I am having Windows Defender to protect my Laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like other people I&nbsp;too got Windows 8 installed on my Laptop with&nbsp;a lot of apps. Sometimes updates are available for these apps but when I install those updates from STORE an error occurs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS APPLICATION WASN'T INSTALLED: VIEW DETAILS</p>
<p>And when I click View Details it says as follows:</p>
<p>SOMETHING HAPPENED AND THIS APP COULDN'T BE INSTALLED. PLEASE TRY AGAIN. ERROR CODE: 0x80024001e</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to chat with Microsoft staff, Read the forum and&nbsp;took the help of local technical staff but nothing happened.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried solutions suggested by them&nbsp;"WHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AN APP", Downloaded APPS TROUBLESHOOTER, Checked the setting for Windows Update as well as Apps. Update, Sync the License of Apps. etc. etc. but nothing is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At last the problem is still their. I AM NOT ABLE TO UPDATE MY APPS.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Aanurag,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums and thanks for posting the question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the description, it seems you are facing issues with installing Apps from Windows Store Update and getting an Error
 Code 0x8024001E. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To assist you better I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue?</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: Clear the cache from Windows store.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time you access a file through your web browser, the browser caches (i.e., stores) it. By doing this, the browser doesn't have to newly retrieve files (including
 any images) from the remote web site each time you click Back or Forward. You should periodically clear the cache to allow your browser to function more efficiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the steps given below.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>"Windows+R"</b> key on the keyboard to open Run window.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the Run window type <b>
"wsreset.exe"</b> and then click ok it will clear all the cache in Windows store
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go to Windows Store and try to download any app after performing the steps given above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Temporality disables security software and check for the issue.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please disable the Microsoft or any Security Systems if you have on your system.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b> Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't
 disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go to the link given below to follow as a reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This information should help. If you need further assistance regarding Windows, please post. We will be happy to help
 you.</span></p>

            <p>It is unbelievable I got the solution. My problem got solved with simple solution and the solution is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>go to c:\windows</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then find a file named SoftwareDistribution and now rename this file as softwaredistribution.old</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now come out and restart</p>

            Hi Temo, this is a new one on me, never heard of this . . .
<br />
<br />You may have inadvertently downloaded a PUP that piggy backed on some other software called DLL File Fixer or Dll Fixer
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />
<br />Look for DLL File Fixer, if you find it, uninstall it
<br />
<br />Also have a look at your Start up items:
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See if DLL File Fixer is listed there 
<br />If it is, select it and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining see if DLL File Fixer is listed there, uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />Restart your System and this annoyance will be gone . . .

<h2>            Application Errors Prevent File Open and More</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having major similar issues with several applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I try to open a file using&nbsp;Word, Excel &amp; Outlook my PC frequently&nbsp; hangs (but not always).&nbsp; With Norton Ghost 14 I have been having similar difficulties when trying to the backup destination
 which also involves using a file open component.&nbsp; I am also finding the Norton Applications will not start or the icons do not display in the System Tray.</p>
<p>I have found a series of errors to do with this in the Application Event Log.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please could someone give me some idea what they mean and how to fix them??? There are two warnings referring to the trace file and then errors referring to not being able to
 find a registry entry.</p>
<p>(I have had to uninstall and reinstall Norton applications, on several occasions&nbsp;using the Norton Removal Tool which may have something to do with this ... the problem started after this ...)</p>

<p><span>Hi Patrick,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that this caused by Norton ghost program on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you completely uninstall all the products related with the Norton using the Norton removal tool and later check if the issue
 persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Very bad performance on Windows 10 after the Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickertynl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very bad performance on Windows 10 after the Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Before the&nbsp;Anniversary Update I had a wonderful time working and gaming on Windows 10 Pro, but since then I have had performance issues within numerous applications and most notably real-time 3D software and games.<br />
I have tried to find and apply solutions that I have found online, that seemed to be related to the problems I am experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried and did not solve the issues (not necessarily in this order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable Xbox App's DVR capturing;</li><li>Windows Reset (lost all my installed software and set me back many hours);</li><li>Clean reinstall of graphics drivers (GTX 560Ti);</li><li>Multiple Windows Troubleshooters;</li><li>Clean boot, as described on the Microsoft website;</li><li>Application Compatibility settings;</li></ul>
<p>Symptoms of the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sluggish application performance;</li><li>Horrendous real-time 3D performance (where I used to attain a capped 60 fps, I am now faced with no more than 8 fps);</li><li>The first few minutes after booting of the PC the performance seems fine, but takes a nose-dive seemingly without a cause;</li><li>Black flashes/flickering of one or multiple screens;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I am a self-employed game developer who can no longer properly test, let alone work with the software that is required for my profession. Please help!<br />

            <p>I have recently cleared the <strong>System Event log</strong>, as it was cluttered with logs from application development. I will let a few days pass to accumulate some logs before I will upload them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I have noted is that the "<strong>black flashes</strong>" most likely have to do with this problem, because they appear only after some time has passed and after having had some of these flashes, the performance is severely degraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed an older Video Card driver, in case there were some compatibility issues with the latest ones and the latest
<strong>Anniversary Update</strong>. At first it seemed as if it solved the issues I was having, but I have concluded that the age of the drivers didn't affect the performance. What did surprise me is that the "black flashes" were gone at least until the
<strong>next reboot</strong> and performance was also restored, but again only until the next reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will help shed some light on this issue and might give you some clues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS:</strong> the performance issues seem to come in two phases: the first almost halves the frame-rate (about 32 fps) and the second brings it down to around 8 fps (<strong>sometimes including decimals, which I consider to be very odd</strong>).</p>

            <p>Very similar issues.&nbsp; Everything was good until the Win 10 Anniversary Update hit me on Sept 6, and continuing after an update just a day or two ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system seems fine until I run something that uses my Nvidia adapter... like x-plane.&nbsp; The game itself
 is fine, with a high frame rate, but other applications on the Win desktop become very unresponsive...notepad click response 30 seconds&nbsp;approx&nbsp;.. windows explorer same very&nbsp;slow&nbsp;on mouse clicks&nbsp;... right click on the bar for task manager produces nothing at
 all... many other examples.&nbsp; After the Nvidia game is shutdown, slow and unresponsive continues until a reboot.&nbsp; I have updated and reinstalled Nvidia drivers and am current.&nbsp; I have not tried uninstallng Nvidia and reinstalling.&nbsp; I have not tried to rollback
 all these system changes.&nbsp; Here are the two logs you wanted to get uploaded.&nbsp; Thanks for taking a look.&nbsp; Let me know if you are unable to access etc.</p>

            Update.&nbsp; I have a consistent workaround that temporarily eliminates the problem.&nbsp; After booting up, or resuming, if I disable and then enable the Nvidia device, in Device Manager, the problem does not occur until after another suspend/resume or restart/reboot
 of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Do you have HP Mediasmart webcam installed?<br />
<br />
I have a dv7 and had to reinstall Hp Mediasmart to use my webcam.<br />
<br />
In&nbsp;the favorites tab in internet explorer you should have an HP folder go to software and drivers download.<br />
Allow it to automatically detect your computer.<br />
<br />
When it has completed it will give options cilck software and drivers.<br />
<br />
HP Mediasmart is about halfway or more down the page.<br />
<br />
You can download just the webcam software&nbsp;or all, I downloaded all mediasmart programs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this Helps<br />

<h2>            Allocation size when formatting. What is best and why&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I just formatted my usb 8gb drive into NTFS. Check this link if you do not know how to:<a href="http://arunjohnny.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/how-to-format-usb-pen-drive-to-ntfs-file-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://arunjohnny.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/how-to-format-usb-pen-drive-to-ntfs-file-system/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have formatted various devices or drives before. I was wondering something. When&nbsp;does the allocation size matter? Why choose default allocation size, 512 bytes, 1024 bytes, 2048 bytes, 4096 bytes? Does it matter about the programs, or types of files you
 use? Maybe in video editing, music creation, networks, gaming, etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I choose default or 4096 bytes. I understand that if a file in my suitation was say 3998 bytes it takes a 4096 byte section. I believe RAID would fill every possible section, right? With RAID: It may/does split up the files to fill all sections?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anything change with SSD's, HHD's&nbsp;or an OS (XP, Vista, Win7)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hi Brian,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In computer file systems, a cluster is the unit of disk space allocation for files and directories. To reduce the overhead of managing on-disk
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On a disk that uses 512-byte sectors, a 512-byte cluster contains one sector, whereas a 4-kibibyte (KiB) cluster contains eight sectors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Generally, this type of thing happens when a program conflict makes one or the other stop working, maybe even for just a few seconds. During those few seconds, Windows will pick it up and give you that popup. Here's a possible solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Start or Windows Orb/Button. </li><li>In the search bar, type "system" (without the quotes) </li><li>At the top of the search results, there will be an option for "System Configuration"
</li><li>A window willl pop up, with several tabs and options. Click on the "General" Tab
</li><li>Under that tab, there will be a selection for "selective startup". Click this.
</li><li>Then,&nbsp;two options will become clickable under that, de-select "Load Startup Items"
</li><li>&nbsp;Reboot your computer. <strong>! WARNING: Don't access the internet during this time as you will be vulnerable to viruses, spyware, and malware!</strong>
</li><li>Once it boots back up, launch Carbonite Backup, as no programs will be running.</li></ol>
<p>The problem should be solved. If it is, turn on your antivirus program right away and enjoy your working computer. If not,</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow steps 1-5 above to back to System Configuration. </li><li>Under selective startup, also de-select Load Services. </li><li>Reboot the computer. </li><li>Once it starts up, Launch Carbonite.</li></ol>
<p>It should now be solved. If not, there is definitely a problem with either&nbsp;Carbonite, or with how Carbonite and Windows are working together,&nbsp;and you should contact them further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further assitance, if this does solve the problem, then slowly launch your normal programs one-by-one until the issue ocurrs again. You have now isolated the program conflict! Congratulations!</p>

            <p>Hello Social Media - BrianK,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; As others have inquired on, what specific application are you having this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the computer creating a restore point, prior to the installation?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>MS TechNet:&nbsp; Application installation goes very slow on Windows 7</span></p>

            <p>I have this problem as of 16/06/2012. It seems that the problem is in Windows 7 64bit. Nero 10 has taken 5 hours up to now and is no where near finished. The computer is not slow, I had to run other programs during the install period &amp; they still worked
 FAST.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would normally not run programs while installing but I needed the work for tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About time Misrosoft fixed this problem as there are a lot of people with the same issue.</p>

<p>I have a program on my computer that I did not put on.&nbsp; It is listed on the title.&nbsp; I understand it is a layering type device that layers web pages and builds up to a large drainage on your computer, among other things.&nbsp; Can&nbsp; you tell me how to get it off
 as I can not remove it on the Add or Remove program screens.&nbsp; I think I saw it when it installed and I did not catch it as it moved to fast.&nbsp; The help listed on the internet has not helped to get it off as of yet.&nbsp;

<br />We immediately blocked all PCs that could be impacted by this issue from being updated, and communicated to customers within 24 hours, including an initial work around.

            <p>Hi ShinGCS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s try these issue diagnosing methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Keep the computer in a clean boot, try to make the changes and check.</p>
<p><span>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please refer to the section: “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot”</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: <span>I would suggest you to uninstall the display driver from the device manager, restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows and X keys</strong> together.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Locate and Expand the <strong>Display Adapter driver</strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Right Click</span></strong><span> on the <strong>Display Device</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Update</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p><span>Ensure that you have installed available Windows updates, including Optional updates. I would also suggest you to install latest chipset drivers by downloading from the computer manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><strong>Download and install drivers: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-faq</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong></p>
<p>You can re-flash the BIOS, this might fix the issue. To know more about flashing the BIOS, refer to the computer manual or contact the computer manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> </span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
 resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend you to go through the <strong>Private message</strong> for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also refer to:</p>
<p>See pictures on the desktop, Start, and the lock screen.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute to the concern why your computer is not able to join the HomeGroup properly. For us to resolve your concern kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from the error message you mentioned, were there any other error messages that showed up when you attempted to connect the laptop to the HomeGroup?</li><li>Are both devices on the same network? If they are, is this through a WiFi connection or LAN connection?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As a initial recommendation, we suggest that to f<span>ollow these steps to run the Windows built in troubleshooter:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">T</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ype<strong> Troubleshooting
</strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Select the <strong>
Troubleshooting&nbsp;</strong>app<strong>.</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Select the <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Look for the&nbsp;<strong>Homegroup</strong> option from the list and select it</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click Next to run the Troubleshooter.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response once you complete the steps.</p>

<p>When I started my computer another day and checking the HomeGroup setting again, it joined the HomeGroup as expected! It, may be, was&nbsp;a&nbsp; temporary flaw with the WiFi networks before....</p>

    <title>Where to upgrade with your code from the old windows7upgradeoption.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> masonweaver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where to upgrade with your code from the old windows7upgradeoption.com &#40;recently had to format hard drive&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I ordered a computer with vista home premium a few years back and paid a little extra to get the windows 7 upgrade when it was released. I just recently had to format my hard drive and do a clean install of windows vista home premium (the only windows
 disks I have). When I got the option to get windows 7 it was only a booklet with the code and web address to download windows 7 and upgrade with that (windows7upgradeoption.com). The website no longer works and I can't find where I am able to get windows 7
 again using the 17 digit code I had gotten from the company I ordeded my computer from. The booklet is a windows booklet and has the "seal" with the 17 digit code on it. I am somewhat annoyed since I did pay an extra 20-30$ at the time to get the upgrade and
 now am unable to get it back after formatting. Any help is much appreciated.

            Your best option is to contact the company from which you purchased your PC and see if they can assist you obtaining a reinstall disc to reinstall Windows 7. The OEM's who provided the upgrade option are responsible for the free upgrade licenses.

            Well I have the key that was used to download/activate it from the windows7upgradeoption.com site, but the site no longer works. Was just hoping there was another way to gain access to it again as I would rather not have to try to find my paperwork from
 the computer I purchased as it is in piles and piles of other papers somewhere.<br />
