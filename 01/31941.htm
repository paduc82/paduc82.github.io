    <title>Recurring Werfault.exe takes up 99&#37; plus of my CPU capacity - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recurring Werfault.exe takes up 99&#37; plus of my CPU capacity</h2>
                    <span>Hi everybody,<br />
                    <span>Hi everybody,<br />
I ran into a problem today with Werfault.exe. It showed up and quickly took up approx 100% of my CPU capacity, leaving me very little to work with (Vista) at a very low speed. I have high speed internet, 2.3 GHz and 4GB RAM.<br />
I went to Control Panel/Syst &amp;Maint/Problem Reports and Solution/Change settings/ advanced settings and turned off Windows Error Reporting for all on the network (desktop and one laptop) and restarted. What do you know : Werfault.exe showed up again in Taskmanager.
<br />
I went to Windows Update, downloaded all there was to download (most not essential), restarted, got my friend Werfault.exe back. Got pretty upset by that time.<br />
Tried all sorts of other things, none effective, but you try in hopes something will work.<br />
Finally, I got into Task Manager again and noticed you can highlight an offending exe&nbsp; and basically dispose of it using the "End Process" button on the bottom of the page, right hand side. As usual, Werfault was there in two lines and shared all my processor
 capacity.<br />
For about 10 minutes, my CPU had some breathing room again after my action in Taskmanager. Then, the first Werfault came back, followed by "SearchIndexer.exe . I did see that before - SearchIndexer will after a brief period be replaced by Werfault.exe and we
 are back to square one.<br />
Obviously, this approach only works a very short period. <br />
It seems not right to turn something off without going for the cause of why the "lovely" Werfault.exe shows up in the first place.
<br />
I looked at some sites on the web, but most do not get any further than "turn off Werfault in the controil panel settings", which I had done before I saw that.<br />
So, I am stuck. Windows O.S. is suffocating my computer by sending reports to Windows. Makes you think about how stubborn the script for this kind of assistance to Microsoft was written.
<br />
OK guys at Microsoft, if there is anybody who knows how to get rid of the cause as well as the symptom of this Error, it must be you. I hope you can help me as soon as possible.<br />

<p>By following Noel's advice, I found the root of the problem rather than bashing away at the symptoms.</p>
<p>Go into the Event Viewer (EVENTVWR.MSC in the search bar). You should start in the Event Viewer (Local).</p>
<p>Top of the page is "Summary of Administrative Events" with a series of Event Types. For me, it shows I had 206 Errors in the last hour, 6000 in the last day... and it got worse after that.</p>
<p>So I expanded the "Error" section, and found the listing that was causing the most errors. For me, it was pretty far down the list, but it had 192 of the 206 errors in the last hour, so I clicked on "Application Error". I double-clicked, and it brought me
 to a new page.</p>
<p>The new page is a description of what's going wrong, but all you REALLY need to do is look at the first line of the big gray box. It'll tell you: "Faulting application BlahBlahBlah.exe" or something. Once you have a name for the perpetrator, you can either
 search your own computer for that and see what it's tied to, or search the internet.</p>
<p>For me, my problem was an nProtect netizen service I picked up while using the internet in Korea. I guess it was freaking out now that I'm no longer in Korea. So I uninstalled the nProtect service and BAM, no more WerFault.exe hogging my resources.</p>
<p>Seriously guys. Look for the source. Your computer is slowing down because of the Windows Reporting, but what error is Windows reporting? Solve THAT problem and you've got it made.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 PIN Sign-in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patmckechnie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PIN Sign-in</h2>
                    <p>My computer recently went in for a warranty repair.&nbsp; While it was there, they re-installed Windows 10.&nbsp; Since then, I have to put in my full Windows password to sign-in, rather than just a PIN, which I would prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into:&nbsp; Settings, Accounts, Sign-in Options, and Clicked the "Add" PIN button, input my full MS password.&nbsp; Then it asks again to verify myself by inputting my PIN.&nbsp; I input the PIN I have used in the past.&nbsp; Without pressing Enter, the text box
 disappears and there is no change to my sign-on options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Hi Pat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the PIN set in an earlier build does not work after reinstalling Windows 10. To better assist you, we'd like clarify few things:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and version of Windows 10 is installed on your computer?</li><li>Which build and version of Windows 10 are you using before reinstalling Windows?</li><li>Have you tried resetting your PIN?</li><li>Did you get any error messages after you verified the PIN you entered?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you follow the steps in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026196/windows-pin-sign-in-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>We appreciate your response. Since you're able to create a new user profile and the issue did not persist, that means the previous user profile when signing in option using PIN was corrupted after Windows 10 was reinstalled. If you wish to use the new user
 profile, since you're able to use the PIN sign-in option, you may transfer your files. If you wish to still use the previews user profile, you may still sign in to it using your full password.</p>

<h2>            The action center is flashing a notification in the task bar to quick to read.</h2>
                    I'm getting a notification from the action center which is to quick to read. It flashes every 6 seconds and there is a X on the action center icon in the task bar. Any idea on how I can stop this&nbsp;constant&nbsp;flashing?

            I did have Eset installed but was having problems with it working on Windows 8 so I switched to ZA free firewall and antivirus, but there was a tool bar installation of AVG which I uninstalled, I'll check and see if there is any other AVG programs installed.

    <title>Outlook.com Folders Empty in Windows Mail AND Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindyedge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com Folders Empty in Windows Mail AND Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have read several similar threads on this but have not found any solution that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Hotmail.com account that I access via Outlook.com. I would like to access it via Windows Mail on my PC but I cannot see the emails in the folders. These are regular folders, not sub-folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I set it up in Windows Mail, the inbox, sent items and drafts all sync just fine. The folder titles sync into Windows Mail but the folders are empty. I tried setting it up in Outlook 2013, and the same thing happened. I tried to manually sync the emails
 in the folders but got the message "We didn't find anything to show here." But if I access the Hotmail.com account online, there are emails in the folders. One suggestion I read elsewhere was to delete&nbsp;the account in Windows mail and recreate it. That didn't
 work. I also saw a suggestion to&nbsp;create a new folder, move the emails into it and it would sync on my PC. I tried that. Again the title synced but there were no emails in the folder and Windows could not find anything to show...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, I would prefer to access this email account via Windows Mail but would use Outlook 2013 if I can't use Window Mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate it very much if someone could provide a solution to this problem.</p>

</p><p>What are&nbsp;your&nbsp;sync duration settings in the Mail app and how long ago did you receive the email in&nbsp;the folders that are not syncing?&nbsp; If you are using the default setting of syncing email from the last month, and the emails in these folders are from more
 than a month ago, the folders will be empty. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can update the sync window duration with the following steps (from <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-Sync-issues-in-Mail-and-Calendar-apps-in-Windows-10-0dd86c69-18f3-4f73-9d3d-375bdc9c3e34?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello Jeanine593,</p>
<p>Most programs are able to be uninstalled by going to Control Panel, Programs and Features. Then highlight the program you want to uninstall, right click and select uninstall.<br />
You can also go to the menu bar at the top and click on uninstall. <br />
<br />
If that is not successfull, you may need to do a search on Internet for a 3rd party software removal utility.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Security update KB3079904 caused all kinds of problems.</h2>
                    Good day,<br />
<br />
Today I was prompted to install security update KB3079904. After installation and rebooting, the installation of the update was succesful, however, my system (Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit) ran into a couple of issues.<br />
<br />
First of all, the antivirus was completely disabled and could not be enabled. (Windows Action Center gave an alert that the antivirus was disabled, so did the program itself)<br />
When trying to manually enable it, or updating it, I received an unusual "acces denied" error. The community of the antivirus software (Avira) said when this happens you should reboot the computer and everything would be fine.(which was not the case)<br />
Apart from that, my Realtek HD Audio was not running either. (it did not appear on the right corner of the task bar, as it normally should) so there was no sound. I went to the Device Manager to check what was going on, but the device manager tab was completely
 blank. (nothing appeared)<br />
So I was pretty sure it was caused by the KB3079904 update. After uninstalling it and rebooting, everything was fine again. So I'm convinced this KB3079904 security update has some issues inside it?<br />
<br />
Thank you and kind regards,<br />
Thomas-N.

            Well, I tried it again, but this time I left the installation to proceed during shutdown in stead of installing first and then shutting down. Everything is working fine so far. Realtek sound system is executed this time and so is the antivirus.<br />
Since 16 other people have pushed the "Me Too" button, I think I'm going to leave this issue unresolved for now, however if I were you I would just uninstall the update and try it over.

            <p>Today, I too&nbsp;was prompted to install security update KB3079904. After installation and rebooting, the installation of the update was succesful, however, my system (Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit) ran into one problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as rebooting had completed I noticed that I wasn't connected to the internet.&nbsp; Upon further inspection the wireless network adapter wasn't functioning.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using an Atheros AR9485WB-EG with a driver version 9.2.0.470.&nbsp; The device status box had
 a message of: </p>
<p>Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code
 52).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been using the wireless network right up to the point of the reboot for the security update so that seems to be when the problem occured.&nbsp; I have now uninstalled that particular security update and reinstalled it with no change in the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; How
 do I get the signature for the driver corrected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>

            My problem is that the update won't even install, I have run the trouble shooter twice. And ran the trouble shooter from the Microsoft web site. restarted the computer and followed all suggestions. at this point I give up on the update. besides in about
 one week I am planning on updating to windows 10 anyhow.

            <p>I also have an issue with this patch on Vista 32 SP2</p>
<p>
</p><p>This got downloaded automatically yesterday and installed successfully but said it needed to restart to complete the change, that went through fine and I got the "Configuring..." message which also completed, but after I restart the system again Vista hangs.<br />
<br />
So... it shows the black Microsoft Corp screen and the green blocks, then it moves to the next stage to start loading proper and remains black, I never get to my Vista screen where it asks me to log on.<br />
<br />
After 10-15mins I give up and power cycle to try again, it fails again.<br />
<br />
Then I start a launch repair, it states it wouldn't start as it has an issue with a patch, does a restore from the restore point and I'm back in business and Vista boots.<br />
<br />
Vista see's I need the KB3079904 update, downloads the update and around we go again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully Microsoft will fix and re-release?</p>

            <p>My version of this issue was very much like these two threads with a Win2k-like screen (was Aero) where the desktop and display graphics struggled, startup/restart/shutdown took forever (Win7 Ultimate SP1):</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/21488611-2011-4242-90a5-ba1f536ca5f6/could-not-connect-to-system-event-notification-service?forum=w7itprogeneral</p>

<p>(see NeoVG's entry)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I disabled the font cache service and that sped up shutdown/restart considerably, but event and desktop/display issues persisted.&nbsp; Did the .dat to .old recommendations - no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had to rollback via restore point - fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At work, also Win7U SP1, same thing but a second restart after update cleared it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update appears to be causing some sort of font-related delay at startup that prevents the event notify service connection and timeouts/disables desktop and display components on some systems.&nbsp; My fresh Win8.1 systems updated fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this update needs an update...</p>

<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2015.07.26</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who can't install this update, there is a workaround:</p>

<p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-078.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, this will disable the vulnerable component:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(in admin command prompt window, i.e., right-click run as admin)</p>
<p>cd "%windir%\system32"<br />
takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll<br />
icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl<br />
icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F) <br />
rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll<br />
(this part is only for 64-bit Windows)</p>
<p>cd "%windir%\syswow64"<br />
takeown.exe /f atmfd.dll<br />
icacls.exe atmfd.dll /save atmfd.dll.acl<br />
icacls.exe atmfd.dll /grant Administrators:(F) <br />
rename atmfd.dll x-atmfd.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did this, restarted, so far, so good...</p>

<p>I had reported this else where but added it here as it follows this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update laptop was slow, could not access many webpages. I could not access GOOGLE (because ti was going to my https page) but could YAHOO. I could NOT access my banking sites. Banking&nbsp; Sites would tell me to clear cache - did not work.&nbsp; I use Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For goggle I get</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was able to use another laptop with no problem that was not updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Firefox. IE or Chrome - none work for https SSL sites.&nbsp; Secure sites are not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled KB3079904 - nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rerolled back to PC with recovery to before the update - nothing happened</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Firefox web site and REFRESHED firefox- Now I can see google mail directly&nbsp; but I still get the error with google itself. Email no longer has the ability to send attachments etc, a lot of stuff is missing. .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Bitdefender, Malwarebytes anit-exploit,&nbsp; and Malware bytes Ant-malware.&nbsp; Same on the other 8.1&nbsp; laptop that work fine that has not been updated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now going to investigate BitDefeneder, and the others if the patch broke any of them.&nbsp; IT SEEMS THAT BITDEFENDER "SCAN SSL" may be causing this based on my experiments. Disabling "SCAN SSL" give me access - I am still testing.&nbsp; I am working with BitDefender.
 SCAN SSL can be disabled with no worries in BitDefender so that at least is a temp fix.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BitDefender indicated it looks like it broke their code for SSL and&nbsp; investigated.&nbsp; Their response was that Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware may be interfering&nbsp; with Bitdefender. SInce the problem happened with the update and turning
 SCAN SSL off solved my problem I am not removing those two programs I value. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut off Bitdefender Anti-spam (which I think is cloud based) and got back the PCs browser speed.&nbsp; So it looks like the MS update screwed that too.

    <title>Weird xbox 360 controller problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tkalec14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird xbox 360 controller problem</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox 360 original wireless controller that came with my slim console has been acting strangely lately.</p>
<p>My problem is that the left analog stick pulls back backwards if I move it even slightly. When I play a game it can pull it back a bit slowing movement or it can pull it backwards really hard that it even stops movement or makes the game character move backwards
 when I actually want to go up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weirdest thing is that it all goes back to normal after a certain period of time. I can play it for two weeks and then all of a sudden it will start pulling backwards for a week and then get back to normal only to do so again two weeks later. That is
 why I know this is not a problem with centering the stick (if it were then it wouldn't get back to normal every once in a while).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has started about 4 months ago all of a sudden, it lasted for one day and it returned later for longer and longer. It would get better at regular intervals and get worse later. It's like a stupid cycle.</p>
<p>I have only just bought New Vegas, played it normally for an hour and all of a sudden it started pulling back backwards a bit, 15 minutes later it got worse. It is so frustrating that I can't even play it normally without raging over the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People seem to have a problem with their controllers pulling to sides because of it failing to center but they don't get better like mine after some time so that is why my problem is unique, I can't find anyone with the same problem. Hopefully, somebody
 knows how to fix this because I can't really play xbox with my stick pulling backwards anymore.</p>

            Hi Catalin,<br />
<br />
We appreciate that you have already performed troubleshooting to resolve the issue. For us to assist you, we suggest that you contact the OEM of your computer because one of the reasons why you're unable to install Windows 10 is that it's not compatible with
 the current settings of your computer.<br />
<br />
If your OEM said that the settings of your computer are compatible, we suggest that you visit this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">
article</a>. From there, you'll see a guide on how to perform a custom install of Windows 10 using a USB.<br />

Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file. An ISO file is a digital replica of a virtual disc, which users will have to make bootable on a blank DVD, USB thumb drive or SD card.">How

            <p>Some people report logging out of iCloud on your Win 10 computer, waiting a bit then logging back into iCloud fixes the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I uninstalled iCloud, then reinstalled iCloud. After that I could sync Outlook 2010 calendar and contacts with iCloud and my iPad and iPhones.</p>

<p>Ok so I pre-ordered Cod: Ghosts, and it came with 2 game add-on's "Free Fall" and the "Season Pass" Free fall worked and the season pas didn't. Who can i talk to so they can test the code or something, cause it's not working for me and i paid $119 for a
 reason to get the season pass and it says "Please enter a valid code" Please get back to me and someway. I'd really like to try to solve this problem. $119 is a lot for "just he the game itself without a valid Season Pass."</p>

<h2>            Windows moving slowly, computer performance slowed. Is there a fix&#63; &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon upgrading to Windows 10, I noticed that the performance of my PC decreased. In what ways you ask?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well for starters, almost every time I move windows around my screen, instead of quickly getting into place, they slowly move which often slows the performance of my computer until they finish moving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, 75% of the time whenever I hover over an opened program in my taskbar, the pop-up menu/window preview slowly opens, and half of the time whenever I click on the preview it doesn't open the program and just goes back to the previous program or shows
 the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to what was stated above, I have a problem with Steam which I believe this issue is due to windows 10. Whenever I get a notification, it slowly comes up, and slowly goes back down. While this is happening, my computer is completely unresponsive
 to everything I do, and continues to freeze up until the notification goes away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any of you know how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Changing the background scene on the sign-in screen</h2>
                    <p>I want to change the background scene on my sign-in screen. The current one showed up during the holiday season but it hasn't changed since the holidays ended. I did not choose the current scene but I know it came from the Magic Jigsaw Puzzles app. which
 I&nbsp;use daily.&nbsp;Is this scene&nbsp;something that Microsoft controls? I went to&nbsp;Personalized Settings from the startup menu but can't find anything related to the sign-in screen, just how to change my desk top scenes which I do not want to change. I've also noticed
 that other members have asked questions about this&nbsp;same issue but so far no one has come up with a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10 lets you use the lock screen picture as the background picture of the sign-in screen. For you to change the picture on your sign-in screen, you need to change your
<strong>Lock screen</strong> picture first, see steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Personalization</strong>.</li><li>Under<strong> Background </strong>section, click on the drop down and choose <strong>

    <title>Xbox Game Pass PC App - Crash after Login - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Game Pass PC App - Crash after Login</h2>
                    <p>I've downloaded the Xbox Game Pass PC App on the day it was announced and have installed two games. Since two weeks I noticed, that I'm no longer logged into my account, but I could continue to play the games. Today I wanted to download another game and
 I can't because I'm not logged in. If I try to log in, everything works fine until I finally click on "Play now" (Jetzt spiele in german, I don't know the exact name of the english button). After I click this, the App wents black and doesn't work anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close it and reopen it, I'm not logged in. I've reinstalled the app - same problem. I've installed the "Xbox Identity Provider" - same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use the game pass anymore and I hope someone here has an idea...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>no, I think you misunderstood my problem. The Xbox Game Pass App simply crashes everytime I log in. I choose my account, click on Ok and the whole App window wents black and doesn't respond anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows is up to date and I know the forum thread you talked about. I installed the Xbox Identity Provider app as suggested in this thread but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also submitted a feedback via the Game Pass App about two weeks ago including a video with the error recorded. But I didn't get any response.</p>

<h2>            my Family Tree Maker version 6 2005 will not run in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have recently set up a local network with my husband's computer which is running Windows XP. He has our version 6 Family Tree Maker 2005 installed and I wish to access it from my new computer which is running Windows 7. I have installed Family Tree Maker
 from the original CD (the same one which we used to install it on his machine originally) but when I try to open our Family File via the network I keep getting the message ' The file you are trying to load is from a newer version of Family Tree Maker and cannot
 be loaded. To upgrade call 1-800-548-1806 (a US number). I should not have to update anything because the two installations of the program should be the same. Help!

            This is just a thought -- is it possible that sometime after you installed version 6 2005 on the XP machine that an update of some type was downloaded or installed to it and that is therefore in fact newer than what is on your disk that you installed to
 the Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; Most software shows the detailed version number by going to a Help menu and choosing an About item.&nbsp; You might try that on both to see if the versions are in fact the same.&nbsp; As you may be aware, they have a support site but it likely
 won't be of much use for the 2005 version:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.familytreemaker.com/Support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Compressed files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files. You can work with compressed files and folders in the same way that you work with uncompressed files and folders. You can also combine
 several files into a single compressed folder, making it easier to share a group of files, since you only need to attach one folder to an e‚Äëmail message instead of several files<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Vista has built-in ZIP support and if you need more use 7-zip which is free.<br />
<br />
7-ZIP - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.7-zip.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Will you get double Notepad entries for all file types, or just .txt files?</p>
<p>(Could be that you have registered Notepad as an app for handling all file types (I have, it can be handy) - and that this has somehow been registered twice)</p>

<p>In addition, this error also comes up anytime I try to open the control panel or its associated applications (so I can't mess around with any settings, or get my ID number for chat support). However, I can still browse through folders using other programs.
 I vaguely remember my action center saying something yesterday about my computer needing to restart before User Account Control could be turned on. I've had UAC turned off since I got the computer. There is only one user profile and it has no password. Running
 Windows 7 Ultimate; just upgraded two weeks ago from Vista.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;Any recent hardwares/softwares changes made on your computer?</div>
<div><br />
Let‚Äôs try the below methods and check.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>You may also temporarily disable security software‚Äôs and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable those security software's on the computer after checking.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></div>
<div><br />
If disabling the security software resolves the issue then, please contact the specific security software manufacturer to resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Important</strong> These steps may increase your security risk. These steps may also make the computer or the network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. We recommend the process that this article describes
 to enable programs to operate as they are designed to or to implement specific program capabilities. Before you make these changes, we recommend that you evaluate the risks that are associated with implementing this process in your particular environment.
 If you decide to implement this process, take any appropriate additional steps to help protect the system. We recommend that you use this process only if you really require this process.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>You may try creating a new user account and check if the issue persists there.<br />
If you are unable to open Control Panel to create a new user account then, try creating it in safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Create a user account<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it works in a new user account then you need to fix the corrupt user profile. You may visit this link for the steps:<br />

<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 3: </strong>Check if the issue persists in safe mode and post back the same.<br />

            Hi dan6260, please try this:
<br />
<br />Click the links below to download the 3 troubleshooters for Windows Media player
<br />
<br />Then run each one individually, once that is done, check whether WMP is working correctly:

            Hi Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You dont' have to use WMP.  Most enthusiasts also have the more respected player VLC installed so they can use it to play DVD's for free (without buying a player) or to pick up the many file types WMP can't play.  It's just as good or better.  <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>
<br />
<br />You can troubleshoot WMP here:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-tips-for-windows-media-player-2438908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-tips-f...</a>
<br />
<br />Do you have any other performance issues?  How long ago was the last Clean Install - not Reset or Start Fresh, but an actual wipe of the drive and reinstall which is the only install enthusiasts will run on Windows 10 where the quality of the install is what's most important?

            Then the files may be corrupted.  Download some new files to test this.  
<br />
<br />The only reason both would not work is if the install is heavily corrupted.  Do you have other performance problems?  If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I'm currently in japan and Have a U.S. system, on militayy base.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to download lets say something on Games on demand I get the "Not avaliable in your location"
</p>
<p>I know I can't download them due to being in japan, but i'll be going to germany soon for another while and have no idea when I will return to the U.S.</p>
<p>is there anyway around this? becoming more of a pain being able to not download anything.</p>

<p>most Games of demand games shouldn't be region locked except the few call of duty waw and blackops and gears of war 1-2 ( you won't get them in germany) and halo comes to mind</p>
<p>no there is no way around the region lock</p>
<p>you can however make a local account for the correct region and download the games as you wish</p>
<p>although you can buy those games on disks however the DLC would be region locked</p>

<p>yep you cannot get region locked content outside of the region they are set in you must wait till you return to the us and get a US connection</p>
<p>this is why you buy the disks versions</p>
<p>unless you are talking about DLC addons there is no way to get region locked content outside of their regions its not a bug
