<h2>            Hacked Windows 8 has BLACK SCREEN after rebooting after AVG SOFTWARE TOLD ME TO</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba PC / TV thing and it originally had Windows 7 but I hacked Windows 8 onto it in 2k13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other day I ran an avg scan and removed a lot of viruses and it told me I had to restart (probs to kill more viruses) so did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an I turned the PC back on the login screen/ start up screen was working except normal wallpaper was replaced with blue. When I log into the main account, the desktop is black except for the desktop icons bar thingy at the bottom? And then it would
 suddenly log itself out an return to the logon / start up screen. It doesn't log itself out on other accounts but the black screen is still there .</p>
<p>
</p><p>and I can't get onto safe mode etc. because the power button does nothing when I click on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let‚Äôs try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section ‚Äú<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting‚Äù</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I</span><span>&nbsp;would also suggest you to refer to the article given below and check if that helps.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2756559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2756559</span></span></a></span></span></p>

    <title>Trackpad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tannerveis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trackpad</h2>
                    <p>The bottom of the trackpad on the Surface Laptop I purchased in August has popped out the trackpad still works for the most past. The small metal piece I assume holds it in has popped out, the top is still connected. I am uncertain where to take this to
 have it fixed as mailing it at this time in Grad School is something I cannot afford time wise as a distance learner. I live in Havre, MT. Any thoughts to getting this issue resolved?</p>

<p>I live in Montana and unfortunately there is no Microsoft store in the 4th largest state.&nbsp; I would have to fly or drive over 8 hours to the closest store. Any other recommendations or does Microsoft ship a box I can send the laptop back to them to get fixed?</p>

            Under the "device service &amp; repair" the closest I could get to be able to send in my surface 1 laptop to be fixed would cost me $450.00 as I assume the aforementioned description of the issue fits under physical damage only. I am disappointed in Microsoft
 if this is the only way I can have a 2-3 month old laptop fixed. Is there another solution I am not seeing in the article provided?

<h2>            Problems with Windows 10 Apps and getting error code 0x8007003 while updating apps.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Problems with Windows 10 Apps</p>
<p>Just got a new laptop preloaded with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked fine for about a day or so, but then it started having problems with Apps.&nbsp; The Windows Store has display issues, the Calculator and Alarm Apps would not install updates (error code 0x8007003) and will not open.&nbsp; The Netflix App ("Sorry there was
 a problem communicating with Netflix.&nbsp; Please try again.") and Roku App (can not detect any devices on the network even when I manually enter the device's IP address) do not work either, and I know it is the apps that are not working because Netflix works
 fine when I visit the site through my web browser and I can even project my screen using via the Roku device and the Roku app for my phone works fine.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling the apps and then reinstalling them, but it did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the troubleshooter on the Windows Store and cleared the cache and neither accomplished anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought perhaps the problem was that I downloaded a problematic Windows Update so I used the recovery tool to go back to a previous build of Windows 10 just to see what would happen.&nbsp; It actually fixed all the issues I was having... for about 24 hours
 at which point they returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can try or should I just return/exchange the laptop.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The exact status is that the&nbsp; Alarm and Clock app will not open and is generating an error when it attempts to update through the Windows Store.&nbsp; The Windows Store is having display issues (specifically not showing app icons or screenshots).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Netflix
 app can not communicate with Netflix.&nbsp; The Roku app can not detect any devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test, I set up another user account and using the other account I was able to get the Calculator app to work (and it is now working for all users for the time being at least), but Windows Store, Alarm, Netflix and Roku apps experienced the same problems
 they did when I was logged in as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Windows Updates have been installed and it appears all drivers are up to date.</p>

            This did not work unfortunately. I also attempted to reset the PC and was told I needed a recovery drive/system restore disk. I attempted to make one, but Windows would not allow it.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your response with the current status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the below steps and check if it helps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I suggest you to disconnect all external devices connected to your system, and then try to create Windows 10 Installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <span>Disconnect all peripheral devices except for Keyboard and Mouse.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2</strong>: I recommend you to uninstall&nbsp;the&nbsp;third party security software from the computer and try to create a new media creation tool.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disable Anti virus:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it
 to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Also try to start Windows Installer services and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press <strong>Windows Key + R Key.</strong></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Type <strong>‚Äúservices.msc</strong>‚Äù without the quotes in the run box and hit on
<strong>Enter Key</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Search for <strong>Windows installer.</strong></p>
<p>4. Double click on it and under <strong>Startup type</strong>, select <strong>
Automatic.</strong></p>
<p>5. Then click on <strong>Start.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p>6. Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and click on <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;If you are still not able to create Media Creation&nbsp;Disk, then try to create Windows 10 Installation disk from another computer. Then try to&nbsp;perform Reset of the computer.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 upgrade - why am I forced to create and account and provide sensitive data like date of birth&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
I just upgraded my Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. After the installation I was forced to create an outlook account. I've been asked to provide my date of birth.
<u>This is sensitive information I use when contacting my bank to verify my identity</u>, so why am I forced to provide that information? I do not trust any company to hold that kind of data on me. I think this kind of policy should stop and I should have the
 option to opt out from creating an account. I only have one laptop at home with Windows, I don't use Facebook, I don't use Twitter, I don't share my picture all over the Internet, I don't even want to send my stuff to the cloud as it's not safe and never will
 be, not even backups. I don't have a smartphone, nor tablet to be online all my life. By the way, if I wanted to access my pictures or documents at work, I am blocked by administrators anyway, so I don't have access to my files where I most need them.<br />
<br />
By the way, I don't need YET another email account, I already use 4 non-Microsoft mailboxes, one for work, two free mailboxes and one from my Internet provider. YET another email account to use for companies to send spam.<br />
<br />
I hope this will be taken into consideration. <br />
Regards,<br />
Richlion2<br />

            Just Wonderful!!!  MS has forced me to upgrade my 8.0 to 8.1.  As a result I had to create a MS account which I will not use if I have a choice.  Secondly, I now have to enter a pass word.  Now, if only the computer would boot up correctly.  All I get is a flashing light blue and dark blue screen and, occasionally, my desk top for maybe a second or two.  As I look at this in retrospect of the three PCs that I purchased during the past six months, why did I take a chance on buying one 8.0 instead of all 7's?  ****.

            Nobody has forced you to update to 8.1. You could have remained on 8.0 and even received updates until November of 2015. You can remain on 8.0 even after that just without updates. &nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be
 glad to assist you.

            <p>I was forced to upgrade, because that's what my system did before I managed to login to the system. It DID NOT work the way I expected it to do :
</p>
<p>- let me login to the system</p>
<p>- let me choose to upgrade</p>
<p>- tell me what is the process and what I will need to do the upgrade and do I agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I switched my computer on in my case Windows simply said "do not shut down your computer, update is in progress", then it asked me to create an email account. And that is what my subject was about. Read my post carefully before responding.</p>

            You're thinking of the previous screen.&nbsp; If you said you wanted to 'create a new account', it would have offered you the choice (seen above) of making a local or a Microsoft account.&nbsp; I guess you decided to sign-in to an existing account instead.&nbsp; If you
 want to reverse that choice, you can just go to the PC Settings under accounts and click "disconnect".&nbsp; Nothing is ever forced on you, even if you made the wrong choice before you can always undo it.

<h2>            Windows update deleted Norton and will not allow reinstallation. How long can one operate in Safe Mode&#63; Ramifications of this&#63;</h2>
                    I have spoken numerous times with Norton. System restore was successful a couple of times, but Norton that was in place&nbsp;during that time no longer shows up. I am operating only in safe mode and am not sure how that works, either; it's very limiting.&nbsp; IT
 geeks have determined there's no virus or hard drive damange.&nbsp;The computer is unbelievably slow without safe mode, too much so to operate.&nbsp; This all began mid-October with a Windows update.&nbsp; Norton was reinstalled and worked for a few weeks until another Windows
 update.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and reinstalled Norton until I am blue in the face and it's still wonky.&nbsp; Any help and suggestions would be so appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks ~

            <p>Hi TaraYA,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What happens when you try to install Norton?</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Update does not delete any security program. However, you may check for the program installed on the computer or not?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following article to search for a file or folder:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista,
 and just serves as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft
 to make this available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.<br />

<p>Hi, i have a problem with my Windows 10 XBOX App. I connect my Xbox One in the App correctly, but when i'm tryin to start stream in app appears message "Connecting" (on green screen) and after 2-3 sec. app is crashing. In same time

<h2>            Windows updates pissing me off.</h2>
                    Not sure what to do but windows 10 updates are pissing me off. This is the second time I had to wait for an update to install when I desperately needed to use my laptop to make final bid on ebay and loosing because my laptop decided to update right at
 that moment. &nbsp;This is also the third time my laptop is all screwed up again after an update. &nbsp;What would happen is after an update my Pin would stop wotking on boot up and I could only log on using Microsoft password. &nbsp;I would also get random freeze ups and
 blue screens. &nbsp;Microsoft support is absolutely useless in correcting problem even to the point where I allow them remote access to my laptop. The problem would seem to correct itself after 2-4 updates and it would be working great again. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi Ishan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>Did you perform Startup Repair or Repair upgrade using the ISO?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to boot&nbsp;the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists.
<span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device
 drivers aren't causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</a>&nbsp;<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>If the issue&nbsp;does not persist in&nbsp;Safe Mode, perform a Clean&nbsp;Boot. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">*
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>

            Hi Gary,
<br />
<br />When all else fails, the manual approach is your best option to transfer the files, the built in Photos App can be a bit unreliable, and you will have more control over the files are transferred . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows Fie Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar) 
<br />
<br />On the left click 'This PC' 
<br />
<br />On the right double click your device or the DCIM folder (whichever shows up) 
<br />
<br />Then simple select the files you want to transfer and drag them into the Pictures folder in the left pane of File Explorer 
<br />
<br />That's it!       
        </p>

            Hi Nicola
<br />
<br />Any printer that is Windows 10 compatible and suits your needs and budget will be fine.
<br />
<br />There is no specific printer that is better than the other for Windows 10, the HP Deskjet 3762 id reliable, cheap, has wireless capability and good print quality, so yes, no problem with that printer for use with Windows 10 . . .

 The auto responder tells me in robot voice: "The number you have dialed is unallocated". So weird. All the numbers are the same. What's wrong with Skype!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was calling to Mobile numbers using my subscription. It wasn't working between 4-11PM yesterday. I tried with my android phone and windows 10 laptop. The robot like voice responded and stopped my calls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this morning, it looks like you fixed the issue and I was able to make a call. It was so weird having such a problem for so many hours and couldn't contact with support to report the issue. I needed to make calls urgently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most people I know avoid using skype these days. But I like Skype and keep using it. Feels like now I understand why others don't use. It seems worth considering looking for different service providers. So upset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I can make my next calls without any issues.</p>

<h2>            chkdsk stops on external WD drive</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm having problems with one of my external WD drive. There are a bunch of files that cannot be accessed. So I ran chkdsk about 3 times. It slowed down considerably at about 52% (see output below). After a while, about 15 minutes, chkdsk reports an error at
 some index and attempts to fix it. But I notice that it does not say that it went on to 100 percent on checking the indexes. I've already ran it several times with the same result. What should I do?<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32&gt;chkdsk H: /F<br />
The type of the file system is NTFS.<br />
Volume label is My-Passport-Backup-1 .<br />

            Hi BrianKarnes,
<br />
<br />I hope you are having a good day. Here's some information that can help you.
<br />
<br />You must verify the following
<br />
<br />1- Check SD card slot of the computer with Windows 10. If the SD card is not recognized in Windows 10, but when inserting it in another computer it appears, in this case you must first check the SD card slot is that the reader cards works on another computer. To check if the problem results from the hardware part of the slot, you can insert the SD card into a USB card reader and connect it to the USB port to see if you can access the data in it. Of course, you can connect another SD card in the SD card slot to check the status.
<br />
<br />2- Update Driver
<br />As the drivers are updated from time to time, you need to go to the computer manufacturer's website to download and install the latest drivers for the SD card. Once this is done, restart your computer and check if it works.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />3- Execute hardware troubleshooting
<br />Connect the SD card and follow the steps below to execute the troubleshooting of hardware.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />- Enter the troubleshooting in the search box and then press Enter
<br />- Click on Hardware and sound&gt; Hardware and devices.
<br />- Follow the instructions on the screen. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.
<br />
<br />Please, let me know if this was useful or if you need additional assistance.
<br />- David
