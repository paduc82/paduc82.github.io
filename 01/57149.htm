<h2>            Boring achievements</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone else wish EPIC (and other developers) would come up with some better achievements?&nbsp; It seems like most of the achievements for the DLC are just grinding: win 10 matches with this skin, win 10 matches with that skin, execute this guy 10x with
 this skin, &nbsp;start over at 100, ok now do it again.&nbsp; I'm not a completionist, but I like Gears and really enjoyed getting 100% on Gears 2, but I just can't get excited about grinding these out and I hate boosting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do wish they would get a little more creative and I also wish they wouldn't give so many points for easy achievements. Example complete a boss wave on hardcore with all Onyx Guards 75 points this should have been 10-15 points at most.</p>

<p>The 100G for the Onyx Guard in horde was a bit much. For 100G they could have done something like "As Prescott lead the Onyx guard to victory in horde" be it waves 1-10 or even 1-50 with 1 Prescott and 4 Onyx guard</p>

<p>To the Original poster, I know what you're saying. &nbsp;I am not a die hard completionist myself. &nbsp;I love this game even more now that a friend of mine has gotten me back into it as I was playing a lot of MW3. &nbsp;Killing 6,000 people just to receive an Onyx Skin
 for your weapons is a bit extreme. &nbsp;It probably wouldn't be so bad if horde mode, beast, story, and so on were counted to instead of just versus. &nbsp;I personally like versus, only when you don't get a group of people that have to have the mindset of a 2 years
 old if they lose, especially if they win. &nbsp;Friends of mine and I faced a guy yesterday evening that was already a re-up at the rank of 76. &nbsp;We naturally lost to him and his entire team of re-ups, and all her did after the match was tell us how much we sucked
 and we shouldn't even play the game. &nbsp;That kind of stuff really wants me to keep playing this game on versus to complete my challenges and such. &nbsp;They need to come up with some better achievements for people that don't want to spend their time hoping they
 get in a match with people of the right character skin.</p>

<h2>            I need help with adjusting the color with the &#39;Calibrate display color&#39; function of Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I know how to do the brightness and contrast but when I get to the color part I don't know how to tell when it looks best. It says to move the red, green, and blue sliders to remove any color cast from the bars but the bars are all on full right now and
 I don't notice any. Moving them it''s hard to tell with out being able to compare it to something.</p>
<p>&nbsp; My monitor was precalibrated but is over a year old so I'm sure it's changed slightly. Is there a better way of doing this without sending it in to have it professionally done?</p>

            <p>I think I know what you are asking for. It would have to be a new 'feature'. (use the search button on your computer and&nbsp;type&nbsp;'windows feedback'. That should find the feedback application for you if you would like to request the feature.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that you have your lock screen set to 'Windows Spotlight'. These images are taken from Bing. I was unable to find the 'originals' which would most likely have the credit information you want but I assume that as time goes on they will provide
 a link much like the Bing home page does now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO: The link that was provided&nbsp;by Sachin&nbsp;is more for Windows Insiders. I do not think you want to go that route.</p>

            <p>These photos are under the "Windows Spotlight" program that comes with Windows 10 for the lock screen. The photos are located and can be copied from/using the following instructions:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I too wish Microsoft just had a place where we could go to see the images displayed and the information about each photo available. I'm okay with not having them the second I want the info, but it would be nice if Microsoft was more direct in the honesty
 and straight forwardness of their answers. Maybe one day **** will freeze over. Sorry for the sarcasm....</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Store - cant install any apps - error 0x80070005</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try and install apps from the Windows 10 Store I receive the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p>Try that again</p>
<p>Something went wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code was 0x80070005, in case you need it.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried:</p>
<p>- Running the windows app troubleshoot - which returned no errors</p>
<p>- Running WSReset - which completed, but did not resolve the problem</p>
<p>- Checked and turned off proxy settings - same problem</p>
<p>- Created a new administration user and tried to install apps using the new user - same problem</p>
<p>- Change permissions packages in the local app folder - same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously been able to install apps, so I am at a loss as to what has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<ol>
<li>Which app are you trying to install? Any, specifically Facebook, Ebay, just also tried randomly Sticky Notes 8, TaskMe and Microsoft Lync all with the same result.&nbsp;</li><li>Which troubleshooter did you try? this one http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</li><li>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue? Nothing that I remember specifically causing this issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1 - I don't have any 3rd party anti virus</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2 - Completed with no errors:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>"</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;sfc /scannow</p>
<div>Beginning system scan.&nbsp; This process will take some time.</div>
<div>Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.</div>
<div>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</div>
<p>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step&nbsp; 3:</p>
<ol>
<li>My PC is up to date, checked in control panel</li><li>It isn't blocked my windows firewall</li><li>There is no sys admin, I am administrator of my computer</li><li>I cant find any was of syncing app licenses, this doesn't seem to apply to windows 10</li><li>I cant re-install apps as I cant install apps</li><li>I don't know which app publisher to contact as no apps install.</li></ol>

<h2>            Request Timed Out on games</h2>
                    I keep getting the "Request Timed Out" message when I try to play any online/multiplayer games I downloaded from the Microsoft Store (e.g. Dead Rivals - Zombie MMO). I can access the internet just fine, it's only the games that give me problems. I've tried
 all the Command Prompt commands and none of them worked. I also tried temporarily turning off my firewalls and disconnecting from my WIFI network then connecting again; as well as uninstalling the game and reinstalling. Is there anything else I can try?

    <title>Warum ich Microsoft &#40;nicht mehr&#41; liebe &#91;Edit - - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Warum ich Microsoft &#40;nicht mehr&#41; liebe  &#91;Edit - Translation&#93; - Why I love Microsoft &#40;not anymore&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Viele Jahre hatte ich ein Live-Konto mit meiner eigenen E-Mail Adresse (also eigene Domain, nichts bei MS direkt). Urplötzlich wurde das Passwort nicht mehr akzeptiert (dank Passwortmanager gab es niemals eine Fehleingabe) und das Konto war nicht mehr zugänglich.
 Das kennen einige vielleicht aus der Vergangenheit, sonst mal bei Google suchen, da gibt es tausende Verweise seit Jahren. Damals hatte man einfach das Passwort zurückgesetzt. Wahrscheinlich gab es nur einen Fehler in der Datenbank von Microsoft. Passierte
 hier und da öfter in all den Jahren und war nervig aber kein Halsbruch. Microsoft hatte damals einen Link an die E-Mail Adresse geschickt, den hat man angeklickt und konnte sich ein neues Passwort festlegen. Ging einigermaßen fix, wenn die Microsoft Mailserver
 nicht mal wieder völlig überlastet waren, denn dauerte die E-Mail schon mal 2 Tage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Die Zeiten scheinen sich geändert zu haben. Mittlerweile geht es nicht mehr so einfach. Man muss sich nun mit vielen persönlichen Daten verifizieren. Schlimm genug, daß man als Nutzer so etwas machen muss, wenn Microsoft einfach mal so das Passwort zurücksetzt
 aber kann man auch noch akzeptieren.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nicht akzeptieren kann ich die neuste Masche von Microsoft:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blockierung von Konten. Mein Konto, was ich sehr viele Jahre nutze, wurde von heute auf morgen gesperrt. Entsperrung nicht möglich, da mich Microsoft nicht verifizieren kann. Äh ja, ist klar. Als ich den Mailsupport gebeten habe mein Konto zu löschen wurde
 es abgelehnt. Auf den Hinweis, dass ich laut neuem Datenschutzgesetz jederzeit um
<strong>Löschung aller meiner Daten</strong>&nbsp;bitten kann, wurde ich gebeten von weiteren Anfragen Abstand zu nehmen. Eine Beschwerde bei dem Datenschutzbeauftragten von Microsoft brachte übrigens niemals eine Rückmeldung. Da kann man nur erahnen, was MS für
 Daten alles bunkert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>GOTT SEI DANK hab ich das Konto nie professionell genutzt. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ich hab mir dann (eigene Dummheit) eine XBox gekauft, da es die im Super-Angebot gab (nun weiß ich auch wieso) und mir ehrlich gesagt keine weiteren Gedanken mehr gemacht, dass es vielleicht normal bei Microsoft ist. Als ich sie erhalten habe, neues Konto
 eingerichtet (wieder mit meiner eigenen Domain, nur halt eine andere E-Mail Adresse). Klappte problemlos, XBox Live Spieleabo für ~50 Euro bestellt oder wie sich das nennt. Alles gut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dann bin ich auf die Idee gekommen, die XBox zu einem Freund mitzunehmen. Wohnt im gleichen Ort. Abgestöpselt, angestöpselt, neues WLAN Netzwerk mühsam konfiguriert und dann auf mein Live-Konto "geklickt". Auf einmal eine Passworteingabe erforderlich. "Nanu
 "dachte ich mir. Passwort eingetippt und tada. Es wurde nicht akzeptiert. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Leichte Panik brach aus, aber kein Problem, ich hab ja glücklicherweise alle Dateien dabei gehabt. Passwort wäre dennoch falsch. Nach mehreren Versuchen hab ich dann die "Passwort vergessen" Option gewählt, die letztendlich ja falsch ist, denn ich hab das
 Passwort ja nie vergessen gehabt. Ich musste meine Handynummer eintippen. "Fehler. SMS kann nicht versendet werden" sowie&nbsp; "Ungültige Anforderung. Versuchen Sie es noch einmal.". Immer wieder abwechselnd.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mehrfach probiert, keine Chance, funktionierte einfach nicht.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also vom Handy aus probiert&nbsp;https://account.live.com zu öffnen und anzumelden. Das Passwort wurde dort komischerweise akzeptiert, allerdings gab es nun einen neuen Fehler. Das Konto ist gesperrt, da ich gegen die Microsoft TOS verstossen habe und SPAM versendet
 hab. Äh. Zur Erinnerung: Ich hab eine eigene Domain, keine Mailadresse bei Microsoft, benutze auch nicht deren Mailserver oder sonstige Dienste. Wie kann ich dann Spam verschickt haben?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Muss zugeben, da war ich auf 180, denn der ganze Abend war ruiniert und das Live-Abo läuft ja für nichts. Kontowiederherstellungsformular augefüllt, nach 48 Stunden eine Standard Antwort erhalten, dass man mich nicht authenfizieren könnte, der Fall für Microsoft
 geschlossen ist und ich von weiteren Fragen absehen möchte. Hab übrigens sogar die Xbox Seriennummer bei der Kontowiederherstellung hinterlegt, wenn das nicht reicht, muss man davon ausgehen, dass Microsoft wirklich
<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">vorsetzlich</span></strong>&nbsp;Konten sperrt um Geld für Abos zu kassieren und dafür keine Gegenleistung zu erbringen. Man stelle sich mal vor, dass ich 20 Spiele im MS Store gekauft habe. Schlimm genug, daß 50 Euro für die
 Jahresgebühr im Mülleimer gelandet sind...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nun kommt der witzigste Teil, der beweist, daß es nicht nur "ein doofer Zufall ist" XBox hab ich VERSCHENKT... neuer Inhaber &gt; NEUES Konto. IDENTISCHES PROBLEM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>DANKE MICROSOFT. </p>

<strong>For many years I had a live account with my own e-mail address (ie own domain, nothing directly with MS). All of a sudden, the password was no longer accepted (thanks to password manager, there was never a mistake) and the account was no longer accessible.
 Some may know this from the past, otherwise look at Google, there are thousands of references for years. At that time, you simply reset the password. There probably was only one mistake in the database of Microsoft. Passed here and there more often in all
 the years and was annoying but no broken neck. At that time Microsoft had sent a link to the e-mail address, they clicked on it and could set a new password. Went to some extent fixed, if the Microsoft Mailservern were not again completely overloaded, because
 the e-mail ever 2 days.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The times seem to have changed. It's not that easy anymore. You now have to verify yourself with a lot of personal data. Bad enough that you have to do something like that as a user, if Microsoft simply resets the password but you can still accept it.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I can not accept the latest scam from Microsoft:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Blocking of accounts. My account, which I have been using for many years, has been blocked from one day to the next. Unlocking not possible because Microsoft can not verify me. Uh yes, it's clear. When I asked the mail support to delete my account it
 was rejected. On the hint that I can ask for deletion of all my data at any time according to new data protection law, I was asked to refrain from further inquiries. Incidentally, a complaint to the Microsoft Data Protection Officer never brought any feedback.
 Since one can only guess what MS bunkert everything for data.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>GOD THANKS I've never used the account professionally.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I then bought (own stupidity) an XBox, as it was in the super offer (now I know why) and I honestly made no further thought that it may be normal for Microsoft. When I received it, I set up a new account (again with my own domain, just a different e-mail
 address). Folded easily, XBox Live Spieleabo ordered for ~ 50 € or whatever that is called. All good.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Then I came up with the idea to take the XBox to a friend. Lives in the same place. Plugged off, plugged in, new Wi-Fi network laboriously configured and then "clicked" on my live account. At once a password required. "Nanu," I thought to myself. Password
 typed in and tada. It was not accepted.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Slight panic broke out, but no problem, luckily I had all the files with me. Password would still be wrong. After several attempts, I then chose the "forgot password" option, which is ultimately wrong, because I've never forgotten the password. I had
 to type in my mobile number. "Error, SMS can not be sent" and "Invalid request. Please try again.". Alternating again and again.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Tried several times, no chance, just did not work.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>So from the phone try https://account.live.com to open and login. The password was strangely accepted there, but there was a new mistake. The account is suspended because I violated Microsoft TOS and shipped SPAM. Uh. Reminder: I have my own domain,
 no mail address at Microsoft, do not use their mail server or other services. How can I have sent spam then?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I have to admit, I was at 180, because the whole evening was ruined and the live subscription runs for nothing. After completing the account recovery form, after 48 hours I received a standard reply that I could not be authenfected, the case is closed
 for Microsoft and I want to refrain from further questions. By the way, even the Xbox serial number deposited with the account recovery, if that is not enough, one must assume that Microsoft locks really vorvolllich accounts to cash for subscriptions to cash
 and provide no return. Just imagine that I bought 20 games in the MS Store. Bad enough that 50 euros for the annual fee have landed in the trash can …</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Now comes the funniest part that proves that it's not just "a silly coincidence" XBox I GOT ... new owner&gt; NEW account. IDENTICAL PROBLEM.</strong></span></strong></p>
<div>
<p><span><br />
<strong>THANK YOU MICROSOFT.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>By the way, answer is no longer required. The post should serve as an info for others, so that everyone is thinking BEFORE buying, whether he / she wants to enter the risk of losing everything.</strong></span></p>

    <title>Seagate Expansion 1TB turns my Xbox One off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meowzed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Seagate Expansion 1TB turns my Xbox One off</h2>
                    <p>About a a year ago I bought a Seagate Expansion 1 TB&nbsp;USB 3.0 Portable 2.5 Inch External Hard Drive for PC,&nbsp;Xbox One and PS4. I have always used this Memory Expansion for Xbox One games and nothing else. For the past year I have used this fine until 05/11/17 (last Sunday), where my Xbox One would shut down after 5 seconds. This would occur&nbsp;once&nbsp;I switched it on and had reached the green loading screen.&nbsp;I tried switching the Xbox One on&nbsp;without the Memory&nbsp;Expansion and it suddenly&nbsp;worked fine. But once a plugged in the Memory Expansion to the Xbox One, the Xbox One would switch itself off again without warning.&nbsp;Is this a new bug with the&nbsp;new update or something?</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<div>I was just trying to get a pre environment idea of the </div>
<br />
<div>computer prior to the issue, as to check if the issue was caused by a third party program or any recent change made to the computer.</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>There might be several reasons why the video won’t play in a specified aspect ratio,</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>a. The video encoded will not support the aspect ratio.</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>b. The monitor resolution and computer settings, while content is played in full screen mode.</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>c. Unsupported video codec to play in desired mode.</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>d. The video file may not be in its original format.</div>
<br />
<br />
<div>Please refer to the Hotfix that you enquired about. However it is for a specific file.</div>
<br />
<br />
<div><strong>The aspect ratio of an ASF file is lost when you try to select a different audio stream for the file in Windows Media Player in Windows 7 or in Windows Vista</strong></div>

            The current Skype TX client requires Windows 8 or above. It will not let you install it on an older OS. Even if you were to force it to install, it would not be usable since the current client and its services are incompatible with older OSes.

            Hi 
<br />
<br />That refurb key is similar to an OEM license, which does not have any transfer rights. 
<br />
<br />
<br />When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?
<br />
<br />If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing too.
<br />
<br />If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.
<br />
<br />If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.
<br />
<br />Full version (Retail):
<br />
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />
<br />- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />
<br />- Expensive
<br />
<br />Upgrade version (Retail):
<br />
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />
<br />- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />
<br />- Expensive, but cheaper than full version
<br />
<br />OEM :
<br />
<br />OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:
<br />
<br />- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel
<br />
<br />- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on
<br />
<br />- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard
<br />
<br />- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system
<br />
<br />What happens if I change my motherboard?
<br />
<br />As it pertains to the OEM license this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail Windows 10 license. If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
<br />
<br />From the Windows 10 end user license agreement:
<br />
<br />b. Stand-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.

            Hi Rihards. <br />
<br />
OEM keys are not moveable, they can be used only on the device, where the system was pre-installed.
<br />
<br />
If you would like to have moveable key, this key should be bougth separetely (box version) and could be move from one device to another.
<br />

<h2>            LifeCam software</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I've updated my system to Windows 10 64bit .&nbsp;My LifeCam Studio was installed correctly, but I can't install the control software (ver, 4.25), it keeps giving me an error and aborts the installation. After that I can see the application as installed in the
 Programs control panel but if I try running it from its folder it doesn't work, Any solutions for this? BTW the camera works in Skype without any problems.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>I verified in <span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Compatibility Center for Windows 10, and</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">it shows as compatible (</span></span></span>Microsoft LifeCam Studio Webcam is the model). The strange is 9 of 9 users&nbsp;said it is
 not. compatible. The lasted drive is for Windows 7 and as I saw it is not works fine in Windows 8.1 neither 10. It is a shame because it is really a very good camera, as I saw it working in Windows 7.</p>

    <title>Laptop keeps freezing after Windows 8.1 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> myriamjoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop keeps freezing after Windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>So my laptop (HP Pavilion g6) keeps freezing and I thought it was the antivirus but nope, it was the windows 8.1 update, the whole computer freezes.</p>
<p>It first starts with my internet slowing down, later if I'm working on something on WORD or PowerPoint it freezes and will not respond, later the taskbar freezes and then the whole laptop freezes except the mouse...</p>
<p>I tried to do a System Maintenance but it didn't show anything, so I went to the Event Viewer and this is what I found, all the "Warning" events have the same text just different times.</p>

            <p>I have been having the same problems on my Surface Pro 3 ever since the March 11 updates. It freezes most of the time while I'm in Outlook although it has also frozen once while I was in chrome (Outlook was open on the laptop at the time). Nothing else was
 changed/added. I have done a virus scan and it hasn't found anything. There is no question in my mind that this has to do with the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually after the 2nd or 3rd time that it freezes during the day I just switch to my MacBook Pro and don't have any of these kinds of problems....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love to know what to do. I am going to take it into the Microsoft store to see what they can figure out and hopefully fix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Was it purchased used from a gaming store such as game stop or was it a brand new S console? Also, are you sure the console was banned and not just a gamertag located on the console?</p>

<p>I'm positive it was brand new...I was with my mom when she bought it. It's an Xbox 360 Elite and when I try to sign in it says, "This console has been banned for violations of the Terms of Use." This is so unfair?!</p>

<p>Take it back to the retailer and ask them to exchange it. Someone probably bought that xbox, got it banned, put it back in the package and returned it. Your retailer put it back up on the shelf for resale and you got stuck with it. Thats what I would try.
 Good luck. </p>

<p>You can still try taking it back, It's possible it was modified and returned, and then got banned when the mods were discovered after you purchased it. Most companies have a 90 day return policy.</p>

            Hi  Turbologic123
<br />
<br />The system crashes are cause by your Nvidia graphics card device drive, there may be an incompatibility between that and a recent Windows Update . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running
