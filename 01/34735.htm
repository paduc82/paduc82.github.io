<h2>            UNAUTHORIZED REMOTE ACCESS AND CONTROL OF PC CANT FIX , PCR7 binding is not supported, Hardware Security Test Interface failed</h2>
                    <p>basically, I have exsperienced my PC taken over by some person/group by overiding my administrative poweres, signings, program install etc.&nbsp; They are based out of Tialand it appears&nbsp; based on some script and pics I have had glimpse of, defiantely characters...</p>
<p>appears many motives, from data collection, phishing to anchoring my pc as vpn or some other network were multiple people can use my keys for windows and surely much more than this...</p>
<p>It has been a long battle&nbsp;</p>
<p>no support form Microsoft, mostly they hang up</p>
<p>Toshiba tries to charge 200$ and i see some people know what to do here, but i cant find it now</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I need to </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Completely</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;disable Unauthorized remote acess to my Pc</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>easily and with speed before, I lose all of them now.&nbsp; these rootkits and what ever they were calling them, have control over my bios on my toshiba as well. cannot do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>three computers total, and it seems this is much now a spreading reality Microsoft and Intel are hiding the severity to me it feels anyway.</p>
<p>like all the other stuff, more mimics to buy..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>other advanced methods are writing code in stuff like snort, allowing you safely use this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to stop, undo the changes and have control so i can install windows.</p>
<p>yes, i have done windows approximately 35 times, many ways and the downloads are caught under every circumstance some where. even airplane disk hard run, to boot leg.&nbsp; I even tried disabling all wifi and in closed basement will little wifi microwave ability.</p>
<p>too many devices hidden and remote virtular adapters, there is twenty on one&nbsp;</p>

            Your best hope is to do a "clean install" of Windows.  I too have heard it is possible for malware to infect the BIOS.  If the malware has infected your malware as you suspect then it is beyond my skill to help you.  
<br />
<br />Short form of what you need to do:
<br />- on a clean computer, (work or a friend's) create a bootable USB with the Windows installation file
<br />- on your systems turn off your router and wifi so there is no internet connection
<br />- install Windows from the USB to the infected computers

<p>you see, i not worried about losing my files, content or settings, I have tried a clean install probably 35-40 times now.&nbsp; I have littereally saved and run copies of windows with the four major languae types, type N, bootleged, and more. I am not pretending
 It is easy to clean isntall with what microsoft has given us, more appears intentionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>but my files, roots and firmware are affected, I have not made one install, were i have not opened my computer without a sign, trace, adn existence of these Rats. there viruses are catching downloasn and executables during and before instal. after in addion.
 I does apper to be everywhere more than people are noticing and for me, its been something like ten weeks fighting, three computers, plus three I puruchased for timeat tempting to have some f deal. well, it apprears that not true, but close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a i need, is a set of instructions that are issued for ISEadmin, to block with force, memote access, then i maybe able to preform a clean install. At least this is the hope, and to fix the lock out of the systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is some info on&nbsp; this and its tricky, but easier than learning laguage and never ending problems..&nbsp; Hinestly, I may not be sucientable.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;some i have had some sucess with are:</p>
<p>setting and updating the defender in powershell, and i believe there isnt any easy wafy else to ensure interuption doenst.</p>

            <p>Yes, the File Explorer method still works, but there's more to the IE method not working. &nbsp;I've had Windows 10 and IE 11 since about a week after Windows 10 availability. &nbsp;Using the View Pull down, Open FTP site in File Explorer method worked for me until
 just 3 days ago (on 11/04/15). &nbsp;I haven't been able to think of any changes that could have affected it. &nbsp;I've rebooted, I've checked all of the above mentioned settings, shut down the firewall, and Antivirus. &nbsp;I even tried changing the settings and then changing
 them back to insure they're really set as indicated. IE just doesn't appear to attempt to launch File Explorer. &nbsp;No errors, nothing. &nbsp;I can't tell when a Windows update last occurred, but based on the dates of comments in this thread I don't think there's
 a particular Windows 10 update that is causing this. &nbsp;Microsoft should eventually find a bug here (hopefully sooner than later.)</p>

            Yes, for me too. File Explorer link to FTP worked in Win7 and in a recent "upgrade" to Win10 no longer works on the same PC with the same components. Seems like a Win10 bug. I can get to the FTP site on IE11 in Win10, but View in File Explorer is dead.
 How many thousands of people tried Win10 apps before release and did not see this?

            If a Windows 10 update clobbered it that update must have been delivered over a 5 or 6 week period based on the dates of the posts in this thread. &nbsp; I don't really know, but I'd be surprised to learn that an automatic update is spread over that much time.
 &nbsp;However, I haven't been able to come up with any solution for something that was working just fine less than a week ago.

            <p>Apache OpenOffice doesn't receive the level developer support it once did. Since it was forked, most development has gone into LibreOffice which includes better Microsoft Office compatibility and Windows compatibility too. So, download and use that instead.

<h2>            Unable to disable touchpad in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Envy and have recently upgraded to Windows 10. I have uninstalled the Synaptics; however, when I restart my computer it is not uninstalled and the Synaptics is still there. I do not like the touchpad and want it disabled or completely uninstalled.
 I am an transciptionist and the touchpad is very disruptive and an absolute hindrance. Please help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try uninstalling the touchpad driver by following the steps below and check if it helps:<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open the run command.<br />
2. Type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>and press <strong>enter</strong>.<br />
3. Expand <strong>mice and other pointing devices</strong>.<br />
4. Right click on the <strong>touchpad driver </strong>and <strong>uninstall </strong>
it.<br />
5. <strong>Restart </strong>the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling the touchpad driver and restart the computer, it will automatically re-install generic touchpad driver. However, you can disable the touchpad option from device manager.

    <title>How to restore a deleted Deny Everyone permission&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snunn  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to restore a deleted Deny Everyone permission&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Attempting to follow some instructions (too late at night), I removed the Deny Everyone List/Read permission from Documents and Settings (yes I know it's not a real folder). Win 7 64-bit, if that matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My intent was to put it back after editing a file. I ended up not doing the edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to put back the Deny, I could no longer get access to the permissions. It won't even display the Docs &amp; Settings owner. This occurs even in administrative mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored from the last Restore Point (last week), but that made no difference to the permissions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I put the Docs &amp; Settings permissions back to their default settings? Or, would leaving it this way put my system at risk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much for any help.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Where
 exactly you are trying to create a new folder?<br />
What exactly happens when you click on new folder?<br />
Do you get any error message?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I would suggest you
 to boot the computer into Safe Mode and check if the same thing happens there, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Safe Mode and press Enter.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then be at the Welcome Screen.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If it is not working even in Safe Mode, then try creating a new user acount and check if it helps, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>1. Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button&nbsp; , clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety, and then clicking User Accounts.<br />
2. Click Manage another account.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3. Click Create a new account.<br />
4. Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type,(Administrator) and then click Create Account.
<br />
<br />
Here is a link that will give you information on how to create a new user account.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that your control panel is blank. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This may be due to corrupted system file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try these steps and check if that helps. </span></p>

            <p>AVG did a pc repair. I do not recommend this program as a fix because it requires a lot of AVG ZEN support because the program loads in bits and pieces and does not load in all browsers. This can be a hair pulling adventure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows SFC ran in safe mode as administrator sounds more logical. It is interesting my windows 8.1 to Windows 10 loaded and is running quite well. I am considering going back to windows 7 or completely reloading windows 7 premium. All set for now!!!!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Unable to install the Printer drivers on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to install the Printer drivers on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have two printers---Brother MFC7860DW and Brother MFC 7360N. I downloaded the printer drivers for each. I ran each program to install. During the installation, it asked if I wanted to connect the computer to the printer wirelessly or directly. I chose
 the USB connection and followed the instructions---connect an usb cable and turn on the printer. But, after that, it stopped installing the driver. This happened for both printer driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any compatibility issues between Brother printers and Windows 10? If so, I will appreciate if anyone knows how to solve this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

<p>Hi Mala,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. Here are more detailed information about the issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>I found that the most current printer drivers were installed in Windows 10 on my computer.
</li><li>The computer (Dell Inspiron 3668 Desktop Computer Windows 10 (64 bit) installed) actually recognizes wireless printers in our office (we are a small non-profit). One of the wireless printers is MFC-7860DW.&nbsp;</li><li>We have two MFC-7860DW printers. One is used via wireless and the other is directly connected to one of the computer via USB cable. Our Windows 10 machine can recognize the wireless printer, but not the one with USB.&nbsp;</li><li>When I connect MFC-7860DW printer or MFC-7360N printer to the Windows 10 computer with USB, Windows 10 does not recognize those printers.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We have two Windows 10 machines (the same Dell Inspiron 3668 Desktop); and both of them have the same issue of not being able to connect to printers via USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions for this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kaoru</p>

    <title>Lumia 550 Windows 10 Missing Mobile &#38; SIM in NETWORK AND WIRELESS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris zarkov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 550 Windows 10 Missing Mobile &#38; SIM in NETWORK AND WIRELESS settings.</h2>
                    <p>I just got brand new Lumia 550 with Windows 10 mobile preinstalled from my operator. Everything was working fine and while in the process of customisation i noticed my 3G connection has disappeared.</p>
<p>Resetting the phone to factory conditions brings it back, but while playing with sounds and colors and apps, the 3G (mobile data) vanishes again, and together with it the ability to send and receive standard mobile text/sms messages.</p>
<p>The menus under NETWORK &amp; WIRELESS - Mobile &amp; SIM also vanishes, with the only text visible on screen being "Learn More" which takes you to windows 10 web site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, hard reset brings 3G back but soon after it disappears, either due to update, app, or just some other setting affects this one. I can give u exact details of which settings and apps i have used. Its a second day of resetting and reconfiguring trying
 to find out **** is going on and what is causing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype, Email configured to read gmail, outlook and icloud, Whatsapp, VIber, Maps, Youtube, Dropbox.&nbsp; Thats it.Settings is nothing fancy but sound, colors, screen magnification and as many features turned OFF as possible, including PIN code.<br />
</p>
<p>The only fancy thing i enabled is under Easy of Use, Magnifier and under More menu, Visual Options - Text scaling set at 150%. TTY and Telecoil are both OFF as default.</p>
<p>Data was enabled and set to 3G last, before it vanished from the menu. Please advice a fix or i am dumping this thing in the bin and will stick with iPhone until it dies out. I can't loose calls or business due to idiotic coding!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Chris,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to run the Windows Phone Recovery tool on your device which will recover it to the basic version of Windows 10 without any updates. A</span>fter going to the basic version of Windows 10, install the latest update for Windows 10 to keep
 it updated and then install all the other 3rd party apps to check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows Phone Recovery Tool</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important!</span></strong><span> Using the Software Recovery Tool will erase all content stored on your phone, including apps and games (along with app data and game progress), text messages, call history, music, photos and more. If possible,
 you should back up your phone first (Settings &gt; backup). You will be able to restore a backup once the recovery is complete.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The recovery process may take some time depending on your internet connection speed, and you cannot use your phone during the installation. The latest approved version of the software in your phone and model will
 be installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.

            <p>Ok, thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting to original settings works. </p>
<p>Also, hard reset - volume down + power off buttons restores the 3G as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly using skype and viber drain the battery rather fast, i need to recharge mid-day. Once im happy with the phone, i will likely buy the 950XL to get the larger battery and give it some speed with apps, after all this was experimental purchase just to
 try Win10 phones. Great improvement over Win8 and Nokia 720 speed-wise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One issue i have is the bluetooth in the car, it connects OK but i dont get the calls/voice, music plays fine.</p>
<p>The old 720 nokia was working well, so is iphone 4-5-6. I wil give it another try today and **** some more if it fails :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.<br />

            <p>I had exactly the same problem and the answer was to remove the sim card and then replace it. This forces a reset of the network connection and it worked ok after that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I was wrong, two days later and same problem and no answer to it yet even though I am on my second phone.</p>

<p>I've done the hard reset several times, but the data/text capabilities keep getting dropped a few hours later - often following turning the phone on after having turned it off.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried a hard reset, used the recovery tool, done a full reset, changed sim cards all&nbsp;without success.</p>
<p>The only thing is I can still make calls but can't use mobile data.</p>

            <p>OK, I might have just stumbled across the incredibly ridiculous (temporary?)&nbsp;work-around for this that doesn't require constantly resetting the phone .... try it and let me know if it works for you too.&nbsp;
</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that your Mobile &amp; SIM settings are screwy by going to the Quick Launch area and Clicking on "All Settings" &gt; Network &amp; Wireless &gt; Mobile &amp; SIM: - the Mobile &amp; SIM screen displays only the "Learn More" link and no settings are displayed.&nbsp; Under these
 conditions you have no mobile data and no ability to send/receive text messages.</li><li>Go back to the Quick Launch area...</li><li>Find the "Mobile Data" item - it is now currently be <strong>un</strong>selected or "dimmed"&nbsp;- as though it is "off".&nbsp; Tap the Mobile Data item so it is selected / "on" again. (or, if it wasn't off... tap it off and on again)</li><li>Turn off the phone</li><li>Turn the phone back on</li><li>In the Quick Launch area, go to "All Settings" &gt; Network &amp; Wireless &gt; Mobile &amp; SIM - I found that the Mobile &amp; SIM settings have appeared again and that I again have mobile data and texting abilities.&nbsp; I hope it lasts for a while - and that I can recreate
 this solution if it shuts off again&nbsp;- because this is a heck of a lot better than having to reset the phone and re-download all the apps and music and podcasts blah blah blah.</li><li>Good Luck!&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>**Addendum: the issue since arose on my replacement phone and this work-around doesn't work on the replacement.&nbsp; I think I'm trading this in on a Lumia 640 or something else. grrr.</p>

            <p>Yes, I have tried all those various options with the same negative outcome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your latest solution but it doesn't work for me, in&nbsp; the first place my mobile data icon in quick settings is lit up before shutting down the phone and on restart it is the same but no data connection even though I can see a connection to the
 network through the strength bar signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, if I have to do a full reset with my bandwidth its a six hour exercise.</p>

<h2>            Maxtor One Touch 500GB External Hardrive cannot connect to Windows 7</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Vista to windows 7 and now my hard drive cannot connect to my computer. i had to download a extracting software (from the maxtor site) so that Vista would see the hard drive on my computer and would recognize it. however, the Maxtor
 site is now merged with Seagate and i can not find the software, nor make my hard drive connect. my computer sees the drive in the "safely remove hardware/ eject media" toolbar, but cannot be found in my computer.

            Hi Valkyrie7,<br />
<br />
<br />
That seems a driver issue. I have found a link on Seagate website about maxtor products downloads. Download the Maxtor one touch software and drivers for this external drive for Windows 7.<br />
<a href="http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&amp;name=ot4-downloads&amp;vgnextoid=0ed72c9e46914110VgnVCM100000f5ee0a0aRCRD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&amp;name=ot4-downloads&amp;vgnextoid=0ed72c9e46914110VgnVCM100000f5ee0a0aRCRD</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If there is no Software or drivers compatible with Windows 7, you can still install those Windows Vista drivers on Windows 7 using compatibility mode installation.
<br />
For more information about compatibility installation refer to the articles below:<br />

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you boot your computer, Windows would detect USB, DVD, HDMI, joystick, card reader etc.&nbsp;or any other non- essential hardware devices which are not essential to load Windows which might cause a conflict leading to improper start up.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore you should boot your computer only with keyboard and mouse&nbsp;connected and check, the next time you decide to install Windows 10 again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow these suggestions below after you install Windows 10 and check if it works for you. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Un-plug all the plug (Net-Gear Wire, Monitor , CPU and Modem and Re-Plug in them )
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen <strong>before sign-in</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span></p>
<p><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></p>
<p><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, Display Port to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></p>
<p><span>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.
</span></p>
<p><span>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the link: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: &nbsp;Applies in Windows 10 </span></p>
<p><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of your monitor. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters </span></p>
<p><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (Try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></p>
<p><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></p>

    <title>Controller and Headset Won&#39;t Reconnect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raysilverstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller and Headset Won&#39;t Reconnect</h2>
                    
<p>Here is my setup:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slim 250GB XBOX 360</p>
<p>2 Official Xbox 360 Controllers&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 Charge and Play Pack powered controller (primary controller)</p>
<p>1 Battery Operated (secondary controller)</p>
<p>1 Wireless Headset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem: &nbsp;</p>
<p>I first started noticing this while watching netflix a few weeks ago. &nbsp;The controller would time out after a while and shut itself off like normal. &nbsp;Then when I go to turn it back on (hold the xbox button) it does not
 connect to the xbox. &nbsp;The lights just keep blinking and the xbox does nothing. &nbsp;Sometimes but not all the time while the first controller is blinking and trying to connect the second controller will connect for me if I try to turning it on. &nbsp;This does not
 happen every time though. &nbsp;The other times it will just blink just like the first one. &nbsp;I just noticed as well that my headset does the same thing. &nbsp;It occasionally does it during games but I don't often have my game paused long enough for my controllers to
 time out. &nbsp;In order to get anything to connect again i have to hit the power button on the console itself then restart the console. &nbsp;It's such a pain to do that every time because then I loose game progress or I have to go all the way back into netflix. &nbsp;I'm
 not sure if it is my console or something I'm doing wrong any help would be great. &nbsp;Distance should not be a problem because I Sit like 2 and a half feet away from my Xbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a related problem or not but my primary controller will sometimes vibrate like normal during game-play but will just keep vibrating until i power cycle my xbox. &nbsp;I'm not sure If the secondary controller does this or not I don't use
 it enough to know. &nbsp;I suspect this vibrating problem might be a sign of the play and charge pack going out. the pack is kind of old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you even suggest it: <b>YES, I HAVE TRIED THE SYNC BUTTON ON THE CONSOLE AND CONTROLLER.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It happens to the second controller but not every time but Yes it does happen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>No it does not seem to happen when the Play and Charge Cable is plugged in but then again the controller does not time out when the cable is plugged in. It just says on.

<p>I would really like to figure out of this is a serious problem because my warranty is up in Sept.</p>

<p>This happens to me as well, but usually when I accidentally disconnect the headset. If I try to plug it back in, I can't talk/hear anything though the headset until I restart my Xbox. I've noticed that this ONLY happens on my Halo 3 controller, and not my
 11 others, so it's a controller problem and has nothing to do with the console or the headset.

<p>Not sure how much that helps.</p>

 believe I have solved the problem. I attempted a fresh installation of Windows 10 on to my brand new "OCZ Trion 150 480 GB SSD". This resulted in the error, "Windows cannot install required files. Make sure all the files required for installation are available,
 and restart the installation. Error Code: 0x8007025D". After reading many FORUMS, this one included and trying all the various suggestions, nothing worked! I borrowed my son's Kingston Hyper X 250 (125 GB SSD), and ran a successful installation with no errors.
 This PROVED that my installation media which I created using Microsoft's media creation tool was just FINE. It also proved that nothing was wrong with my hardware. I suspected that maybe it was a bad SSD that I had. So I went out and bought a brand new "Corsair
 Force LE 480GB SSD". I ran an installation, this resulted in the error, "Windows cannot install required files. Make sure all the files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error Code: 0x8007025D". So could I possibly have
 TWO BAD SSD units? No, not at all... I remembered that my son's SSD was a small volume 125GB drive. So on a hunch I did the following: So I placed my SSD (Corsair) in an external enclosure, connected it to my laptop, formatted (not Quick Format, but Full Format).
 I then created two partitions, Vol1 (125GB - primary) and Vol2 (355GB). I then opened DISKPART and did a CLEAN and then I CONVERTED the volume to MBR from GPT. Next I mounted the SSD back in to my PC. I Reset my BIOS to Factory Defaults just to be safe. I
 Ran the installation on the 125GB partition. WINDOWS 10 installed just fine. So this means that neither of my SSDs were bad, it means Windows 10 FREAKS OUT when installing fresh on large volume SSDs. Possibly anything over 250 GB. Good luck! FYI... How to
 do DISKPART 1. Type Diskpart, press Enter 2. Type List Disk , press Enter 3. Type Select Disk # (where # is the number your drive shows up as), press Enter 4. Type Clean, press Enter 5. Type Convert MBR, press Enter 6. Type Exit, press Enter.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

            <p>It had nothing to do with the the .ISO from you guys. It was the board. I was able to image another machine, then I used that to run the recovery media. It working now. To answer your questions; This is a custom box that I built. I installed Windows 7, in
 order to upgrade to 10 for free. The drive crashed, and for some reason, the error I was receiving was due to the UEFI / Legacy boot modes within the BIOS. The BIOS had a Windows 8/8.1 setting that was turned on, only allowing UEFI boot. This was the cause
 of the errors as I needed it to boot into Legacy mode. I did try to run a Windows 7 install as well, and I received the same error, this is how I discovered the issue. Thanks, for following up! - Brian</p>

<h2>            Safely remove hardware creates disk activity</h2>
                    
<p>I have an external hard drive, it is Bitlocker encrypted. I checked in Performance Monitor, there is absolutely no activity on that drive. Then I try to safely remove the drive, and boom, Security Essentials kicks in on some internal (system volume or so)
 directories. Then comes system which accesses $Mft and some other things, and then comes an error that the drive is in use and can't be removed. Any idea what's wrong and what I can do to fix this (short of logging off or rebooting the system). Is there any
 harm in just pulling the plug when there is no activity?</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 to Xbox One -- Save Imports&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aequitas15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 to Xbox One -- Save Imports&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I had a thought: I'm really anticipating upcoming games like The Witcher 3 and Dragon Age: Inquisition, but since those are choice-heavy RPG games, will there be a way for my Xbox 360 save games to be imported to the new sequels on the Xbox One? Will there
 be some kind of tool to do it? Will it be done through the Cloud? Or will it just not be possible? The plot-lines in those two games, and others I'm sure, are very much player-determined; at many points in those games the player has to make choices that will
 drastically alter the story. I'm concerned that if I want to import my save files, I'll have to get the new titles for my 360, or just buy The Witcher and/or the Dragon Age series on PC and go through those dozens--<em>hundreds</em>--of hours of gameplay all
 over again.</p>
<p>For RPG titles like these, I think the issue of 360 to One save transfer is an important one to address. I hope they do address it eventually.</p>

<p>They should do it if they're smart, imo. It'd be another reason to convince their customers to buy an Xbone instead of a PS4. I'm got the same concern. I've got the Witcher 2 on PC and 360, and according to PCGamer, there's a massive combat overhaul coming
 out later this week (for Witcher 2, if you can believe it) and I want to make some new saves to import. Trying to figure out whether to do it on PC or 360, and the save import function is going to be the decider, I think.

<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image7.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage_thumb5.png%3fw%3d472%26amp%3bh%3d355" /></a></p>
<p>In this scenario, I have a typical Windows 7 setup with some applications installed and some personal files stored in the Documents Library. In this scenario, we are going to upgrade to Windows 7 while looking at how it preserves your existing investments.
</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model.</li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/</a><br />

</p>
<p>If you want to backup themes, wallpapers and other minor features, Windows Easy Transfer is another option, you can learn more about it
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade.</li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed.</li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications).</li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing.</li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Type: MSCONFIG.</li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart.</li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>
<p><strong>32 or 64 bit</strong></p>
<p>My recommendations depend on what you have installed. If you currently have 32 bit Windows 7 installed, use 32 bit Windows 8. If you have 64 bit Windows 7, use 64 bit Windows 8. This is to ensure a smooth migration, especially where driver compatibility
 is concerned. Another factor is RAM. If you have max 3 GBs of RAM, then 32 bit should be sufficient for your needs. If you happen to have 4 to 8 GBs or more RAM, then 64 bit would be suitable.
</p>
<p>Windows 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit
 Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 64 bit is more secure too, malicious
 code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.
</p>
<p><strong>Starting setup</strong></p>
<p>To start the installation, first boot to the Windows 7 desktop. If you are installing Windows 8 from a physical DVD these instructions will apply to you. Insert the Windows 8 disc. When the AutoPlay window appears, click ‘Run setup.exe’. Click Continue when
 prompted by User Account control.</p>

<p>Wait while setup prepares to install Windows 8. </p>

<p>In addition to being able to keep your Windows Settings and Personal files, you can keep your personal files too when upgrading from Windows 7. If you choose Nothing, Windows 8 will place your files in a folder called Windows.old. After making your decision,
 click Next.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image43.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage43_thumb.png%3fw%3d451%26amp%3bh%3d353" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows 8 does some last checks. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image48.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage48_thumb.png%3fw%3d441%26amp%3bh%3d346" /></a></p>
<p>Depending on your configuration, Windows 8 setup might ask you to uninstall a program or driver then restart your system before it can proceed with the upgrade. Don’t worry though, Windows 8 will resume setup automatically. In my case, Windows 8 setup needed
 a restart before it could continue.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image58.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage58_thumb.png%3fw%3d405%26amp%3bh%3d221" /></a></p>
<p>After restarting, Windows 8 setup, asked if I would like ‘Continue from where I left off’. I clicked Next and setup resumed.</p>

<p>At the summary screen, review the changes that will be made to your computer. If you are not sure, click Back and make any appropriate changes. As noted, you will not be able to use your computer during this period. The time it takes to complete the upgrade
 will be dependent on your system specifications such as processor speed, memory and your data set. Click the Install button to begin.

<p>
</p><p>Hello. I was faced with such a problem. On my Asus tablet I was originally windows 8. Update offered me to go to Windows 10. Everything was fine somewhere 5-6 months. Yesterday was once a simple update (I have not even looked what it was). After that, I
 will reboot the tablet and now I have a blue screen with an inscription - BitLocker recovery key.&nbsp;at the bottom explanation, where I can find the key. From my another laptop I went where it was said in the description, and went into my Microsoft account. I
 found right key.&nbsp;After I entered the key, he wrote to me that my PC started to work incorrectly. And thats it. I can`t &nbsp;do anything. I can`t switch on my tablet. And I can`t find any answer on my question on internet.</p>

            I said it wrong. I can turn it on, but he always asks me BitLocker recovery key. &nbsp;Then, after that key, he offers me restart PC (after restarting is all the same), or "Advanced oprions", which include (see picture), but all these advanced options does
 not help to go further.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3759758e-81d4-47e6-92ca-e3579b9fce17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3759758e-81d4-47e6-92ca-e3579b9fce17" /></a>

    <title>Disc tools missing and won&#39;t execute - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennam0621  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc tools missing and won&#39;t execute</h2>
                    <p>Both my Disc Defrag and Disc Clean up tools are missing from the Start &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools section.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found the "Defrag" application and "Defrag.exe.mui" file under Computer &gt; C:drive &gt; Windows &gt; System 32. &nbsp;The Defrag.exe.mui is missing an icon (which I assume means something is amiss).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I double click "Defrag" application to execute a defrag, a black window pops up for a second at most, which is not long enough for me to read even a single word of what the window says. &nbsp;After that, the window disappears and nothing happens.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I double click "Defrag.exe.mui" file to execute a defrag, a system window pops up and asks me to choose a program/file to run it with. &nbsp;So I choose the Defrag application, but the exact same thing happens...&nbsp;&nbsp; a black window pops up for a second at
 most, the window disappears, and nothing happens. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any ideas of as to why this is happening or what I can do to use or fix the defrag app?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a Latitude E65100 running on Windows Vista Business, Service Pack 2, 32 bit OS. &nbsp;It has 4 GB RAM and an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU P8600 @ 2.40GHz 2.40 GHz. &nbsp;I don't know much about computers so I thought I'd give you all the info I could find since
 I don't know what is and isn't relevant.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! &nbsp;:)</p>

            <p>Defrag.exe.mui doesn't have an icon. .mui files contain the language information for a program.</p>
<p>The program that starts a defragmentation from the start menu is C:/Windows/System32/dfrgui.exe.</p>

<p>Is this a company computer which could have had some features disabled?</p>
