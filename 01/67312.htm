<h2>            Windows Surface RT 32GB running Windows8.1 RT cannot be charged&#63;  How and how much to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the Windows Surface RT tablet.&nbsp;&nbsp;using since late 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using tablet with the charger and its magnetic connector.&nbsp; Noticed that light on charge plug was not on even though correctly plugged in.</p>
<p>Notice on the screen indicated it was not being charged.</p>
<p>I bought another charger, but it&nbsp;also&nbsp;would not light.&nbsp; Anything I can do to repair?&nbsp; I went to computer repair shop and they&nbsp;said detected 12 volts out of the charger, not charging the tablet.&nbsp; Thought it would require a $50 connector board to be replaced
 &nbsp;inside the tablet.&nbsp; With their $100 service charge , I would have $150 into it. Does this sound right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Any thoughts on what to do. anything under 100 would be okay.
</p>
<p>200 is the price for a&nbsp; Surface RT on Amazon.&nbsp; At that price point or a&nbsp;little higher , it their a better way to go?&nbsp; Surface RT seems obsolete according to Microsoft since will not be upgraded to 10.</p>

            <p>I suspect that your Fitbit issue may be related to a general failure. In any case, you need to ask Fitbit support if their Windows Store App supports the Fitbit device you are using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't worth fixing or replacing a Surface RT.&nbsp; These are obsolete.&nbsp; You MIGHT consider a Surface 3. Do NOT buy&nbsp; a refurbished Surface RT from Amazon or anyone else.</p>

<h2>            surreptitious charging by Skype</h2>
                    <p>It is a shame that Skype has started to charge me for calls to USA from India whereas from other phones that use Skype app it is free.</p>
<p>I feel cheated.</p>
<p>I want to know why is this act of cloak and dagger policy being enacted by MICROSOFT and SKYPE.</p>
<p>I thought that microft was honest. </p>
<p>NO. NOT ANYMORE.</p>

<p>The free promotion that has been in place for quite some time, still has its limitations as covered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/legal/free-calls-from-india-offer-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. If you are placing calls that are not
 covered, either due to the particular number or by using an outside India ISP, then you would be probably be charged for the call. If that is not the case and only calls you make from all Android devices are being billed, there may be an issue with the client
 that needs to be reported. If you believe you have been actually charged for calls you should not have been charged for, I suggest you contact Skype Customer Service over
<a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
live chat</a> to rectify the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to avoid the possibility of being charged due to an error or not, why not create another Skype account that has no credit or billing information? If the call is not free using that account, credit will be requested and the call will simply not
 go through.</p>

<p>Dear Techfreak_,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chat option in Skype never ever works. Microsoft is going bad and worse.</p>
<p>Microsoft is hurting itself.</p>
<p>My wife has an android phone and she is making free calls to USA. She never purchased anything from Skype.</p>
<p>I was recommending Skype to my associates and friends left -right-center as compared to What's app and other apps. I wont do that again, ever.</p>
<p>Another example is the internet Explorer. In windows 7 they are not upgrading it to Edge. So automatically people are shifting and opting for Chrome.</p>
<p>Microsoft is shooting itself in the foot.</p>
<p>I have already claimed a refund of one purchase.</p>
<p>With the remaining balance I shall simply wait for it to get exhausted. After that it would be BYE-BYE Microsoft and BYE-BYE SKYPE.</p>

<h2>            All sound playing through speakers instead of headphones</h2>
                    Since I updated a general update the other day all sound from my laptop has been playing out of my computer's default speakers instead of any headphones I put in. No settings have been fiddled with and it is clear the update has done something here. Any
 ideas on how to resolve this?&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Dan,<br />
<br />
A corrupted user profile is one of the possible reasons why you are unable to remove the publisher certificates within the Internet option. We recommend that you try creating a new user account and check if you will still encounter the same issue. To create
 a new local user account, you can follow the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
Should you have further queries, feel free to post it.

<h3> a cruel pun  say:</h3>
<h2>            No picture or sound on TV using HDMI</h2>

Halo Reach Xbox 360<br />
<strong>TV:</strong><br />
Samsung 50" LED 1080p/1080i<br />
<strong>Receiver:</strong><br />
Samsung HTC6530<br />
<br />
Our setup is Xbox -&gt; HDMI -&gt; Receiver -&gt; HDMI -&gt; TV. Worked perfectly until 2 weeks ago, we had great picture and could hear the surround sound from receiver. Roommates said an Xbox system update had to download, following which the Xbox is no longer detected
 (no picture, no sound). To troubleshoot, we followed the support page on Xbox.com, but now have had no luck. So far have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replugged all HDMI cables in the system; Xbox -&gt; Receiver, Receiver -&gt; TV. No change.
</li><li>Plugged the Xbox directly into the TV using HDMI, works perfectly. Picture and sound are great but only uses TV speakers since we are not using the receiver. Tried this with
<strong>ALL</strong> of our HDMI cables to make sure it wasn't a faulty cable. All work.
</li><li>When plugged directly into TV, tried changing resolutions in Xbox menu to <strong>
ALL </strong>of the options, nothing gets detected by the TV when plugged into receiver.
</li><li>Tried toggling display discovery off and on, no change. </li></ul>
<p>I know it is not a problem with the receiver because my roommate's PS3 still works perfectly. We have it setup as: PS3 -&gt; HDMI -&gt; Receiver -&gt; HDMI -&gt; TV. We get great picture and sound with it. The
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ONLY</span> difference I can think with the 360 was the system update that downloaded, but I have no idea how that could have changed my console to the point of not being detected at all. Any help would be fantastic,
 since my $700 surround sound system is sitting unused when we play games online.</p>

<p>Hi, the first thing I suggest it resetting the consoles display settings by powering the console on using the guide button on a controller, as the console boots up press and hold the right trigger and Y until the console reboots.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If that doesnt work then you could try hot swapping the hdmi from the receiver to the tv, please be careful doing this and turn display discovery back on before you try this, with &nbsp;the hdmi cable connected to the tv but not the receiver power on your console,
 wait a minute for the console to boot up and then connect the hdmi cable to the receiver. If that doesn't work then try having the hdmi from the receiver to the tv but not from the console to the receiver and try the same steps as above.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions, I tried them all but sadly no change. As a last resort I swapped in my friend's Xbox 360-S and it worked perfectly. To be clear, I had it set as Xbox 360-S -&gt; HDMI -&gt; Receiver -&gt; HDMI -&gt; TV.</p>
<p>At this point I'm inclined to think this is more of a software issue specific to my Reach Xbox. Has there been any update in the last while that could have changed something with my Xbox??</p>

<p>Hi, could you try the steps above with display discovery off please? There was a system update a couple of months or so ago, I doubt it's that though.
</p>
<p>Something else to try would be connecting the console to another tv with hdmi and see if it works and then try it again on your tv. Obviously the hdmi is ok on your console as it works when you bypass the receiver, it just needs a kick to get the handshake
 working again.</p>

<p>Had a thought, hook the console up directly to the tv, set the display settings to 480p, then connect up to the receiver again and try it. If that still doesn't get you a picture then try 720p and finally 1080p and 1080i.</p>

<p>Tried all the resolutions but still no luck, also tried it with other TV's no problems, just gets stuck with the receiver. I guess I'll have to bite the bullet and send the Xbox in to get it checked. Bummer! Thanks for all the suggestions &amp; advice, I really

<p>Sorry but his issue involved un-greying resolution options from the display choices. I don't even get picture on my TV, not to mention sound. I've literally spent the last week sifting through forum suggestions, help articles, and other pieces of advice.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTHING WORKS</span></strong> and frankly I'm getting very frustrated *** around with cables and blindly navigating resolution options over and over again. This problem started immediately following a forced console
 update, so I now I would like to make this Microsoft's problem and not mine anymore.</p>
<p>But again thank you for the suggestions, it was worth a shot at least.</p>

 I test HDMI output. Can you help me.? Do you think is a hardware issue. If I put the bottom, it immediately unmmutes, the same the other way. I have went to Lenovo and updated Bios and RealTek software. Can you help me or give me a clue?

            <p><span>&nbsp;Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes prior to start of this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur only when you play videos?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen with built-in speakers or external speakers?</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state” in the provided link
 to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Try running the audio troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Refer:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3: Verify that the default sound device is set correctly</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure that the default sound device is set correctly for the sound device that you are using. To set the default
 device, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, type Sound in the Start Search box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. Click Sound in the search results at the top of the Start menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c. Click the Playback tab. Notice the check mark next to the default device. For most users, the default device is
 Speakers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Make sure that your audio settings are configured as expected. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>i. On the Playback tab, select the playback device, clickProperties, click the Advanced tab, and make sure that the Default Format is set to the value that you expect. When you finish, close this window to return to the previous window.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ii. On the Playback tab, select the playback device, clickConfigure, and then make sure the configurations are set correctly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the sound settings are set correctly, you are using speakers as the sound device, and your speakers are already
 set as the default device, go to method 3 now.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d. Select the sound device that you want as the default sound device, and then clickSet Default.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>e. Click OK to save your settings and to close the Sound dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Method 4: Reinstall the sound card drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. Click on start button, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. Expand sound, video and game controllers, Right click on the sound card and selectUninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c. Restart the computer. This should install the proper drivers for it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>You may also download and install the latest driver for it from manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Genuine, sealed copy of Windows 10 home cannot be activated because &#34;the product key has already been used on another device&#34;</h2>
                    I recently purchased a copy of Windows 10 home for my new computer, however now that I am using it I realize there is an activate windows watermark in the bottom right of the screen. I try to go to settings to troubleshoot but all I get is:&nbsp; We cant activate
 Windows on this device because the product key was already used on another device. if you think it wasn't used on another device, select troubleshoot below. error code: 0xC004C008. I am not willing to purchase another copy of windows just to get rid of this,
 so is there some way to resolve this issue and prove there aren't any other computers using this activation key?

<h2>            Server 2012 WSUS post installation tasks fail - access denied</h2>
                    <p>I couldn't find the right place to post this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows Server 2012 that had WSUS running on it. &nbsp;One day, it just stopped receiving updates. &nbsp;Several attempts to get it working again failed, so I uninstalled WSUS and re-installed it. &nbsp;WSUS installs fine, but the post installation tasks continue
 to fail. &nbsp;I have tried installing via powershell with no success. &nbsp;I have gone in to group policy (Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights\Log on as a service) and added IIS_WPG, NETWORK, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE,
 NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES. &nbsp;Then done a gpupdate /force. &nbsp;I have specifically given Full control to the C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.3019\Temporary ASP.NET folder to NETWORK SERVICE. &nbsp; The error I am currently receiving is:<br />

<br />
<br />
The specific file name App_global.asax.3ioozbcx.dll does not exist in that location, I assume because NETWORK SERVICE does not have access. &nbsp;However, just for kicks. I made sure that NETWORK SERVICE has full control to that folder, and - to test - I gave Everyone
 full control to that folder. &nbsp; I still get the error.<br />
<br />
Please help as I have come to an end. &nbsp;I am ready to setup a new server and install WSUS on that.</p>

            <p>The ability to burn to the legacy video DVD format was only available on Windows Vista and Windows 7. In Windows 8, 8.1 and 10, the option is no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video DVD format requires a specific format with video encoded in MPEG-2. But that requires a licensing fee be paid. Additionally the DVD format only handles up to 480p (NTSC) / 540p (PAL) vertical resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still absolutely must output in this older format, you can find software that will do it (say DVD Flick or DVD Styler). But you might want to explore more modern options such as just playing the video (.mp4) from a USB stick to a Smart TV.
 Or streaming over a network or via something like Chromecast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option, if you have a Blu-ray player (also included in gaming consoles like XBox 360, PS3, PS4, etc.) is to burn the .mp4 file that Movie Maker creates onto a DVD (manually as a data DVD). That is in H.264 format which is understood by Blu-ray
 players. It won't have any fancy menus, and you are limited to the length of the movie (maybe 30-40 minutes), but it would be in HD quality instead of the older SD format of a DVD.</p>

<h2>            Problema para baixar jogo na live</h2>
                    
<p>Olá galera,</p>

<p>estou com um problema para fazer download do jogo Tomb Raider Underworld na live, como vcs sabem o jogo está gratuito para quem é GOLD, como meu XBOX é de 4GB, coloquei um pendrive de 16GB para efetuar o download, já que o jogo tem 6.6GB, sendo que sempre
 que o download atinge os 32% de baixado, o jogo automaticamente é cancelado, tendo que começar tudo do 0 e sempre que tento novamente ocorre o mesmo problema, alguém saberia me dizer como resolver esse problema, pq já ta ficando chato tentar baixar esse jogo
 e ñ conseguir concluir o download.</p>

<p>Vlw!</p>

<p>JordhanAraujo - Coloca pra fazer o download novamente, as vezes ele apenas sai da lista por ficar inativo, o conteudo baixado do jogo ainda fica lá intacto. (Não delete nenhum arquivo do jogo)</p>

            <p>It is unlikely that this situation indicates a problem. Some addresses are typically used for memory-mapped input/output to various devices.</p>
<p>To check for possible problems with the chips and associated circuitry on the mother board, go to the help system and do a search on&nbsp; Memory test. Follow the suggestions on No. 1 on the resulting list.</p>

            More details of your system would be required for a more complete answer.<br />
<br />
Possible cause:<br />
<br />
1) Video card is built-in on the motherboard.&nbsp; Video cards that manufacturers place on the motherboard "share" the main RAM with the system.<br />
<br />
2) You Windows 7 is a 32 bit version.&nbsp; Microsoft has restricted the usable RAM to 3.00 to 3.25 GB when the "base" syst5em is using the 32 bit "platform."<br />

            My system is running:<br />
<br />
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit<br />
Memory: 4 GB<br />
Graphics: Intel HD Graphics<br />
Hard Drive: Seagate Barracuda 1TB<br />
<br />
I think the integrated video card is the main cause for this issue, because it has to borrow memory from RAM for it to run good.<br />

<h2>            Can you help figure out why my laptop keeps shutting down&#63; Running Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've had an issue with my laptop for a few weeks now where my laptop will shut down unexpectedly when off battery power. As I use my laptop for university, this is a very inconvenient occurrence. On recommendations from HP I have updated the BIOS on my laptop,
 performed a diagnostic test which said my battery was in working order. Have sent my laptop in for a healthcheck which recommended I update my OS to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1, which I have done.</p>
<p>I have checked the Event Viewer for the last unexpected shut down which displayed the message "The Windows Management Instrumentation service has detected an inconsistent shut down":&nbsp;</p>

            You need to update not only BIOS but all other hardware drivers as well. You should go to manufacturer's website and see which all drivers are have updates. You should install the at least imporant ones - Chipset, Display, Audio, Network

            Hi, this worked for me, go to control panel then choose troubleshoot and on the left of this screen choose view all, when the list comes up choose the power troubleshooter option, run the troubleshooter. Then try to shut your pc down then restart, hopefully
 it's fixed. 😉

<h2>            Surface 2 questions with Office and memory</h2>
                    <p>I have a few questions about the Microsoft Surface 2 and Surface 2 Pro tablets that I need to get straighten out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Can you upgrade the memory in the new Surface 2 and Surface 2 Pro tablets later?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Does the Surface 2 and Surface 2 Pro tablets come with Office 2013 or Office 365?&nbsp; Best Buy has both listed on these models and not sure exactly what version is installed.&nbsp; I prefer to use Office 2013 (installed locally) versus Office 365 (cloud and subscription
 -- which is what I don't want to use).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. On the Surface 2 Pro tablets that run Windows 8.1 Pro (not Windows RT 8.1), can you actually install software locally on the hard drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Can you install software locally on the hard drive if the Surface 2 running Windows RT 8.1, or the software available through the Microsoft Store?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to get a few issues cleared up from the confusion in Best Buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am thinking about buying the Microsoft Surface 2 Pro tablet running Windows 8.1 Pro 64GB version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi nipper007,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. No, the memory is not upgradeable (if you mean RAM) however the Pro model comes with 4GB RAM for the 64GB &amp; 128GB models and 8GB RAM for the 256GB &amp; 512GB models.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Surface 2 comes with Office 2013 RT which you can think of as Office Home &amp; Student (Word, Excel &amp; Powerpoint with the added bonus of Outlook).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Surface Pro 2 however doesn't include Office 2013. I then wonder whether BestBuy are throwing in a Office 365 subscription/trial with the Pro model.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Yes, the Surface Pro 2 allows for software installs. Its full Windows 8.1 (rather than the restricted Windows RT) so think of it is a fully fledged laptop in tablet form.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. You can only install apps from the Windows Store in the Surface 2 (RT). So all apps are installed on the Hard drive. The Surface 2 however does allow for its storage to be expanded via MicroSD card (up to 64GB extra) however you can only store media (pictures,
 video, music, documents) on the MicroSD storage.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps clear up any confusion. Please do ask any further questions if needed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a Surface 2 myself and absolutely love it, but the Pro 2 is a phenomenal piece of kit, especially considering the size of it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp;can disable the system protection for the drive by searching for system, opening it, advanced system properties and turn it off on the system protection tab by selecting the drive, clicking configure and setting the option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp;can also just ignore the error, it won't cause any problems!</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. Unfortunately, my TrueCrypt encrypted Volume T:\ is not listed in the System Protection tab. Only my 3 REAL hard drives are in there.</p>

            If YouTube is buffering that means the video isn't being sent to your computer fast enough. This can be because of a slow internet connection, sharing the connection with multiple computers, or if you are also downloading other files at the same time.<br />
<br />
You can lower the video quality of a video - near the bottom right of the YouTube player you can select 240p, 360p, 480p, etc. The lower the number the less likely it is to buffer.

<p>
</p><p>Skype conversation histories are saved in the cloud for a period of time (last 30 days) which you can access across supported platform as long as you sign in to the correct account. Any history older than 30 days will be saved in the device's local hard
 drive depending on the history settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't set your conversation history to forever a year ago, then older conversation will be automatically removed.
</p>
<p>
